negative;"When we got to the room we thought \""hey, cool!"
;
negative;"There are plenty of other better places to stay in downtown San Diego."""
;
negative;"As one of the hotel workers stated, \""I wouldn't stay here for anything.\"" I suggest you take that advice."""
;
positive;We booked a double (two double beds) and it was HUGE by NYC standards!
;
positive;The bed was also about 6 inches from the glass sliding door!
;
negative;I switched away my first room because there was a large gap around the door (perfect size for a crowbar) enabling me to see the freeway through the door.
;
positive;Room was nice, breakfast was a little curious as they have an einsteins bagels in the hotel, but good all the same.
;
positive;And we had a wonderful time.
;
negative;We also left the television on in the front room and left the light on when we went out at night to give the impression that someone was in the room.
;
positive;The hotel is approximately 4 blocks from the Jefferson Memorial.
;
positive;You can get coffee and muffins in the office in the morning, which were pretty good.
;
positive;"There are not enough towel hangers in our bathroom."""
;
negative;However on ariving at the hotel exhausted after a 6 hour flight we were told the hotel had double booked by 30 rooms.
;
negative;"""We booked this hotel through a travel agent and because of the previous reviews, we thought it would be very good."
;
positive;"I would have left if I had been forced to stay in Club Quarters!"""
;
negative;Please understand that most LAX hotels use a common shuttle.
;
positive;Go, trust me you'll enjoy.
;
positive;"It\u2019s one thing to get the aesthetic qualities covered but it\u2019s definitely another to combine it perfectly w/ exceptional service.\n Keep up the good work and looking forward for another hassle free stay at H.K once again!"""
;
positive;Frank, es un empleado muy activo que ofrece informaci\u00f3n sobre todo lo que necesites, como billetes para Broadway, autobuses tur\u00edsticos, transporte al aeropuerto, etc.
;
negative;One was out of service the entire time we were there.
;
positive;The concierge is helpful and they have a restraunt and bar both onsite.
;
positive;Qualit\u00e9 de Service irr\u00e9prochable.
;
negative;Upon check-out, I went to the gentleman who had hailed a taxi for me all week and requested one.
;
positive;"""A very charming hotel at 44th street between 5th and 6th Avenue."
;
positive;The couch was very comfortable for me.
;
positive;And the Memphis Zoo is rated as the best in the country, but unfortunately we did not have time to visit the zoo.
;
positive;"i would rate it Excellent if only the check-in wasn't so frustrating."""
;
positive;The rooms were not very big but I think that is typical for New York.
;
positive;Like a room that could not accommodate bedside tables, and limited space in the bathroom so room robes were available only upon request.
;
negative;The room didn't look very clean but the bed was good and appeared clean.
;
positive;The staff is also super friendly and helpful and they really make you feel at home.
;
positive;TV could be better: a bit cumbersome to use and the choice of non-US channels is limited (no BBC, no German, no French).
;
positive;"All of the staff members we encountered were all very friendly and welcoming which made the stay even more enjoyable."""
;
positive;This was great for us as we decided not to drive on this trip.\nThey also gave us printed walking directions to local stores.
;
positive;you can reach your bedside table while sitting on the toilet.
;
positive;"""\u0399 stayed in (Cold) January with my wife for 8 nights at the hotel Surrey."
;
positive;I had everything I needed in my kitchenette and bath.
;
positive;"I must say though, the Marina Marriott's organization and engineering of this very large hotel is amazing."""
;
positive;Well, not horrible, but bad nonetheless.
;
positive;"""The Bulfinch in Boston, Ma, USA is een smaakvol ingericht en comfortabel hotel."
;
positive;Only other thing I didnt like was the fact that they blasted the AC and the only way to warm the room up was by turning on the heat.
;
positive;Lots of pillows.
;
negative;We had to ask the front desk 2 times why they didn't care or even tried to recover it wasn't until the bride called the manager that we got what we were promised but only two for the one day.
;
positive;This is where I am staying for now on!
;
negative;We had no problems at check-in, but when we went to our room we had been given a small room with two double beds--not the suite that we had reserved.
;
negative;I only noticed it when the A/C was off.
;
positive;A/V services is great and even checks in with you each morning to make sure your needs have not changed.
;
negative;About the time we got settled in and was going out for dinner, we checked the door from the hallway after closing it and it would not lock.
;
positive;Overall, a great experience with my first time in DC.
;
positive;Despite it being only 5 minutes walk from 5th Ave and about 10 from Times Square I did feel a bit vulnerable walking back to the hotel at night.
;
positive;In fact I think it is an apartment complex turned hotel.
;
positive;The room was fairly large and clean, the beds ok (felt a bit old but not bad).
;
positive;The next day she recognized me and asked me how my stay was.
;
positive;Our room was right on the water and the views of the ever-changing port were unbelievable.
;
positive;It is an easy 5 minutes walk to Pike Place Market, arguably the soul of Seattle.
;
positive;I hate paying $10/night for internet, though, but I had no choice.
;
positive;In any case, there is a terminal in the bar which you can use FOC and even a printer if you need to print off a boarding pass.
;
negative;The person at the desk discounted the room to $129.00 a night.
;
positive;Pratico il cucinino con macchina caff\u00e9 americano e buste caff\u00e9, microonde, frigo ecc... Gentile il personale, pulito bagno con cambio quotidiano di asciugamani morbidi.Coccole anche nei saponi, shampo e balsamo, indicati come naturali.
;
negative;It was 10:30 at night and we were stranded with nowhere to go.
;
positive;We went to Boston (from NYC) for a weekend girls' trip to celebrate a birthday.
;
positive;Looks like the hotel has been recently renovated.
;
positive;The double bed was quite small for 2 people to share.\nThey do a parking service at the hotel which costs $40.
;
positive;We both thoroughly relaxed and will stay at the Conrad again when we return to Indy.
;
positive;Es un hotel sencillo, sin pretensiones, pero que re\u00fane condiciones importantes en NY: est\u00e1 muy bien ubicado, las habitaciones son limpias, el ba\u00f1o correcto y las camas c\u00f3modas.
;
positive;And try the sea bass...very good.
;
positive;I had a great experience at this hotel.
;
positive;For a guy working the midnight shift at a hotel near the airport in Columbus, you would think he was a lottery winner.
;
positive;The energy and electrical system was a Nice add feature, just be sure to put your key in once you get into the room.\nI did experience a shuttle pickup mishap (we will it that) it did take some time to get picked up but the wait want all that long cause when I finally arrived I was pleased.\nThey did everything they could to make my stay enjoyable.
;
positive;It took us about 35 or 40 minutes, but we got to do some sight seeing along the way.
;
negative;J'ai fais le tour de la chambre afin de v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence de moisissure ou de 'bed bugs' et \u00e0 ma grande joie, je n'ai rien trouv\u00e9!
;
positive;Neat floor to ceiling windows.
;
positive;\nOverall, if you don't want to spend too much while in LA but want to stay in a comfortable and convenient hotel, this is it.
;
positive;Hatte ein Doppelzimmer, weil die Einzelzimmer schon alle ausgebucht waren, was von der Gr\u00f6sse her sicher ein Vorteil war.
;
positive;The two queen mattresses were firm and the sofabed was thin.
;
positive;"""I've stayed in the River North area of Chicago five times within the last six years, and this property is by far the best I have experienced."
;
positive;\nService: The valet parking was quick and friendly.
;
positive;Lediglich Fisherman's Wharf ist mit einem gem\u00fctlichen und sehr sch\u00f6nen halbst\u00fcndigen Fu\u00dfmarsch zu erreichen.\nAndere Ziele wie Union Square, Embarcadero, Financial District, China Town, North Beach, Haight/Ashbury, Golden Gate Park,Twin Peaks etc.
;
negative;The sink also became clogged if you ran the water more than a dribble.\nThe place was clean but felt dirty.
;
positive;Everything was perfect.
;
positive;We paid $200 each for 2 connecting rooms, and I would not be happy if we'd paid near rack rate ($300-400).
;
positive;You could simply tell there was a lot of though behind everything in the hotel rooms.\nValet service for meetings was 100% reliable, car running and air / heat was on and ready.
;
positive;"""I checked into this hotel a few days ago."
;
positive;"We'll be back!"""
;
positive;I relaxed on the lounge chair friday night looking at the lights in downtown SA, sooo relaxing\nAll in all great stay!
;
positive;"""This is my first time ever writing a review for a hotel so please excuse me if I do not use the correct verbage."
;
negative;I did call and voice me concerns and i talked to several hotel associates no one could help and just argued with me so i gave up.
;
positive;Great panoramic view of Thomas Circle and a well-stocked minibar.\nNo coffeemaker, so we called down to the front desk and they promptly sent up a Keurig - finally, a hotel that invested in Keurigs - this seems like such a no-brainer to me when it comes to in-room coffee service.
;
positive;"The two items that failed to impress were a tiny, dated TV (maybe a 21\""?)"
;
negative;I would have to think twice before going back to this hotel again.
;
positive;All in all a pretty blurry weekend.
;
positive;There are garages a few blocks away that are more reasonable.\nI still love the Sofitel which is directly across the street, but I've found a new hotel which is every bit as good.
;
negative;Dennoch mussten wir den vollen Preis zahlen und wurden auch noch angeschnautzt, als wir uns \u00fcber das Fenster beschwerten, das nicht zu ging.
;
positive;Lobby and public spaces were very nice.
;
negative;Here is the truth.
;
positive;Had we wanted to do so, we would never have needed to leave the hotel for dining because the food was that good.
;
negative;Also the concierge was not helpful, repeatedly trying to get you to eat at their places, not even recommending taking the shuttle to the nearby mall.
;
positive;"Initially unhappy with room allocated (it was designed for handicapped people) but room changed with minimum of delay by helpful front desk staff.\nThis is a great location from which to explore all NY has to offer and is recommended especially when booked on line with hotel"""
;
positive;"\""We Love New York\""..................."""
;
negative;\nWe squeezed the roll-a-way in and we even joked about it looking like the large bed from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory becuase we were all butted right up against each other.
;
positive;"The best Marriott I've ever stayed in."""
;
positive;One morning as he admired it the lovely gentleman opened up his car and let him sit in it.
;
positive;For this purpose, the hotel was excellent.
;
positive;Wonderful and friendly staff.
;
positive;Wer aber nicht so viel Geld f\u00fcr seine Unterkunft in New York ausgeben weil, weil man dort ja sowieso nicht viel Zeit verbringt, der ist hier gut aufgehoben und f\u00fcr den Preis, den man hier f\u00fcr ein Zimmer bezahlt, bekommt man so schnell nichts vergleichbares.\nWir waren zu dritt f\u00fcr eine Woche in New York und bekamen ein Vier-Bett-Zimmer.
;
positive;The room was shockingly small!
;
positive;Purtroppo la connessione internet \u00e8 a pagamento.
;
positive;Great showers, but take a 'sucking hook' if you want to hang your towel.
;
negative;This property's management as a whole (this includes the General Manager) was not proactive at all when I was in need of assistance or compensation.
;
positive;\n3.
;
negative;The only thing that happened was that we were locked out of our room because front desk blocked our key card as the staff member who registered us could not count the days of our stay correctly.
;
positive;"\nThere are a lot of nice riverwalk hotels, but if you are a Hilton program member you can't go wrong here in the brand new rooms."""
;
negative;I had to flush the toilet by removing the tank cover and reaching my hand inside the tank.
;
negative;I remembered a review \nsaying they had stayed at a renovated room in\nthe Sterling hotel, so we decided to go check the\nSterling one more time.
;
negative;When I was awakened by their loud conversations taking place in the hallway (again) at 3:30 a.m., I placed a call to security.
;
positive;Ich hatte den Eindruck das Hotel ist schon \u00e4lter und wurde renoviert, zumindest der Part wo wir waren.
;
positive;Our room was on the 22nd floor, and on July 2nd, we watched fireworks from our window...it was great.
;
positive;Als einziger Wermutstropfen m\u00fcssen die hohen Einlagerungsgeb\u00fchren f\u00fcr das am Abreisetag noch zu deponierende Gep\u00e4ck gelten, sofern der Abflug zur\u00fcck nach Deutschland erst am Abend vorgesehen ist.
;
positive;wird nicht gegeizt.
;
positive;There was plenty of parking, though.
;
positive;"""I had been booked at the Washington Court Hotel for a conference."
;
negative;\nThe lobby is very nice, the linens are luxurious, and the location is good.
;
positive;"The staff was extremely helpful and quick to respond to our requests.\nThe third floor is a nicce quite spot to relax and get away from the 'hustle & bustle' of the city."""
;
positive;"""Hotel muito bem localizado, muito pr\u00f3ximo do inneharbor, podendo ir a p\u00e9 para toas os pintos principais da cidade, inclusive o Aqu\u00e1rio."
;
positive;Walked to Times Square, Theaters, Central Park, 5th Ave shopping, Rockefeller Plaza (they still had the tree there).
;
negative;I think the Crowne took advantage of captive hotel guests.
;
positive;"""We stayed at the Magnolia Houston for a wedding and the service was excellent."
;
positive;Check out all the historic photos.
;
positive;"""My partner had never experienced the great shopping that the Dallas area had to offer, so we decided to take a weekend shopping trip to the Big D. I wanted to choose a hotel that was close to a major shopping area so we chose the Westin Galleria."
;
positive;I had heard that Sable was amazing, but hadn't tried it last time.
;
positive;"Buses and taxis are easy ways to get around if walking is a problem."""
;
positive;!\nWe didnt wait any longer than a couple of minutes for the lift despite their being a large queue most of the time., The express checkout was a dream and I never experienced problems with the wi-fi.\nWe had a problem with the heating and the engineer came within minutes and was very helpful.
;
negative;We were too busy for swimming anyhow.
;
negative;The rooms are old, not particularly clean, dark, bleak and just plain worn out.
;
positive;"I did go \""budget\"" on the room but the room was great."
;
positive;Every time, I have visited, I have been fortunate enough to receive his excellent customer service attitude.
;
positive;We had a lot of water pressure.
;
positive;"We will definitely be back to stay at the Waldorf."""
;
positive;\nMost hotels in midtown Times Square area will offer standard King and Double Queen beds.
;
positive;The room I stayed in was one the second floor and a little noisy.
;
positive;"Love, Love, Love this place and will be back when we are in DC again."""
;
positive;These reviews did not do him justice.\n He helped us select a restaurant among a list of about 40 on the hotels list.
;
positive;\nThe staff was friendly and accommodating.
;
negative;The wallpaper and bed linens were stained and ripped.
;
positive;"""We stayed at this hotel for a family trip to the Ft Worth Zoo."
;
positive;and we could hear that door open & close.
;
negative;Minimal to no amenities- no coffee/tea, toiletries, fridge, microwave, of course no breakfast.
;
positive;It is located in a great location for nightlife activities and I didn't notice a lot of disturbance from the bar crowd.
;
positive;We stayed in room 716 which had an excellent view of a corner street below.
;
positive;"""We had read some negative reviews on this hotel, and were a little bit interested to see what our experience was."
;
positive;The free manager's reception included homemade salsa, cheese trays, fruit, veggies, pasta salad, snacks and bowls full of candy which our kids loved!
;
positive;The pool is large with lots of chairs, and the hot tub is large (30 people) and hot.
;
positive;The coffee (Green Mountain) is free and good quality and is ready in about 3 minutes.
;
negative;Geldtausch etc.
;
positive;"""Somos uma fam\u00edlia de 5 pessoas e ficamos no apartamento com 2 quartos (cama king e o outro com 2 singles), um dos filhos dormiu no sofa-cama na sala, e todos ficaram satisfeitos."
;
negative;Having called the hotel and asked them about services because I am traveling with my handicapped wife, I was assured that they had Valet parking and a ramp.\nArriving at the hotel at 4:45pm we were told the room was not ready and it would be an hour wait.
;
negative;The bathrooms are tiny with VERY little counterspace and the TVs are kind of outdated.
;
positive;We also were pleased that we now had a balcony which overlooked the bay and the palm trees as opposed to boats.
;
positive;We booked a couple of weeks ahead and got an $87 rate for a king bedroom with a nice city view.
;
negative;"Non mi sento di consigliarlo a famiglie."""
;
negative;We went out for dinner, and upon our return at 10:30 pm found it still had not been cleaned.\nWe could not wait to leave on Sunday.
;
negative;The hotel from the outside looks great and the lobby is quite posh but the room we had was probably the worst room I have ever stayed in EVER!\nThe room had two single beds and was tiny, the carpet was filthy, the walls were chipped and dirty, the hardware on the door was broken, the bathroom was a nightmare, ceiling was peeling and mold was clearly visible.
;
positive;The front desk staff treated us like VIP's as we were given a large clean room with King size bed, and it's own full kitchen on the 37th floor overlooking Manhattan.
;
positive;The continental breakfast was nice as well.
;
positive;Also, the hotel is in a great location for restaurants, theatre, night clubs, etc.
;
positive;"Would definately recommend and would stay again in the future."""
;
positive;The hotel is smack dab in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf area.
;
negative;\u00a0Then as my husband inspected the room he notice little hairs in the bed and the comforter torn on the inside.
;
positive;Being right on the Park gives you a chance to enjoy one on NYC's treasures.
;
positive;The hotel itself is well maintained, offering comfortable and spacious accommodations.
;
positive;Very clean room.
;
positive;From the front desk to maintenance and housekeeping we were treated like royalty and friends.
;
negative;"I discovered that the wall paper was peeling; the room and bed were smaller than agreed upon; the comforter was torn; there were cobwebs on the windows; and to top it off, there was a substance on the wall which appeared to have properties consistent with dried blood to the right of the headboard.\nBased upon my experience with room #1511 and now, #1510, I contacted Priceline's customer service line and spoke to a service rep."
;
positive;Great location.
;
positive;Decor of the property is very tasteful and I will DEFINITELY be back.
;
negative;Telephone at bedside did not work.
;
positive;"""Dont let the neighborhood deter you; everything about the hotel is first class."
;
positive;We were however disappointed with the breakfast facilities.
;
negative;We stayed for five nights, the second day I asked if the TV reception was bad in every room and I was told yes with no further explanation.
;
positive;The front desk people were also very friendly and helpful.
;
positive;One of our friends reported his room as being very cold, but ours at least was quite comfortable.
;
positive;"When we go back to San Antonio you can bet we will stay at the Crowne Plaza."""
;
positive;Then, he emailed us to make sure that we were happy and even asked us how the concert was that we were going to?
;
positive;The suite was confortable and the resteraunt and bar were great.
;
positive;"Would highly recommend!"""
;
positive;To top this, the rooms are fabulous, big with great decor and safe with great TV facilities free and pay channels as well as a large swimming pool and fitness facilities.
;
negative;She said since I am signing in without reservations the price went up.
;
negative;Again, I was prepared for this.
;
positive;\nI only ate breakfast at the hotel and the buffet was expensive, but it is convenient and quick so I didn't mind too much.
;
positive;Anyway, the shuttle from the airport is free and very convenient at LAX.
;
positive;Only 2-3 blks to Market to catch street cars and other public transp.\nWe had not expected the adjoining restaurant to be so good.
;
negative;The street traffic noise was rough.
;
positive;"I'll certainly stay here again."""
;
positive;The location is great, walking distance to Millenium Park, Magnificint Mile, the Billy Goat Tavern and other great local treats.
;
negative;\nWe arrived on the first leg of our honeymoon and the staff at the desk were friendly and allocated us our room.
;
positive;We paid $200 a night for Sat - Mon night of xmas week, which I considered quite reasonable.
;
positive;The rooms are spacious but dated.
;
positive;We were only in town for one night for a RHCP concert at the Pepsi Center.
;
negative;This hotel, or perhaps more accurately, motel was nowhere near the standards of luxury.
;
positive;Frankly, typical NYC with lots of construction and repair going on around the city.\nThe Muse is a great spot as it is close to Broadway shows, restaurant row, Central Park etc.
;
positive;I definately will be back as soon as possible.
;
positive;"""The room was clean and comfortable."
;
positive;Lobby itself is beautiful and modern.
;
positive;Aber wenn man sich ein bisschen arrangiert, geht das schon f\u00fcr die Urlaubstage.\nKlimaanlage ist vorhanden, weil man die Fenster wegen der Lautst\u00e4rke von der Stra\u00dfe nicht \u00f6ffnen sollte.
;
positive;Mit dem Preis waren wir sehr zufrieden.
;
positive;The room was clean and attractive, the beds comfortable with nice linens and a typical flat screen tv as you expect to find in any decent hotel these days.
;
positive;Great view of Alcatraz when going up the hill on the cable car.\nWould definitely stay at this hotel again as i loved the Fishermans Wharf location.\nWould definitely recommend a tour to sausalito -- this is an amazing little village!!
;
negative;The room did not come with breakfast and there wasn't even a coffee maker in the room.
;
positive;Location is perfect for both the business and the pleasure I was engaged with in Philly.
;
positive;"""I found the room to be clean and welcoming."
;
negative;In addition, they credited our daily passport fee and most of the parking fee, so I was very grateful which is why I rate their customer service Very Good.\nSo my main complaint is that considering the cost to stay here, this resort should be paying more attention to detail.
;
negative;I attempted to contact management for two days.
;
negative;Not a very safe area--multiple homeless folks and shooting occurred 1 block away while we were there.
;
positive;How do you re-use towels when you - for example -must layer your bath towel onto your damp hand towel?
;
positive;\nThe location is wonderful, especially if you appreciate being right next door to Little Tokyo, with its Japanese markets, restaurants, and the Kinokuniya Bookstore.
;
positive;The parking was shared with the surrounding office buildings so it was confusing as where the hotel guests could park.
;
positive;They did share that the spa king included an upgraded bathroom.
;
positive;We also walked to Union Square, Chinatown.
;
positive;"Vi \u00e8 inoltre una piscina, putroppo ombreggiata per gran parte del giorno."""
;
positive;I was very pleasantly surprised.
;
positive;Even if you're going for a short period of time, you MUST go to G-Spa, and treat yourself to the Fitness Facial, which was designed by Sonya Dakar, and uses silica-rich Fiji Water to hydrate.
;
negative;\n3.
;
positive;"""I recently traveled to Jacksonville from Tallahassee for a business and I happen to stumble upon Sun Suites driving in off the highway for a bite to eat."
;
positive;"Approximately 250 square feet.\nAC was a little noisy since room is so tight.\nWould recommend a little bigger room if price is not too much extra.\nStaff was friendly & helpful when needed."""
;
positive;"He immediately went to the Front desk counter, picked up a brochure and said \""here..."
;
positive;I think that says a lot for a kid to want to stay in No.
;
positive;"""Good service rules over all else, and they wowed me."
;
positive;The room was very comfortable and spacious with a splendid view over the city.
;
positive;We love it here.
;
positive;The front desk staff was superb.
;
positive;The aftermath of events in Union Square can last 'till 4am or later... and street noise picks up around 6.
;
positive;We stayed there for its proximity to our new home.
;
negative;Although the room was small it was no smaller than any other NYC hotel room, but for obvious reasons the window didn't open (I assume that they frown on people or objects being ejected from the 34th floor).
;
positive;Top notch all the way!!
;
positive;Neither had been made.
;
positive;Unfortunately, the eggs were cold.
;
positive;I think at a hotel like this, they should know how many people are in the room.
;
negative;Plus, you're willing to overlook small things to be close to family and not pay out the nose.\nAlways before, this was a family-friendly place.
;
positive;Mela is a small hotel--maybe 10 rooms per floor with a small lobby.
;
positive;We ask to change room because the first one assigned was used by someone who smoke and did not respect the hotel rules.
;
positive;The only other negative was the poorly staffed front desk.
;
positive;The door men were very helpful and friendly in getting a taxi.
;
positive;Breakfast is excellent.
;
positive;I also don't know about the charges for things in the rooms - I either didn't use it or my business paid for it, so I didn't pay attention.
;
positive;"my room looked right down on times square.\nOverall a great hotel, just the bell hops need a bit of help at check out"""
;
negative;It tasted burnt and soapy at the same time.
;
positive;"""I've stayed at the Oxford a few times and without fail each time I'm had a wonderful experience."
;
positive;"For further exploring the subway close by is easy to use and a bargain if you buy an unlimited ride $27 pass for 7 days."""
;
positive;"Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good location and a friendly atmosphere."""
;
positive;Bed was almost too comfy, and huge.
;
positive;"""Stayed at The Sanctuary and was so impressed, we got home and booked it for another stay."
;
positive;We ate and the Daily Planet and are all dying to go back for one of those amazing chicken pies.
;
positive;We couldn't get food or anything.
;
positive;"Other than that, staff were professional and friendly."""
;
positive;The location is great!
;
negative;"Die Bauarbeiten bei der gro\u00dfe Baustelle drei Grundst\u00fccke weiter, lie\u00dfen das ganze Hotel erbeben."""
;
positive;Valet parking was extortionate last year, and still is.
;
positive;There was also no in-room coffee, which is pretty standard at other 5-star properites where I've stayed.
;
negative;I was greeted by a wonderful staff, and when I arrived in my room, I found they put me in a room that was for handicap acess, which I did not request or need.
;
positive;The only problem is the size where you have the breakfast but you can come down and take your breakfast to your room.
;
positive;"You're only other options are to pay 2 or 3 TIMES as much at a \""chain\"" hotel (Marriott, Hilton, etc) or stay in a hostel with shared bathrooms...."
;
positive;C'est un endroit central pour partir \u00e0 la conqu\u00eate de NYC et finalement rare.
;
positive;It must also make the job of the cleaning staff extremely difficult over ca.
;
negative;Well this is a less then appealing hotel.
;
positive;However the spacious suites are worth it, in our opinion.
;
positive;Very firm but I have slept in worse.
;
positive;We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted by the bellman/concierge(?)
;
positive;The hotel itself is very nice and clean.\nThe bellman took our (4 large) bags up to our room quickly for us and we headed back out (stopping to ask the concierge the best way to the car drop off location - he was helpful and gave us a map).\nOur room was a good size and everything was very clean the whole time we were there.
;
positive;"""We had a truly relaxing stay."
;
positive;:) The beds were oh so comfortable, i wish i could have shipped them back home to the UK!
;
positive;Fitness center is fresh and vibrant with more than enough machines/equipment.
;
positive;"""We have stayed at this hotel three times now."
;
positive;Lobby is beautiful and there's a fun little sitting area with a big fireplace.
;
positive;Outside of a small deli on the first floor of a nearby building, there did not seem to be anywhere to eat within a reasonable walking distance of this hotel.\nSo in summary, my initial dislike was overcome.
;
positive;Walgreens and Starbucks right across the street, and a bagel store right around the corner.
;
positive;We got into the city\nafter midnight and took a nightmarish ride out of the Twilight Zone to the hotel.
;
negative;parking was $25 a day!!!!!
;
positive;There are plenty of places to eat nearby (notably Pershing Square opposite Grand Central for the best breakfast ever!)
;
negative;Photos trompeuses.
;
positive;"Newly remodeled at a cost of $12 million."""
;
negative;I didnt authorise payment and told them to call when I got back to the UK yet they left me a message whilst I was still in NY and then charged my card!
;
positive;"Lots to do in the neighbourhood.\nWould definitely stay here again for the same price."""
;
positive;"""Conveniently located, friendly hotel staff, fun, swanky, clean rooms."
;
negative;45 minutes later a housekeeper brought some ice.
;
positive;"""This was a really nice hotel."
;
positive;If you don't like walking taxis are available at a very good rate.
;
positive;The manager was very helpful with directions to get around.
;
positive;"There is no doubt we will stay again."""
;
positive;You do need a car because it's not walking distance to attractions.
;
positive;The staff is fantastic!
;
positive;"""I have had the opportunity to stay at the Royal Palms on several occasions - all for meeting."
;
positive;All the staff are very, very helpful with questions or needs.
;
positive;What buffet does not have a pancake or waffle???
;
positive;While researching hotels on the internet, I stumbled upon Apple Core Hotels, and NYMA fit the bill perfectly for our needs.
;
positive;So staying at On the Ave, was a last minute choice, when I got stuck one evening having to stay for a last minute meeting the next morning.
;
negative;You know its bad, when my husband came out of the bath room and said.. DON'T take a shower WITH OUT your flip flops on.. My gym has better looking showers!!!!
;
positive;This hotel is also unique in that it has free parking, which can cost an additional $25-$35 per night at other hotels in the area.
;
positive;First off, location is great, about a 15-20 ride from the airport.
;
positive;Instead of getting in line to check out, they provided your bill at your door on your last day.
;
positive;They were so kind, and even extended out check out (TWICE) to accommodate our travel due to long metro lines after the race.
;
positive;Given that the room was not huge, I was impressed with the amount of furniture it had without it feeling at all cramped.
;
positive;We stayed in the Ballet Suite, the smallest room on the property, and although it was small it was Very comfortable.
;
positive;"\nThis was a nice stay and I would recommend to anyone who needs to stay in the area."""
;
positive;I was happy to find that they don't charge you for local phone calls (to any number in the US) made from the room.
;
negative;I could go on and on and HEIDI CORDES could reply kindly ti this e-mail.
;
positive;I've stayed here a few times -- on purpose-- and here's what you get.
;
positive;There was the usual supply of toiletries.
;
positive;The bar was in the process of closing and they even went out of their way to provide two complimentary drinks for my guest and me.
;
positive;Our room overlooked the front of the hotel -Powell Street - and I was amazed at how well our window blocked out the sounds of the people, of the cable cars, etc.
;
positive;Across the road is the Original Pancake Parlor.
;
positive;\nThere is a bar and an Italian restaurant on the ground floor with a small sitting outside area, we didn't try these as we already had plans.\nThe hotel is very convenient for shopping, restaurants/bars and for the metro.
;
positive;The only con was the room was very dated, old carpet and furniture.
;
positive;"Il personale gentile e disponibile."""
;
positive;I told my BF he might want to call to confirm prior to his arrival which he did.
;
positive;Excellent food and very popular with New Yorkers walking in off the street.\nWe also had an excellent view of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from our room.\nNo problems with noise as we were located on the 11th floor.
;
negative;"I am quite fussy, but I am surprised at high reviews for this place."""
;
positive;I had a view of Union Square from my window, and thus was able to enjoy all the offerings in the area.
;
positive;"""This hotel would have to be the best location to everything."
;
positive;The hotel is located next to the Westlake Center with rail transportation to both Seattle Center at the Airport.
;
positive;Nei pressi cmq dell'Hotel ci sono tante fermate di metropolitana.\nL'albergo \u00e8 pulito, silenzioso e la biancheria viene cambiata giornalmente.
;
positive;The Andaz provides a small quantity of complimentary snacks and beverages in the room.
;
positive;Staff were friendly & helpful.
;
positive;The staff were friendly and helpful.
;
negative;"When I called, the desk clerk mumbled into the phone and I had to ask if I had the right number.. Then in a snotty tone, he imformed me that \""you know, accounting is only here during the day.\"" I would only stay here again if they changed management."""
;
positive;The restaurant had great food, attentive staff as well.
;
positive;The king-size bed (from the pillows to the mattress) was so comfortable and relaxing.
;
positive;The area around it is okay, a bit grungy but nothing out of the ordinary for an urban academic area.
;
positive;"Have a nice day :-)"""
;
positive;Kids convention seemed to be in town.
;
negative;"""I booked this hotel through a travel program."
;
negative;We were told no problem.
;
positive;First of all Katie is the most adorable young lady.
;
positive;Room was on the small side, which was no big deal, since the bed was huge and very comfortable.
;
positive;The 77th and \nBroadway location is excellent.
;
positive;5 minuten van Times square, binnen een kwartier in Central Park, Fifth avenue en Madison Square Garden.
;
positive;The only fault was the carpet could use a replacing.
;
positive;It was within 5 minutes walk to Penn Station, Macy's, Times Square, etc.
;
positive;It was our firt time going to Boston.
;
positive;Petit d\u00e9jeun\u00e9 compris.
;
positive;The staff is always friendly and helpful.
;
negative;Then I asked if the Westin actually thought I chose to eat and drink the entire mini bar once?
;
negative;There was no gaurantee that we would have a room with a view unless we paid $20 more a night, so we choose to pay.
;
negative;On a sunny day, only a twilight glow came in, since my room looked straight into another hotel room, across a dim alley.\nThe electric outlets recess into the wall when one attempts to plug something into them, forcing me to charge my cell phone in the bathroom-- which lacks a tub or space to turn around.
;
positive;Evening wine, morning coffee, daytime jellybeans in the lobby were all nice touches.
;
positive;"*Of course* we went out to Times Square, and this hotel always gave us a homey feeling when we walked back in."""
;
positive;We ate there so much because the Landing was the pits.
;
positive;"""Very nice Sleep Inn located about 10 minutes from the airport in Charlotte."
;
positive;The buffet was only $9.99 and the food was great!
;
negative;\n Two of the four mornings I was there, the maid service barged into my room while I was in the bathroom, scaring me half to death.
;
positive;One night on the beds/pillows would've been okay...two was just too many.
;
positive;\nCons: There was noise - both from the bar, and from the circle, but it didn't bother us.
;
positive;We were able to go out and see the sites and then come back in the afternoon for a rest before heading out in the evening once again.
;
positive;"""Overall nice place to stay."
;
positive;The spa is fabulous too.
;
positive;Nous avons fais beaucoup de recherche pour choisir l'h\u00f4tel et n'avons pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7u.H\u00f4tel tr\u00e8s design et d\u00e9co tr\u00e8s recherch\u00e9, tr\u00e8s contemporain.Le bar (Aspen) est un savant m\u00e9lange de rustique inspiration montagne du Colorado et design.
;
positive;La salle du petit d\u00e9jeuner pourrait \u00eatre plus conviviale, un peu \u00e0 l'\u00e9troit \u00e0 cot\u00e9 du lobby de l'hotel.
;
positive;The hotel provides all you'd hope for from a top-rated establishment: friendly, helpful service, good sized immaculate rooms complete with amazingly comfortable beds, complimentary shoe-shine evening turn-down with chocolate and newspaper, designer toiletries, sumptuous robes ($120 to buy), lobby area etc etc.
;
positive;When we checked in, they didn't have the non-smoking suite we reserved but offered to discount a smoking suite at a substantial rate.
;
positive;"""I've stayed at this hotel several times.."
;
negative;The location was great just a short walk to Time Square and even closer to central park\nThe hotel has seen better days, the rooms are clean but very worn.
;
positive;\nWe didn\u2019t have any noise issues other than numerous people talking LOUDLY in the hallways after midnight (come on, people, a little consideration isn\u2019t asking that much, is it?).
;
negative;A very nice lady told me no problem, she would take care of everything for me, but my room would not be ready for another hour and gave me points of interest in the city and directions so we would have something to do while waiting(we was a couple hours early) After going out for dinner and returning, we found a different lady working the check in and she proceeded to tell me everything the first lady tole me was wrong.
;
positive;You pull up and are treated like royalty: door opened, help out of the car, took care of the bags and called you by the last name!
;
positive;I took my husband last December and had a great time.
;
negative;Especially the person who not ONLY charged us for the night, but charged us for the night we slept on an apartment floor.. Over drafting one in our groups account..
;
positive;The hotel is not far from the Red Line making it easy to get anywhere in Chicago quickly.
;
positive;"We were appreciated for your hospitality service standarts."""
;
positive;Rest assured I will be staying again and looking forward to it.
;
positive;We took advantage of the free shuttle to get around during NYE which was a life-saver.
;
positive;"""Great hotel near everything."
;
negative;\nHere's the thing - the people who work here could not be nicer.
;
positive;"dance club is nice and restaurant is awesome but the staff was no where to be found especially late at night."""
;
positive;Bathroom was spotless.
;
positive;The location is excellent.
;
positive;I think they keep it staffed fairly tightly - one or two people running it all, and they did a fantastic job at keeping the food and drink areas well stocked, rotated, and replenished.
;
negative;AND the room was clean!
;
positive;"""My husband and I spent a week at the Palmer House and were so pleased with our room and the employees we dealt with."
;
negative;The pool area was no better.
;
positive;"""I stayed at the Luxe Feb 14th-19th 2012 with 2 girlfriends for a wonderful girls trip."
;
positive;I would recommend this hotel to all my friends, family and business associates.
;
negative;There was not a soul in the lobby, and the place was HUGE, and they didn't have one single clean room to show us, and they didn't have a computer system that showed them which room was unoccupied????
;
positive;\nI have booked the Palomar in Washington DC for a christmas trip and had decided that depending on how things go in the Dallas Palomar, I may change my decision on Washington, but I will keep my reservation.
;
positive;I was on the verge of booking two seperate rooms in a budget hotel when I ran across Sommerset Suites.
;
positive;I was on the phone for 20 minutes trying to get a chair for the room.
;
negative;Maid kept knocking at our door as from 7:30 am onwards.
;
negative;"Not a great hotel to stay if you like your sleep."""
;
positive;"""Walter, Walter, Walter!"
;
positive;"The front desk has a small food/drink area, similar to other business suites now.\nWould definitely stay there again.."""
;
positive;The Regency isn't always affordable--I paid $331 per night plus taxes in May, but in October, when I'm back in New York, the rate jumps to $459.
;
positive;The lobby and bar are straight out of some movie (or a dream).
;
positive;"""Das Hotel hat die absolut richtige Lage f\u00fcr Shopping uns Sight seeing."
;
positive;"""Sadly, I was a guest for only one night at this lovely hotel."
;
negative;Your looking at around $12 a drink, which soon stacks up if you are thirsty & want more than a glass of ice.\nWe have stayed in NYC before & are aware that space is at a premium so I wasn't expecting a big room.
;
positive;The food was great!
;
positive;All corridors are clean.
;
positive;We were leery of trying somewhere new, but really needed to find a better rate.
;
positive;Also within a block are two drugstores (CVS, Walgreen's) that have inexpensive bottled water, snacks and even souvenirs.
;
negative;We have never stayed in a hotel as noisy as this before and paid $600 a night for the privilege as well!\nWe spoke to the hotel management who agreed that things have got a 'little out of hand' - but unless you're assured that the room you're considering is completely away from the clubbers and the associated noise and disturbance, then be aware!
;
positive;Starbucks in the foyer is a God-send for those who need a caffiene fix first thing in the AM ...
;
positive;While some people point out how small the rooftop pool is, I went instead for the great views from the rooftop.
;
positive;About a 10 minute cab ride from the Amtrak station.
;
negative;"I was told several times \""hold on a second\"" as Ms. Walkie Talkie barked a new piece of info ...\nNot quite a welcome."
;
positive;Take your own tea bags!
;
positive;Once we got back to the hotel after our evening out we went to the BIG BAR.
;
positive;We travel a great deal, and this room had to have been the smallest that we have ever stayed in...ever.
;
positive;But we didn't need a lot from them so it wasn't a big deal.
;
positive;Rooms were spotless.
;
positive;The staff were lovely and the rooms/ toilets very clean, warm and homely.
;
positive;"Its a bit more \""traditional\"" than the Ritz in Georgetown."
;
positive;Only suggestions to the hotel would be: Offer complimentary internet services.
;
positive;And the bed was comfy.
;
positive;We didn't book any transfers from the airport, we flew in to Newark as the reviews for these where very poor so we thought we would get a taxi when we got there, on arrival the taxi rank was packed so we opted for the train straight from the station the cost for 2 tickets was $25, and i have to say it was very easy to use and would do this again the next time we go, we then walked from Penn station NY to our hotel which took about 20 mins, after our 4 days of an amazing trip we booked a transfer back to the airport as our cases where a lot heavier going home, with the hotel reception the night before our departure, the cost of this was $80 and we could not believe it when a black limo arrived just for the 2 of us, it just finished our trip of in style.
;
positive;The Breakfast was a Hot Buffet style, Scrambled eggs, little sausages, breakfast potatoes, hot porridge (oatmeal) toast, french toast, cereals, juices, fruit, it done on a budget but it's really pretty good.
;
positive;"Very nice staff."""
;
positive;All, very little things.
;
positive;The location was perfect for walking to 5th Avenue Theater and for checking out the Seattle flower and garden show, which we found about it, from a sign that was advertising it in the lobby.
;
positive;free parking.
;
negative;The restaurant, bar and lobby are nice, but that is it.
;
negative;The lady told me that I can\u2019t cancel.
;
positive;They are refinishing/repairing the outside of the property and then they will do the lobby, ballrooms and restaurants, followed by the guest rooms.
;
positive;All the staff were amazingly friendly and happy to help us out in any way the could.
;
positive;For an older hotel I have no complaints.
;
positive;"""My husband and I just stayed for 2 nights at the Warwick Hotel SFO."
;
positive;We were within walking distance to practically everything, Macys was just around the corner!
;
positive;Rooms have been recently renovated.
;
positive;They replaced all of the furniture before we left and now have brand new couches, ottomans and chairs - all are the cushy sofa style.
;
positive;You won't find any amazing view here, but it is a 5 minute ride to the airoprt (taxi $16) and a two minute walk to the trolley that takes you to Gaslamp/Downtown, etc.
;
positive;It was clean and had a very comfortable bed.
;
positive;"\nWill come back again!"""
;
positive;A GPS was essential, and will still benefited from printing off a mapquest street map because it's hard to envision that I-295 heading north dumped right onto Russell Street.
;
positive;"""I stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria for two nights this August."
;
positive;I guess Wes and staff really wanted to make us feel at home but I must say it was a little freaky!
;
negative;The location is great across from Fanueil Hall and close to the North End.
;
positive;Wanted to stay one more day but the price doubled so we had to check out.
;
positive;I would even bring my family back.
;
positive;I was surprised that this room was even available given that the room across from me was partially demolished, the lower half of the walls in the hallway had drywall removed, with exposed studs, and the carpet in the hall and up to my door was covered with cardboard duct-taped to the walls and threshold.
;
positive;Perfect for our stay.
;
positive;There was an array of greenery growing everywhere.
;
positive;Oh well, just take a couple of Aleves each day.
;
negative;They were in no hurry to help anyone.
;
positive;\n My lasting impression of the hotel is one of relaxation, comfort, and being well-cared for in a great hotel by warm and professional people.
;
positive;The 9th floor bar opens at 5:00pm (it has very cool smokeless fire pits) but during the day you can sit and enjoy the sunshine.\nOur room was super clean and very quiet.
;
positive;We got one of the closest rooms to 101 (no other rooms were available) and it was NOISY.
;
positive;We fell in love!
;
positive;Staff was unfailingly helpful, polite, professional and welcoming.
;
positive;A studio, jr suite, etc.
;
positive;I found the lighting to be a bit poor in the bathroom, but sufficient enough.
;
negative;I don\u2019t know what they put it in but it was addictive.
;
positive;"Entering the hotel from the parking lot also creates a bit of an odd experience as I often found myself entering through the pool or through one of the convention halls rather than the front lobby.\nThe elevators were being updated with a \""new look\"" during my stay, and while they did have a sign up warning that they were doing work, it seemed that multiple cars had been taken out of service at the same time so that delays were often quite long."
;
positive;"Would recommend to everyone to stay here"""
;
negative;The freezer smelled.
;
negative;"""Sous des apparences de \""grand hotel\"" c'est un hotel assez vieillot."
;
positive;\nThe room was beautiful, great views and literally right in the middle of everything - just a half block down from Michigan Ave. Saks was just a few steps away and plenty of great places to eat and shop.
;
positive;"""I stayed here during a business trip that was booked through a travel agent."
;
positive;The room was very clean, the mattresses looked virtually new and the bedding was very nice.
;
positive;Es war kein Staub sondern Putz und M\u00f6rtel der in den Ritzen der Klimaanlage klemmte.
;
positive;The location was perfect, just few blocks away from Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center and Times Square, easy walking distance to everything.
;
positive;"Overall the hotel was great, and we would definitely stay here again."""
;
negative;Also both mornings our breakfast selections in EVERY room was messed up 1 way or another.
;
positive;Bathroom was spacious enough for two, towels/washcloths were good quality, mini lotion/shampoo/conditioner provided.
;
positive;The hotel staff was very helpful, informative and pleasant at all times.
;
positive;Room got noisy at 5am from inside the hotel.
;
positive;Restaurant food was simple and better than most hotel restaurants.
;
positive;"I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple and centrally located hotel, and doesn\u2019t want to break the bank to stay there."""
;
positive;The room was equipped with a safe, two large flat screens and an ipod charger/dock.
;
negative;The hotel is located a block or block and a half away from Pier 39 where there are a lot of touristy restaurants (do not eat at the outdoor stalls).
;
positive;A sign did mention that the public areas had WiFi but I never tested that out.\nI asked for a glass of house white wine and was then presented with a bill for $14.
;
negative;We tried to find another hotel but no luck.
;
negative;The room was smelly and had mucus on the bedside table.
;
positive;"""Der Eingang ist sicherlich nicht pr\u00e4tenti\u00f6s (erliegt direkt an der Stadtautobahn nach S\u00fcden), aber sobald sich die T\u00fcr \u00f6ffnet, herrscht der bekannt gute Komfort des Hotels vor."
;
positive;Check in was a breeze.
;
positive;We spent our last of three nights there in the on site restaurant, Perrys, watching the Superbowl.
;
negative;"This place cost me more money than my return flight; I should have just slept on the street."""
;
positive;After discovering our mystery hotel, we looked up the reviews on Trip Advisor, and had some concerns...
;
positive;"Noticed some airline personnel staying here."""
;
positive;\nThe staff were friendly and helpful with directions and advice.
;
positive;"""My friends and I have just returned from NYC where we had the most amazing hol, fab time!"
;
positive;That was for sandwiches and one beer each.
;
negative;"Very central location, but also very hard to get to and from due to the traffic because it is such a tourist spot."""
;
positive;My first thought was someone was over zealous cleaning and scrubbed off the top coat.
;
negative;We complained and asked if we could change rooms/hotels something so we would have what we needed.
;
positive;I particularly enjoyed the spa-like bath, huge LCD television and the room was only 1-month old (new tower).
;
positive;La collocazione sulla Nob Hill \u00e8 ottima per le visite alla citt\u00e0: a due passi c'\u00e8 il cable car per Union Square da un lato e Chinatown e la zona dei moli dall'altro.
;
positive;"All in all a fantastic little hotel that makes it easy to reach pretty much anywhere in D.C."""
;
positive;"She's a pro, accomodating on our request for a river-view room & informed us of the \""free\"" Priorty Club cocktail event from 5:30 to 7:30 pm which we attended & enjoyed wine & snacks & met many of the Plaza management staff.\n Room nicely appointed...But the \""best..Ah-h the bed with all those down pillows Most comfy bed , total comfort with lavender linen spray,eye shades & earplugs."
;
negative;The wallpaper wasn't peeling off in either of the rooms we had and the bathrooms were fairly clean.
;
positive;Less than a mile, but in a quiet area.
;
positive;Although some others have complained about the breakfast, it worked perfectly for me - the chance to grab a couple of croissants (of different types and good quality) on the way out the door is what I want when I'm in town for business.
;
positive;I don't really think much can be done about this, just be prepared.
;
positive;Het comfort is daarbij niet vergeten.
;
negative;This was a business trip.
;
negative;"""My husband and I recently spent a night at the mansion to celebrate our nine year wedding anniversary."
;
positive;"""I like this place."
;
positive;The hallway lighting is a bit darker than I would have liked but the room brightness more than made it up.\nThe room is clean, airy and new.
;
positive;The decor is lovely.
;
positive;From the comfort and spaciousness of our room (a junior suite) to every interaction with hotel personnel, we were extremely pleased.
;
positive;Blocks away from literally EVERYTHING we went to see and do !!!!
;
positive;A plus is being close to Little Italy where we had a delicous meal our second night.
;
positive;"""My 2 older children and I had a reunion at the Lenox Hotel and stayed there for 4 nights."
;
positive;"We had the windows opened the whole 4 nights we stayed and were comfortable; it got down to 22F degrees one night."
;
negative;Our room was supposed to be cleaned weekly but it usually only happened after I went to the manager and complained.
;
positive;The bar staff were extremely professional.
;
positive;There was plenty of parking and also valet parking which was more expensive.
;
positive;"""I have never reviewed a hotel before."
;
negative;We had a large party so we rented 3 rooms, I didn't get to jsut see one DUMP.\nMy first impression wasn't so bad.
;
positive;The bed was really comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well.
;
positive;"into a movie it shuts off and i end up paying for a movie that i didnt get to watch.. this has happened 4 times in 3 months,"""
;
positive;I think the Vagabond IS a business hotel, so I guess it's supposed to be a little spartan.
;
positive;We had a 2 bed studio on the 12th floor.
;
positive;Also, it is located one block from the 16th street mall.
;
positive;"""Wir waren das erste mal in New York und das Hotel war unserer Meinung nach super und das Preis Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis war ausgezeichnet."
;
positive;Staff was extremely helpful, friendly and professional.
;
positive;"Typical RI breakfast."""
;
positive;Really great.
;
positive;The room was beautiful (although a bit dark), spacious, great design and style.
;
positive;"""Spent 4 nights here."
;
positive;Great for shopping and dining.
;
positive;We often caught the Dash bus from around the corner out the front of the Petrol station for 25c up to Hollywood and Highland.
;
positive;Would definitely stay here again.
;
negative;"""I flew from Seattle to spend two nights in LA, both at the Hotel Angeleno."
;
positive;"""Stayed at the Strattford for 5 nights for a convention, and very satisfied for the price we paid ($80)."
;
positive;The hotel was very clean.
;
positive;The staff is very friendly and helpful.\nI have stayed in a number of Reisdence Inns when I travel for business and enjoy the evening happy hour.
;
positive;"""My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend get-a-way."
;
negative;They also promised to add 5000 Starwood points to my account.
;
negative;The plugs around the floor outlets were bare and the carpet looked like it needed to be cleaned badly.
;
positive;Nice lounge for drinks and wonderful buffet breakfast on Thanksgiving morning as they were closed the remainder of that day.
;
negative;"The \""business center\"" is actually a small table with a computer on it."
;
positive;"""The hotel was great."
;
positive;"""Abbiamo soggiornato ad agosto in questo hotel, comodissimo come posizione."
;
positive;\nThe room was huge with a pristine bathroom and was actually two rooms with one containing two beds and one containing a sofa bed and this when made into a bed was a perfectly comfortable bed.
;
positive;"If you've never been to Austin before, you won\u2019t be sorry you picked this hotel, the location and staff is top notch."""
;
positive;I wish they would have taken extra notice and saw that we would of coarse needed more syrup.
;
positive;"""Abbiamo soggiornato 4 notti in questo albergo."
;
positive;Quartier tranquille.
;
positive;"They accomodated all my needs, gave directions to area events, and assisted in resturant selections."""
;
positive;"""This is a decent hotel, and was actually better than I expected."
;
positive;Yes, there is a Ruth Chris steakhouse but Ruth Chris' for breakfast or just a place to sit in the afternoon for a drink does not suffice.
;
positive;"""We recently traveled to Chicago for a business trip and really enjoyed the city and the hotel."
;
positive;"I would stay there again since when your visting New York you don't spend much time in you room anyway."""
;
negative;"That attitude clearly demonstrates a lack of respect for the client and a lack of respect for our business."""
;
positive;\nWe ate in Solas the Irish bar and this was pretty good and cocktails in the city bar were great also.
;
negative;"""Do not stay at this Holiday Inn!"
;
positive;La prima colazione \u00e8 un vero piacere: se non fa freddo puoi consumarla nel piccolo giardino, che \u00e8 la chicca di questohotel, oppure nella veranda o vicino al bancone cuina dove sono allineati una Nespresso (uhau!
;
positive;2) SPACIOUS rooms... we were never bumping into each other, or tripping over bags.
;
positive;"The minibar was stocked with lots of different options for alcohol & non-alcoholic drinks (bottles were not \""mini\"" sized either) and snacks."
;
positive;although the hotel is older, the grounds are lovely and the location is great.
;
positive;"""we got a great deal through Hotwire for Texas/ou weekend."
;
positive;They were all a short drive from the hotel.
;
positive;The hotel is conveniently located at the intersection of I-69 & I-465.
;
positive;Jerry gave suggestions about sights that we should visit and how to get there.
;
negative;We prepaid and our credit card was charged.
;
negative;It seemed like an inconvenience to ask.\nThe carpet was in really bad condition.
;
negative;They were smokers so we didn't use it much.
;
positive;Not much view.
;
positive;The room was very nice with a beautiful view Michigan Ave and the river.
;
positive;"It was nice to have a balcony and convenient parking."""
;
positive;Very clean!!!!!
;
positive;While this hotel was clean and affordable, the rooms were extremely small, to the point of being uncomfortable for two persons to move around in.
;
positive;The room is smaller, but efficiently used.
;
positive;Yes, it was a half block in the wrong direction, but that was manageable because otherwise the location was fantastic.
;
positive;"I was running late for my flight and Nabela personally went outside in the rain to hail me a taxi.\nI am one who travels very much and this would probably not have been a hotel I would have returned to due to the construction noise but service like this is what I look forward to when away from home.\nTHANK YOU GUYS!"""
;
positive;(ainsi nous avions demand\u00e9 2 chambres contigu\u00ebs pour \u00eatre \u00e0 cot\u00e9 de nos enfants et il a fallu batailler pour avoir des chambres au m\u00eame \u00e9tage !
;
positive;The property has the Embassy open atrium and the lobby at the bottom, but happy hour presented a nice selection of beers and mixed drinks (the margarita and sangria made in-house were especially tasty) and breakfast was fantastic, as well.
;
positive;"Not a good way to greet and treat paying customers."""
;
positive;Cependant, notre chambre, situ\u00e9e au 6\u00e8me c\u00f4t\u00e9 cour int\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s calme (attention cependant : des travaux sur l'immeuble voisin peuvent cr\u00e9er quelques nuisances sonores \u00e0 partir de 8h00 du matin).
;
positive;Everything was functional and comfortable.
;
positive;The hotel was nicely furnished, modern interior with spacious rooms and friendly staff too.
;
positive;"A parte questo piccolo neo per il resto \u00e8 stato all'altezza delle nostre aspettative... Nn per il prezzo che \u00e8 esageratamente alto la del resto come in tutti glia otri alberghi di ny."""
;
positive;Bed was very cozy.
;
positive;"Made to order breakfast, tea and cookies and candies available all day long, sandwiches mid-afternoon, adult beverages from 4-10pm with a \""taste\"" from one of the restaurants at 5 and desert at 8."
;
negative;The manager response to that was ''This is New York, there will be rats'' Toilet constantly gets blocked, their response was ''it's the forth floor it happens when it's so high up'' (Well i have stayed in hotels 10 floors and more high, never had that problem.)
;
positive;The living area was very roomy and we had a view of the Capitol Building.
;
positive;Checked in easily and asked for high room (after reading warnings about views/noisy exterior air conditioning fans).
;
positive;I reccommend reserving the private area--they served us with fresh fruit and vegetables, and we spent the day in our own private wood spa filled with flowers.
;
positive;"Will definitely return and recommend to others!"""
;
negative;\nCustomer service was okay.
;
negative;"""We booked a basic room for 2 - turned out to be a 2x2 cell block!!"
;
positive;Check out was very easy in the morning, and we were able to leave our car in the ramp until 6pm so we could see more of the city.
;
positive;Our very clean room and bathroom were more spacious than we expected.
;
positive;The moment you enter the hotel the staff greats you with a smile and makes sure that they get you to your room quickily.\nThe hotel is simple modern very clean lines and the rooms are spacious very large windows that let the light in and the windows open a great plus in NY.\nThe bathroom was great with a rain shower.
;
positive;I will spare you the gory details because I really don\u2019t feel like reliving the only bad part of the trip but don\u2019t use this company.
;
positive;Sparkling wine or champagne would be the standard fare, we were told.
;
positive;It sounded like the heat vent in the bathroom was connected to another room's system because it was on when our heat was off but the vent was closed off.
;
positive;"In particular, Jill and Empress who hosted a nightly \""Crabby Hour\"" with local beers and wine and demonstrated how to make crab crepes."
;
positive;"La hall e'bellissima..."""
;
positive;We had booked a Deluxe and were upgraded to a Superior, I assume because we are part of the Select Guest program.
;
positive;The lobby was very beautifully decorated, the room was beautiful, clean and the heating unit worked perfectly.
;
positive;This was attended by a lot of people and everyone just chatted and shared their Chicago experience.
;
positive;I know they will not let us down.
;
positive;It was myself, my husband, and daughter.
;
positive;"""Tr\u00e8s bon h\u00f4tel."
;
positive;My room was ready in the afternoon and was on the 52nd floor!
;
positive;the room service, eggs benni in the moring and i fall back asleep in bed.
;
positive;Yes, there was some traffic noise and much merriment coming from the 4040 Club on Saturday night/Sunday morning, but not enough to make having a room at the front of the hotel a problem.
;
positive;It has a good location, only 10 mins walk from the magnificent mile.
;
positive;"But for an event at the convention center, it's just fine."""
;
negative;"I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!"""
;
negative;But it left quite an impression on me.
;
positive;For the Boston area it is a very economic option and a very nice hotel.
;
negative;Those will end up on a pile of your things, whether they be your clean clothes, dirty clothes, shoes, laptop.
;
positive;We started each day with a full stomach!
;
positive;The elevators were quick and the location is excellent but not quite so busy as Times Square.
;
negative;It is just a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Ed Sullivan Theatre, Broadway theatres, and Carnegie Hall.
;
positive;Loved getting a fresh breakfast and coming home to a nice dinner (complete with salad).
;
positive;"""Stayed here with my wife and 15 month old daughter."
;
negative;Even with my multiple trips to the front desk the same clerk always seemed surprised that I was a guest.\nFinally the counter in the bathroom extended too far over the toilet and impeded the toilet seat lid from fully opening.
;
positive;HOWEVER, we soon found that we could walk along the downtown streets of SA (on the sidewalks) and then get back on the RWalk and were quickly back in the action.
;
positive;"""Too many New York hotels are legendary for having (a) rooms the size of postage stamps, (b) a surround-sound of constant noise, (c) web sites that bear no resemblance to their reality, and (d) prices far higher than the actual level of your experience."
;
positive;"""All of the reviews of this place had me second-guessing my stay at this hotel."
;
positive;"\nWould definately return!!"""
;
positive;Great location, typical business class hotel with usual amenities, room in very good condition, staff very helpful.
;
positive;\nI want to put in a special recognition to Mr. Cronin the GM and Mr. Caballero the senior operations manager.
;
positive;In fact, we had a separate his and her bathroom!
;
negative;"""The place consist of two parts: hotel and hostel."
;
negative;It's loaded with so much crap it's like starting a PC in 2000.
;
negative;My co-workers and I stayed at the Hotel St. Regis in Detroit for a business trip and received less than desirable service during our stay.
;
positive;The only pitfall was that the fitness center was small and the treadmill was not working properly.
;
positive;"(The beds are very comfy, so we went right back to sleep!)"""
;
positive;Absoutely worth the small upgrade fee!
;
positive;"""I had a great stay at the Royalton."
;
negative;We don't mind paying a little more for the room if we are guaranteed a view of Times Square (which we were given every time we stayed).
;
negative;"I am not all that modest, and don't mind nude/sexual paintings so I wasn't offended, but people traveling with kids might want to be aware."""
;
positive;"""thank you, i slept well, very comfortable, nice rooms."
;
positive;Nice view of Avenue of the Arts also, aka Broad St.
;
positive;It just happened every downtown hotel was booked and they were the only one who had a rooms left.
;
positive;I am not sure I would pay upwards of $350 a night to stay here.
;
positive;There's a tremendous police presence for good reason.
;
positive;"""great hotel, friendly and helpful staff, bed has to be one of the most comfortable i have slept on plus it was huge!"
;
negative;Seems to me they should have seen that I was going to be there all week would need to hang some clothing.
;
positive;All of the rooms were bungalows which provided for a much quiter and relaxing stay.
;
positive;This was the beginning of our honeymoon, so we were willing to pay the extra $100+ (room rate and parking) for the convenience.
;
positive;"You will find plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate\narea and not all at typical NY prices.The best thing about this hotel is the area , quality of rooms and accessabilty to the rest of Manhattan.Good value!"""
;
negative;I have stayed in much nicer hostels.
;
negative;"It was simply one of the most terrible hotel experience I've had in a long time!"""
;
positive;The beds were extremely comfortable and had a pillow-top type mattress.
;
positive;First night we had noisy neighbors, but thankfully they only stayed for one night.
;
positive;I heard a lot of negative comments about the reception staff but in general they were very helpful.
;
positive;But for business travel, traveling couples, or older children it was just fine.\nAlso, I had read on these reviews that parking was valet only (confirmed that) and was ~$35/day.
;
negative;Less than 5 miles from the border from where we are.\nI hope this can help some of you fellow travellers.
;
positive;He wanted me to sign some form that says he's not responsible for anything that happens to my car.
;
positive;"Welcoming, helpful and professional."""
;
negative;It would be one thing if they were not allowing anyone in but I watched them allow 10-20 class acts (males) decked out in their Ed Hardy up top.
;
positive;I would definately stay at this hotel again.
;
negative;Caro para o valor que cobram.
;
negative;Staff at the lobby bar tried very hard to be nice, but being nice it not enough if you do not have the skills to work in a bar.
;
positive;The busboys and front desk staff were helpful and attentive.
;
positive;"""The Wingate by Wyndham provides a great location at very reasonable prices."
;
positive;The location couldn't have been better, stones throw from pier 39.
;
positive;This should really be standard IMO.\n-There was no continental breakfast as advertised...just lukewarm coffee\n-TV had fuzzy reception\n-There was apparently a group of men living in the same building we stayed in who kept their doors open as if they were living in a dorm room.
;
positive;We checked in a few hours early with no problems.\nI will stay here again as we like to fly down for the weekend and go to the Giants games.
;
positive;There was also a couple tasty French pastries and high end bottled water.
;
negative;A woman we spoke to later, whose name I didn't get, also needed to see ID but didn't seem to care that it was in my wallet.\nWe went to drop off our bags since we were going out for the afternoon and the room wasn't ready, and were told we had to pay to have them held, though we were guests at the hotel.
;
positive;Early Saturday morning I called and asked the folks at Balboa Park Inn if they would be kind enough to let us cancel the first 3 nights of our 4 night stay (spent the rest of the trip in Anaheim) - something they didn't have to do based on their cancellation policy.
;
positive;"Good Job!!!!!"""
;
positive;"""Alles was keurig geregeld en het personeel was erg vriendelijk en service gericht."
;
positive;From the time we checked in till the time we checked out!
;
positive;"""We were on the 24th floor, in a \""premium view\"" room, with a stunning view of the Hudson river a couple of picturesque blocks away."
;
positive;Tutte le mattine viene consegnata gratuitamente una copia del New York Times che ha la sede a due passi.
;
positive;"There are several \""booths\"" where one can access the internet 24-7 but this is charged to your credit card at 50 cents a minute."
;
positive;"Das Hallenbad in der obersten Etage hat jedoch seine Glanzzeiten hinter sich, jedoch auch hier alles sauber."""
;
positive;We took a red-eye and we were really tired when we arrived at 9 am at the hotel.
;
positive;We had a great time and I would definitely consider staying again.
;
positive;"The chef preparing the omelettes was very personable and made sure your order was correct."""
;
positive;The hotel is huge there are two towers.
;
positive;"""Our pre-cruise stay at the Residence Inn was all we had hoped for & more."
;
positive;The bathroom was big and spotless.
;
positive;The hotel is wonderful but Randy made it GREAT!
;
negative;"The pet rate was higher than we were told when booking.\nThe room/bed/bathroom were about average for the price level."""
;
positive;I almost hated asking them for help because their persistence in satisfying my personal requests at times must have taken valuable time from other duties!!
;
positive;"""I had an excellent time at this hotel, it was actually my second stay there and now the only place I will stay when vising in LA which I travel to apprx 4 times a year on business.\nThe service is excellent, the staff are extremely helpful and lovely."
;
positive;people at the front desk where always friendly and helpful.
;
positive;It's not just a museum, it's also the winding room providing the power for the whole system.
;
positive;A little steep for Columbus in my opinion.
;
positive;The location is close enough to downtown clubs areas (6th, warehouse) but not too close.
;
positive;I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend it to my family and friends.
;
negative;160 for a bed and 3 bars of soap.
;
negative;Well when we checked in we were put on the 26th floor and was told that they had switched towers for the club level because it the original tower was being remodeled.
;
positive;Tick again\nColin, the manager, is mist obliging and full of suggestions for things to do and what's on.
;
positive;Fica ao lado da rodovia 85 o que facilita o deslocamento pela cidade para que est\u00e1 com carro.
;
negative;It wasn't.
;
positive;We loved the framed black and white photographs on the walls of famous people who had styed at The Waldorf it just added to the glamourous feel of the place.
;
negative;The first room that they booked for us was unacceptable so they were very nice and changed our room to the renovated tower.
;
negative;Nice properties.
;
positive;I'm not saying it's not worth paying more, but I would have to see what else is out there.
;
positive;I have stayed in ALOT of Holiday Inns and this is one of the nicest Ive seen.
;
positive;"Everything was expensive, but this is Santana Row..."""
;
positive;Das Hotel macht zwar einen sehr formalen Eindruck.
;
negative;"My husband and I, should we choose, were welcome to sit in a garage that had been \""converted\"" into a \""porch.\"" Well, since it was after all only a garage with two chairs in it and the weather was freezing we passed on this."
;
negative;I immediately called La Quinta and spoke to the desk clerk who was too busy to check and advised me to call later.
;
positive;The room size was brilliant for a central NYC hotel.
;
positive;The hotel has obviously been recently refurbished and they have done a good job.
;
negative;The butler idea is pretentious and useless.
;
positive;The lobby is small but quite adequate and clean.\nUpon entering our room, king-size bed, we were further pleased.
;
positive;In fact, it was the coldest we have ever had!\nThere is plenty of food within a short walk of the hotel, as well as a CVS pharmacy basically right next door.
;
negative;Upon arrival, I asked for the microwave - They said they had NONE available for the rooms.
;
positive;There was a nice flatscreen tv in the room and a safe big enough to hold a laptop.
;
positive;We could see out across Union Square and watched people eating at The Cheesecake Factory located on top of Macy's.
;
positive;My room was pretty small, but I wasn't there to hang out in the room so it was fine.
;
positive;I think we've all crossed the threshold into free wifi... come on, if Days Inn can do it, so can you Handlery.\nThe Union Square area is more of a New York vibe - the good and the bad sides.
;
positive;"I would strongly recommend it to other travelers."""
;
positive;Subway a 30 metri, personale cordiale, camere un p\u00f2 piccole ma pulite, cambio asciugamani quotidiano, prima colazione (varia ed abbondante) inclusa, wifi gratuito in tutta la struttura, posizione abbastanza centrale, rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo molto onesto.
;
positive;We didn't have any tea or coffee making facilities in our room so we asked at the front desk and found a hotwater machine, tea and coffee waiting for us outside our room when we returned.
;
negative;When I stepped off of it, there were black streaks.
;
negative;Also, they should take the time to make a flyer and put it under the door.
;
positive;We had a room that was not facing the street and it was very quiet.
;
positive;Breakfast was good, the only downfall was that it was very crowded- I would advise going early.
;
negative;"The water park was a joke; half the slides were not working."
;
positive;"""My husband and I stayed at the Casablanca for 3 nights at the beginning of August."
;
positive;You want a very different hotel experience in NYC and the Yotel certainly does that.
;
positive;Most of Broadway falls into that area, so if you're visiting NYC briefly and doing mostly tourist-y things, this location would be great.\nThe only negatives from my stay were:\n- The elevator (mentioned by many) which didn't appear when I was trying to leave and resulted in a walk up to the sixth floor to collect luggage (thankfully the elevator did show up before we had to carry both my 50lb bags down!)
;
positive;We attended a Sunday service at the National Cathedral (a 30 minute uphill walk from hotel), which I highly recommend, regardless of which faith you are or aren't (we dressed up, but there were several people in jeans/shorts).
;
positive;The room was a good size, had a HUGE window overlooking the Highline and the Empire State Building.
;
positive;The hotel provides free Internet access to print boarding passes.
;
positive;Rooms are very nice, a little small, but nicely appointed.
;
positive;"Parking is HORRIBLY EXPENSIVE!"""
;
positive;"this hotel is a couple of blocks from the metro and its the red line -- not the most convenient for tourist stuff.\nthe food was the normal residence inn stuff -- 'love those high fat made to order waffles for breakfast, and the pulled pork on a warm roll for dinner was just fine."""
;
positive;There is also a DVD player and clock radio with Ipod hookup.
;
positive;"""The hotel is not the Hyatt, but I found the service to be excellent."
;
positive;"I would certainly return."""
;
positive;"The fruit, vegetables, food was so fresh - was the real deal - brought back a bunch of snacks for the room.\nWill definitely be back to the Stanford Court for next trips to San Francisco!"""
;
positive;"Les chambres sont spacieuses, modernes et le lit un des meilleurs surlequel j'ai pu dormir.\nTout est r\u00e9uni pour faire de ce s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Chicago, un agr\u00e9able moment.\nNous retournerons \u00e0 Chicago et au Sofitel sans aucun doute."""
;
positive;Upon arrival there weren't any studio rooms available, so he instantly upgraded me without flinching.
;
positive;I attended a conference in the Hilton and had breakfast over there for the rest of the week.
;
positive;There are three of them, but you do have to be patient if you are trying to go somewhere at these peak times.
;
positive;We wanted to put the bed in our suitacases to take home!!!!!
;
positive;The breakfast bar had madetr to order omlettes and the atrium provided a wonderful view.
;
positive;"""We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April, 2003."
;
positive;The bathroom layout was a little different (actually two separate rooms, one w/ a sink & shower and one with a toilet and sink) but I liked it(reminded me of the Disney cruise bathroom layouts) and if you are traveling with other people I think it would be an added benefit since there are two sinks, places to get ready.\nThe gym area was basic but clean.
;
positive;Pedi uma vez e o atendente disse que entregaria em 30 minutos.
;
positive;Very good service.
;
positive;Strange.
;
positive;Our room had a refrigerator ,microwave and two queen beds.
;
positive;Maybe we will see you there!
;
positive;"Would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again."""
;
positive;Staff very pleasant at all times.
;
positive;good room service.
;
positive;It's down the street from financial district so that area can be quiet during the weekends.
;
positive;Very great staff!\nThere is also an exercise room, again a typical hotel gym, nothing huge, treadmill, weights, bike, elliptical, and a TV.
;
positive;"""Talking about a New York hotel, the east Houston is definitely a great hotel, naturally you will get more value for money in Oregon :-), but the East Houston offers fine clean rooms in a great area, friendly staff, breakfast for free, super roof terrace with possibility of enjoying the breakfast with a skyline view."
;
positive;Booked early so i got a good rate and the hotel was really nice.
;
negative;\nNos dieron una habitaci\u00f3n en la planta 12 con vistas al teatro chino.
;
positive;Great hotel for, great price.
;
positive;Any wonder why so many people in this country are overweight?
;
positive;"\""Brians\"" next door does excellant food 24 hours per day."
;
positive;"Would come back again!"""
;
positive;"I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it highly."""
;
positive;Das Stockwerk war uns recht egal, wir wollten ja nur ein ruhiges Zimmer, aber die Aussicht war traumhaft.
;
positive;The rooms were great, even if the view was typical of New York - facing another nearby building.
;
negative;Wir waren zu zweit (alter 25 Jahre).\nDie Lage des Hotels ist super.
;
positive;They took the time to listen to my numerous queries, even when I was changing our reservations for the second time.\nThe evening we checked in there was a pianist playing the piano, doormen attentive to the guests checking in and check in was done quickly as well.\nWe had taken 2 rooms and both the rooms were clean, spacious compared to Manhattan standards, clean and very comfortable beds with modern decor and massaging shower heads.\nGood view if you are lucky enough to get rooms which face the city or waterside.\nLovely short walk to Central Park and the musuem, reasonble taxi fare to Times Square.\nGetting the package with parking included was worth it!\nOur family totally loved our stay at the hotel for its comfortable beds, cleanliness, decor and the hospitality was great!
;
positive;My experience with staff members, Monica C., Stephani and Nathan was pleasurable.
;
positive;"""This Hotel is Beautiful from the time you drive/walk up to it until the time you leave (Sadly!"
;
positive;!\nLa cosa pi\u00f9 importante di questo hotel \u00e8 la posizione, \u00e8 davvero a 200 metri nemmeno, da Time Square e dalla stazione Penn Station.
;
positive;We terribly needed a shower after our 20hr flight, hence US$10 seemed reasonable.\nThe location is so central that you can walk everywhere!
;
negative;Since when is each room individually controlled 'from the roof'?
;
positive;For the first time in a long time of staying in hotels, we didn't leave a tip for the maids.
;
positive;Overall the room was a good size for a city hotel and included all the usual amenities you would expect.
;
positive;Very clean.
;
positive;There\u2019s a small store for necessities in the lobby and the hotel is connected to the large Pfahl Conference Center, which has a nice restaurant on the first floor.
;
positive;They are trained to go that extra mile and they do!
;
positive;"""OMG, what a pleasure!"
;
positive;"Parking is not too expensive and you get your own car so its not a big deal any time you want to leave."""
;
positive;Best food deal is at Shaws down the road.
;
positive;No view, but this didn't bother us as we weren't in the room for any great length of time during the day.
;
positive;I simply love this hotel.
;
positive;"The only criticism is that there is no bar in the hotel but saying that there are plenty of bars to be found nearby."""
;
positive;The air conditioner was a bit noisy but didn\u2019t keep any of us awake at night.
;
positive;The rooms were stunning and we had a lovely view of the Space Needle.
;
positive;"""We just discovered this hotel and can not wait to return."
;
positive;The staff were very friendly and helpful.
;
positive;"They do a great job!"""
;
positive;"Sehr zu empfehlen, besonders wenn man sich ein Spiel in den Umliegenden Stadien angucken m\u00f6chte :)."""
;
positive;\nThe location I thought was amazing.
;
positive;The art is excellent, and the service is exceptional.
;
negative;Room was so small that you cant even turn around.
;
positive;"""The hotel was beautiful, and comfortable."
;
positive;The breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of items.
;
negative;"Da n\u00fctzt es auch nichts, dass die recht engen Zimmer sauber und nett eingerichtet sind!\nIch w\u00fcrde hier nicht noch einmal wohnen, selbst wenn es umsonst w\u00e4re !"""
;
positive;\nHotel staff were very welcoming and friendly and were always on hand to offer advice on exploring New York.
;
negative;The toilet had toilet paper in it, the bathroom floor was filthy, the bed sheets had not been changed (small hairs near pillows), and the shower stall was disgusting!
;
positive;"""We stayed here for 6 days and we had no problem at all!"
;
positive;For a reasonable cost increase, we were offered a significantly improved room (a suite in fact) on the same floor with a fantastic view.
;
positive;"\nI was pleased with my experience and would definitely return."""
;
positive;There's a convenient drug store about a block away.
;
positive;We got the City View rather than the sea view, but from the 11th floor the city looked great.
;
positive;Nice bedrooms and bathrooms and the staff were very helpfull and pleasant.
;
positive;I usually travel with cleaning supplies (yes I am a little neurotic), but I forgot them and I was okay with that!
;
positive;"I really can't wait to come back!"""
;
positive;"Overall, we had a great experience with this Hyatt and will definitely stay there again!!!"""
;
negative;They will tell you the shuttle runs every 30 minutes, that is if you are going to the airport, not if you meed their services for another venue.
;
positive;We came here after and it was rather refreshing.
;
positive;Wonderfully large bathroom.
;
positive;"""This has been our standby hotel when going to SF and loved that it had been redone recently."
;
negative;Cops patrol the outside constantly, which is not comforting.
;
positive;\nI prefer a different location on the west side or lower manhattan, but this HOTEL is fantastic.\nI booked the least expensive room thru the online discounter,Quikbook,, for myself and my daughter for 2 nights.
;
positive;"""Myself and my girlfiend stayed at Southgate Tower 14th till 21st dec. We found the hotel in an ideal location, central for everywhere."
;
positive;We had no problems celebrating my birthday with a few friends from NYC in the room before heading out.
;
positive;"La colazione decisamente scarsa e sottotono."""
;
positive;Nothing if you are looking to get a nap, however.
;
negative;"""Upon booking online, we put in a request that all down bedding be removed from the room due to an allergy."
;
negative;No ambience, elevator music blaring, and I was sick all night from some sort of food poisoning.
;
positive;"Nella peggiore delle ipotesi se nn si vuol usare la metro dopo le 10 di sera, si prende un taxi visti i costi irrisori!Le camere sono spaziosissime, ben organizzate, bagno confortevole e dotato di pulizia giornaliera con cambio degli asciugamani!La colazione ricca, non del tutto continentale come scrivono, ma indubbiamente sufficiente per affrontare una giornata all'insegna delle lunghe camminate!\nLo consiglierei davvero a chiunque perch\u00e8 per noi \u00e8 stato un buon punto di partenza arrivate a NY.!!"""
;
positive;Another thing that was helpful is that the hotel staff accommodated my early check-in so I didn't have to drag my luggage with me everywhere I went.
;
negative;"a/c is either too hot or too cold; doesn't automatically shut off\n3."
;
positive;"""The hotel is quite pricey, but deserves its 5-star rating."
;
negative;have stayed at beautiful 4 and 5 star hotels that don't nickel and dime you and have a real committment to service.
;
positive;\nRoom is a bit tiny but is well furnished.
;
positive;Afterwards we checked out the Little Italy Mercato/Farmer's Market just a few blocks down the street.
;
positive;Contrary to one review, the rooms do have drawers to put your clothes in!
;
positive;I'll admit I am picky with pillows.
;
negative;the bathroom tile floor had dirt tracks from shoes prints and a soap bar wrapper was in the corner.
;
positive;We are here for 8 days doing a trade show, so the beds were a treat after a grueling long days.
;
positive;"I will say the spa was not the greatest - and there are plenty of other spas in Dallas to choose from."""
;
positive;The front desk staff was courteous, helpful and provided maps and direction throughout our stay.\nThe lobby is small, but adequate.
;
positive;The closet had fluffy robes to use.
;
positive;"""This was my first stay at the Conrad."
;
positive;The room and hotel was very clean and up to date.
;
positive;Not only do you get exceptional service \nIt is consistent every time I go back!
;
negative;"There is a reason for the specials they run, it's not worth more!\nEnough said, go to priceline and for $120 you'll stay at the Westin (amazing place!!)"""
;
positive;There was a breakfast spread that included smoked salmon, pastries, bagels, fresh fruit and more.
;
positive;Unser Zimmer war mit Klimaanlage, TV, Telefon und kostenfreiem W-Lan und LAN Zugang ausgestattet.
;
positive;"""Enjoyed this quaint, lovely inn."
;
positive;We were upgraded to a suite which was beautiful, antique furniture, plasma screens, lush carpets, a very comfortable bed and a marble bathroom.
;
positive;The evening was a bit more crowded but my boys, again, loved the cheese and crackers.
;
positive;I tried and it stated no tables were available within 2 hours of the time I wanted.
;
positive;Very well appointed for the price!
;
positive;The hotel is very nice and the hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating.
;
negative;"I am sure better insulation would reduce this problem.\nOtherwise the hotel is well kept and has a good location."""
;
positive;Free wifi (which is sometimes hard to find in a B&B).
;
positive;I was happy with my choice, we were given a large Deluxe Salon, which was a good size and tastefully decorated.\nHotel: It is conveniently located in the Upper East Side close to Central Park, most of the museums and numerous subway lines.
;
positive;"""We are not Fairmont sort of people - we tend to fit in at the Comfort Inn & Suites - however we did decide to splurge for our last two nights in Seattle and stay at the Fairmont Olympic - and it was really lovely."
;
positive;So beware!
;
positive;Arrived with a tired family and got shuttled quickly to the hotel whereupon we all received warm chocolate chip cookies!
;
positive;Got a better deal going directly to their website than by phone.
;
positive;The bell desk advised me to wait one minute for the hotel van.
;
negative;Thank you!
;
positive;"""I was in town to meet with friends who booked rooms before I had a chance to book mine."
;
positive;The beds were so comfortable that we over slept the next morning.WOW!
;
positive;Usually quiet at night, although it is on a main road so we sometimes heard the traffic a little.
;
positive;"This hotel is one of the best values around."""
;
positive;(You can even go down in the basement and see the old vault.)
;
negative;They forgot to leave me wash towels twice in a 5 day span.
;
positive;We thought it was a very good hotel - very handy for Fisherman's wharf and the cable car terminus.
;
negative;I also experienced billing error and loss of item at my room.
;
positive;Everything smells and looks super clean.
;
positive;Plenty of room for just me.\nThe property is well-located, 1.5 blocks from a metro line and a $6 cab ride to Adams Morgan.
;
positive;I ended up speaking with three different people before I talked to Justin the front desk manager.
;
positive;"""We spent four nights in mid-April in this hotel, while visiting our child at UCLA."
;
positive;"It would be impossible to get similar facilities (continental breakfast included) at this rate in downtown dc.\nWhat I didn't like...Not much was there not to like but if I have to nitpick, I would say the lighting in the room was a bit inadequate."""
;
positive;The immediate neighborhood of the hotel is kind of a fringe area, with graffiti, and the occasional unfortunate person asking for a handout.
;
positive;Notre chambre \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s propre et tr\u00e8s confortable.
;
positive;"""I have stayed at this hotel a few times and never have any complaints."
;
positive;We also enjoyed Knuckles at the end of the day for a drink and some football.
;
positive;There is a Starbucks in the lobby of this hotel.
;
positive;The staff was also key to our great time.
;
positive;Nous avons trouv\u00e9 un arrangement lors du check out pour compenser cette m\u00e9saventure car la chambre qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e (la 54, \u00e0 \u00e9viter \u00e0 tout prix), n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec notre chambre en termes de confort, vue, taille...\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, cet h\u00f4tel vaut le coup pour la vue, mais assez d\u00e9cevant concernant le service, la restauration.
;
positive;"I would be happy to recommend it to anyone and will return there again when we fly to los angeles in the future."""
;
positive;The view from our room was spectacular, especially at 7 this morning as the snow came down over the city.
;
positive;What a pleasant surprise.
;
positive;Would I ever stay somewhere else?
;
positive;Old hotel with lots of character.
;
positive;Brett Caplan and Terry Forbes were the banquet managers we dealt with, and they managed their teams with respect, and got amazing results.
;
negative;Rumore insopportabile del condizionatore, e camere sulla strada senza doppie finestre.
;
positive;The design of the hotel is funky and cool.
;
positive;"""March 4 - 14\n44 yo well travelled mom and 16 yo daughter, looking to see as much as possible and visit a few colleges.\nWe reserved via a third party online service and got a variable rate from 210 to 250, total taxes/service included came out to 2085.00."
;
positive;\nThe room was comfortable, especially the king size bed, not so much the sofa-bed.
;
negative;The locker room and inside the park was dirty and disgusting.
;
negative;In sum, if you're accustomed to only the finest, and intend to while-away precious hours in a beautifully appointed room - stay away.
;
positive;"There is a swimming pool!\nThe only downside I can think of is the poor WiFi reception in our room.\nDefinetly great value for money!"""
;
positive;We had a great travelzoo promo rate with a free upgrade.
;
positive;My only complaint would have been that on check in I was not informed that a deposit of $150 per day was taken off my card, this should be been made very clear.
;
negative;Unless $50 more a night is a real necessity, steer clear!!!
;
positive;"""This hotel was in a great location for all of the activities we had planned."
;
positive;If you stay here, you should try the Waffle Shop across from Ford's Theatre.
;
negative;The King room was fine -- clean and basic.
;
negative;If I have to give advice, suck up the extra money and stay at the Hilton.
;
positive;Lots todo within walking distance.
;
positive;Oh well, as long as it's clean, well maintained and service is great...who cares.
;
positive;"""Pour petit budget, hotel tout \u00e0 fait correct,confortable, calme pour les chambres ne donnant pas sur la rue sinon un petit ronflement pour celles cot\u00e9 rue.lit confortable,salle de bain petite mais suffisante,d\u00e9co sombre mais ce n'est pas ce qui comptait pour nous,wifi gratuit dans la chambre."
;
positive;It was also a short 15 minutes taxi ride to and from the Ronald Reagan airport.
;
positive;I had breakfast at Spencers and really enjoyed the breakfast buffet.
;
positive;"""I stayed in the Wellington for three nights last week and thought that it was perfectly fine."
;
positive;"We thought and excellent price for the location- oh yes, enjoyed the neighborhoods and local markets very much."""
;
positive;It is in Powell Street, where you wiil be able to catch the Cable Car (stop just in front of the hotel) or walk towards the Chinese district located not so far from it.\nFor the period when I went, it was the cheapest in that area, no way to reach that rate for the hotel in the surroundings.\nBreakfast is in the average, cleaness as well.
;
positive;Easy walk to the White House and so on.
;
negative;Add to this the lift noise, the outside noise from people arriving, airplanes, women screaming in delight at meeting each other in the coridor at 1.00pm and general air conditioning, toilet flushing, ... OK, you get the picture.\nBreakfast was a very strange affair in a mock British pub.
;
positive;The Staff was very repectful, kind, helpful and friendly!
;
positive;"I am lucky this is on my company's approved list."""
;
positive;The hotel itself was fine safety wise.
;
positive;The replacement room was configured with 2 Queen beds, which made things a bit tight.
;
positive;"""My friend and I stayed at the Salisbury hotel for five nights from 15th feb 07."
;
positive;It is withing walking distance to so many places.
;
positive;Considering the hostels I have stayed in across the US.
;
positive;Great ambiance thoughout the lobby and public areas.
;
positive;The hotel had complimentary coffee in the morning with some muffins and danishes.
;
positive;I arrived at the hotel around 9pm - my reservation was incorrect as it was for an arrival date for the next night - (this was my error) anyway - the plaza was booked!!!
;
negative;The A/C sounded like an old French 1 HP Citroen automobile that one sees in old B/W movies that for some reasons americans think are artsy.
;
positive;The bell-person was helpful, but then he stood under the small protected area in front while I finished grabbing some things from my automobile.
;
positive;The bedroom had another dresser for clothing and a storage bench to lay suitcases were in the room and another large tv.
;
positive;The ladies raved about their spa experiences and absolutely loved their mani/pedi, massages, and facials.
;
positive;And the bouncer and staff at the nightclub always made me feel welcomed and never out of place.\nThe neighborhood is replete with great underrated restaurants (I ate a magical Italian place with a backyard garden) and there's a Bread & Butter across the street from the hotel where I got a fresh Cuban sandwich with a side of Udon noodle at 3:30 AM!
;
positive;"""My stay here has hardly begun and I have a glowing review for this hotel and this team of people!\nMy husband and I have spent the last month living out of suitcases and boxes at his parents house, as our bank gave us the run around while buying a house - we were supposed to close june 8th, we closed today, 6/28.\nI was told we could get the keys today, so we headed down south to move into our place and camp on the floor - we promised his parents they could have their home back today as we have a new puppy and it can be stressful."
;
positive;Breakfast was yummy and the staff was extremely friendly.
;
positive;"""We came with our 20 something children for a holiday getaway."
;
positive;"""A great find, excellent location."
;
positive;The doors are very loud, which is noticeable in the morning as you're trying to get those last few minutes of sleep.
;
positive;The pool is great, even if you are not swimming, the corner views are good to see.
;
positive;The breakfast buffet had a huge selection and should be more than enough for anybody!
;
positive;\nHotel staff was so helpful.
;
positive;"Used to stay at nearby Best Western, this is much improved."""
;
positive;"""I stayed here for three nights with my wife and my mum, the hotel chosen primarily for it's location and free parking, which is a rare and valuable commodity around downtown Chicago."
;
positive;"""Ho passato in questo hotel i primi 10 giorni del mio viaggio di nozze lo scorso novembre."
;
positive;Nice touch was complimentary bottled water and ice in the ice bucket all ready at our arrival (I don't think I've seen that at any other hotel!).
;
positive;The rooms are nice but could use a little update.
;
positive;A much different experience than some hotels we have stayed at.
;
positive;\nThe hotel itself, the gym, bar, amenities are all very good and the location is excellent.
;
negative;So you should rent a vehicle.
;
positive;\nThe hotel has a restaurant on-site, the Rare Bar & Grill.
;
positive;"we wernt even asked if we enjoyed our stay when we were leaving.we had a nice time but found it expensive .the bus tours are brill and Ellis island was fantastic.shops expensive but prices did varey so shop about next door could be cheeper."""
;
positive;I hate Times Square, but you gotta admit it is convenient if you are there to see plays.\nWhile we enjoyed our stay overall, we all agreed that the restaurant (owned by Gordon Ramsey, a celebrity chef from London) was pretentious and had an odd menu.
;
positive;\nBreakfast was good and check-out easy.
;
positive;"""This hotel was centrally located within walking distance to most major attractions in the Times Square/Broadway area."
;
negative;"If you are not at the convention center, don't waste your money and time here."""
;
positive;Bathroom was a little sparse but nicely decorated just like the room and comfortably sized.
;
negative;The rooms have a very bad smell and stinks of pesticide.
;
positive;"""We spent two nights at this Holiday Inn Express and were very happy with everything!"
;
negative;She seemed to know most of the patrons eating.
;
negative;A room in the howard johnson for 110$ per night is much much better, and has internet and 45 channel on tv and has a pool.
;
positive;"""I just loved my stay at this hotel!!!!!!"
;
positive;"""Fantastic hotel with friendly, helpful staff.\nIdeally located for Universal Studios."
;
negative;"""I stayed there for one night."
;
positive;"""The view of the harbor from my room was fantastic and the location of the hotel was perfect!"
;
negative;A few minutes later the young males climed on top of the pool bar's roof and started jumping into the pool.
;
positive;"One quick note is a memory that will stay with us forever,during our time there we were attacked every day by a little bird who was nesting in the surrounding trees and fauna of the pool,despite the best efforts of the brilliant garden staff to locate and remove him and his family (due to some miserable guests)he remained and provided entertainment all the time we were poolside,truly hilarious to watch big guys (6ft plus) dodging this tiny but determined little bird!"""
;
positive;"We had a great time in New York and would got back to that hotel again but I'm still disappointed with the treatment we got."""
;
positive;Its in a great location within minutes of the riverside shopping center and the jacksonville zoo.
;
positive;And of course, Penn Station.
;
positive;\nNOTE: The Black Rose Irish Pub across the street serves delicious food in an authentic pub atmosphere.
;
positive;It was a little cool, so she went and got a fresh duvet cover and wrapped it around me.
;
negative;We use the T whenever in Boston.
;
positive;"Highly recommended hotel great value for money will come back when in DC again."""
;
positive;Location great.
;
positive;From the moment I checked in, the customer service was superb.
;
positive;"Il est evident que le parking est cher mais c'est le m\u00eame prix dans quasiment tous les hotels \u00e0 los angeles, il y a que dans les motels que le parking est gratuit."""
;
positive;"We will definitely stay again."""
;
positive;Migh be a little warm during the summer though.
;
positive;Loved the complimentary internet, awsome connection.
;
positive;Loved the safety features implemented by the hotel.
;
positive;The menu changes but includes a meat (sausage or bacon), eggs on some days (although my daughter commented that it doesn't taste like real eggs), pancakes and doughnuts on some days, and there was always oatmeal, several types of cereals, fruit, yogurt, texas sized and shaped waffles you make yourself, milk (chocolate, 2% and skim), juice (cranberry, grapefruit, orange), muffins, bagels, english muffins, and coffee/tea.
;
positive;"El ultimo piso tiene una terraza totalmente vidriada, ahi es donde se desayuna con una vista so\u00f1ada a la ciudad!"""
;
negative;It would be nicer if you can sit, and nicer yet if they would spend 40 dollars to get better mice than the cheap, rollerball ones they use that don't move very well.\n6.
;
negative;They didn't even provide additional toiletries the second day.
;
positive;"It is in a great location and it feels like you are coming \""home\"" at night, rather than to a big, corporate hotel."
;
positive;But we were only one block away and close to everything, with the comfort of being away from everything, quaint and quiet.
;
negative;"""We went for Mother's Day."
;
positive;(I understand not all rooms had that however).
;
positive;The staff at the wine service were extremely professional and welcoming.
;
negative;"""Originally from San Francisco, I needed to return there for business."
;
positive;This was our first trip to New York, but when we return we will definitely stay at The Belvedere again.
;
positive;They helped us get around town and gave excellent directions.
;
positive;"This is a special spot, I really mean it."""
;
positive;"""I came with my family while my Dad was attending a convention in the Winter."
;
positive;This hotel has recently been renovated from what I can see thus the room was very clean, updated and had all of the ammenties needed for a one night stay (and more if needed) It is in a central location and would be great for anyone on business or vacation travel.
;
positive;well, it didn't last very long, but i am terrified of being stuck in an elevator, so I wasn't too happy about this.
;
positive;The sheets were smooth and soft!
;
negative;Every door bangs, as if it were your own roomdoor.
;
positive;We loved the pool area, it was like a little hideaway form city life outside.\nWe were promptly greeted by friendly staff and given our room with no extra charge even though we were about 2 hours early!
;
positive;\nThe fitness center is much nicer than what I normally see at other hotels.
;
positive;"Right off Michigan Ave."""
;
positive;WiFi is easily accessible in the public area but it would be good to have it in the rooms especially when you aren't feeling well.
;
positive;"From the moment we arrived at midnight without any luggage, which had been misplaced ex Australia, the staff could not of been more helpful.\nThey provided us with the necesities of life and a late night upgrade.\nBreakfast was first class, as was the room.\nWhilst the views are tainted by the location, the location from a tourist point of view was awesome.\n Will gladly return next year."""
;
positive;We were out for most of the days but we usually made it back to the hotel before the High Tea was over.
;
positive;"""stayed here during a conference week but didn't notice any glitches or slow service."
;
positive;Jay, especially, was very friendly and helpful.
;
positive;"""I just stayed 3 nights (Feb. 2012)."
;
positive;Had some great happy hour deals on drinks + appetizers.
;
negative;Nice Martini specials.
;
positive;"""I have stayed in this hotel many times over the past 20 years."
;
negative;Mind you I had swiped my card already which read my room number and such.
;
negative;It left a bad taste in the mouth and for this reason I think the hotel was very overrated.
;
positive;We initially booked a Queen Room with shared bath but decided to upgrade to a private bathroom a week or so before our departure.
;
positive;or Lot 38 Espresso bar around the corner (not busy).
;
positive;"""I stayed at the St. Giles Hotel in August and was both impressed and disappointed.\nTheir location is awesome."
;
negative;I waited no less than 15 minutes twice and more than 5 minutes almost every time.
;
positive;The lounge has sofas and easy chairs, a computer with printer, TV, and a snack bar, where presumably they offer snacks on certain days (though not on weekends).
;
positive;"""I thought this was great value for money to stay in such an amazing place."
;
positive;She refused to let me pay, but upgraded my two levels to a larger Mega-King room.
;
positive;Took ages to get served because of the party... but hey.
;
negative;I called city club and spoke to their billing people on mulitple occasions and every time they promised to call me the next day to issue a credit and NEVER DID.
;
positive;"We will come back again and would rate five stars if there was free wifi."""
;
negative;I can even understand the hotel downgrading the room because they thought there would only be one guest, but the downgraded room was so inferior to what I had booked that even if it had only been me staying at the hotel, I would have wanted a heads p that there was a problem (and would have expected some compensation for paying for something I wasn't getting).\n- Being lied to that there were no rooms with king sized beds when obviously there were.\nWe had several other problem during our stay:\n1.
;
positive;"""This was my fifth visit to New York but was the first time for my boyfriend and his parents so I wanted somewhere that was central, clean and affordable."

;
positive;"They have fireworks every Wednesday and Saturday.\n When we return to the city, we will stay at the Homewood Suits and nowhere else!"""
;
positive;The hotel looks old and dated in areas, and there was no coffee making facilities in the room, but these are fairly small drawbacks.
;
positive;"WILL DEFINATELY STAY NEXT CRUISE OUT OF JAX."""
;
positive;Our Ford Escape rental fit snugly but to be honest, some of the spaces were a bit narrow on the nights that we got in late.
;
positive;The room had a large bathroom, completely accessible, and it all just worked for us.
;
positive;an alley...smelled of ciggarette smoke, although we requested non-smoking.
;
positive;The front desk did send security up to quiet them down, but they would just strike it up again the next night.
;
positive;$8 each way.
;
positive;We checked in late - about midnight and everything in and around the hotel was closed.
;
negative;I don't know if there is any legal recourse to stop this, but I suggest the hotel try to do something to put a stop to this.
;
negative;"""Stayed here as it was close to the airport, we had a very early start."
;
positive;Our three grandchildren are not complainers which was why we did not learn of this mistake until our third day.
;
positive;They have an arrangement with a car service which virtually the same price as a taxi (about $45 with tip from the SF airport) and if shared by a group is as cheap as the SuperShuttle (which is $15 a person to the airport).\nFinally, the staff is wonderful.
;
positive;"If you're not a whiner and complainer about petty little stuff, you'll enjoy staying here."""
;
positive;"Vale pela localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e o pre\u00e7o modesto."""

positive;This trip I was pleasantly surprised by a complementary tray of chips and salsa, candied walnuts, chocolates, and gummy bears waiting for me in the room, along with an upgrade to Marriott Rewards gold status.
;
negative;The air con was ineffectual.
;
positive;La posizione \u00e8 eccellente essendo a 30 metri dalla fermata della BART che lo collega all'aeroporto, a due isolati da Union Square, di fronte alla fermata della cablecar.
;
negative;Woke up at 7am to a woman having a phone conversation for almost 2 hours.
;
positive;Very nice.
;
positive;The Empire State Building really is right around the corner.
;
positive;"""We stayed over the Christmas break."
;
negative;The manager told me he was sorry and that he would transfer me -- at 10:30 p.m.!
;
negative;"We got a 'courtyard' room; sounds nice, right?"
;
positive;We even found reasonable parking on 43rd and 10th Avenue - $18 per 24 hours (look for parking in NYC in iconparking.com)!
;
positive;Bathroom pretty small.
;
positive;There was a nice coffee shop with porch (Starbucks) in the lobby.
;
positive;We had our money's worth in the first day and, what could be more pleasant than catching the California cable car back to the hotel?
;
positive;Breakfast was hot and plentiful.
;
negative;El aire acondicionado goteaba adentro de la habitaci\u00f3n lo que generaba un charco, que al ser piso alfombrado, estaba tooodo el piso de la habitaci\u00f3n mojado y no se podr\u00edan poner las maletas en el.
;
negative;I also wrote the regional manager, Mike Donahue, but he never responded.
;
positive;No bugs and it was fabulous being about a block away from the Empire State Building.
;
negative;\nThe next day, we went back to the Ramada where finally we could have a room for the rest of the stay.
;
positive;"kids love that!\nTY Trump!"""
;
positive;"""We had a fabulous time at The Windsor Suites!"
;
positive;My Orig Room was Beautifiul but had a Broken AC..
;
positive;"Minimum charge US$5\nI know hotels are struggling to make money but these charges are excessive."""
;
positive;we stayed on the 15th floor which is considered the Gold floor, would do that again in a heartbeat.
;
negative;Do to the lateness, we spent the night but requested a change first thing in the morning.
;
negative;"I wouldn't stay here again."""
;
positive;"""I recently stayed at this Fairfield Inn for a second time, this time choosing a king suite."
;
positive;I had a hard time going to sleep--our room was right on Lexington and even though we didn't get back to the hotel until after 1am on both nights, it was still difficult for me to fall asleep with all the traffic noise.
;
positive;The room we got was huge with a view of windows from the office building next door.
;
positive;The Hotel was centrally located to everything.
;
negative;"""I stayed here because of the location in lower east , the sleek architecture of the building and the cool vibe of the area.\nUnfortunatelly after 5 years of opening , the decor fall down in maintenance, some stain on the carpet and scratch on the furniture make this place declining and not as appealing as expexted.\nthe staff is amateur and desinterested.\nThe value for money is poor."""
;
positive;It's in a safe location HOWEVER I was told it was very close to Times Sq.
;
positive;The hotel does NOT have true black-out shades or anything like that.\n--Avoid the restaurant, which was mediocre at best and overpriced (like most of the food in that area).\nOverall good choice.
;
positive;The room was impressive, with great views, beautiful soft furnishings and all the top class gadgets.
;
positive;The Hotel was wonderful from the check in by a terrific worker named Jason who gave us our keys, maps and directions to our room, let us know that our internet would be free and if there was anything needed to call immediately and ask for him.
;
positive;"""Sch\u00f6nes altes Hotel in guter Lage."
;
negative;Coffee, OJ and fruit juices - fine when it wasn't running out.
;
positive;They have a take-away cafe in the foyer, but the food is dreadful!
;
positive;When we walked in, we thought they might have messed up our reservation because the room was huge (compared with the one we had just checked out of--- for the same price).
;
negative;We moved down the street to the Palomar which was a lot nicer, friendlier, luxurious, more expensive, and just plain better!!
;
positive;The public area of the hotel is well maintained, stylish and very enjoyable to 'sit back' in.
;
positive;However, Universal Studios was right next door and you could either walk to the park or wait for the hotel shuttle to take you which went every 10-15 minutes.
;
positive;"\nDo tell cab drivers that it is the Courtyard on Exeter ST."""
;
positive;Friendly service and the driver was accommodating in dropping me at the US Airways hangar, which was not on his regular route.
;
positive;TV service, on demand, minibar, snacks (overpriced as always), some other articles that you may want in an emergency (anti acids, condoms).
;
positive;"""I stayed at the NYMA Hotel back in April & found it to be a very nice Hotel from check in to checkout the staff were very helpful."
;
negative;Not worth the price.
;
positive;It is also a non-refundable rate.
;
negative;I was kept waiting 30 minutes while they tried to find an available room and it was NOT the room type I had paid for.
;
negative;The reception staff were uninterested and ill informed.
;
positive;Justin was very friendly and cordial.
;
positive;We slept soundly in the comfortable queen bed and appreciated the large shower in an otherwise small bathroom.
;
positive;It was about a 10-15 minute walk to Union Square and the Hyde-Powell cable car line.
;
positive;"\nIn the past I\u2019ve paid three to four times as much per night for a lesser experience."""
;
positive;"We asked if we could be transferred to a quieter room and duty manager Luis was very accommodating, as were all the staff we encountered during our stay."""
;
positive;She was very pleasant, always smiling and very knowledgable about the city.
;
positive;Windows open to fresh air.
;
positive;Rooms were clean and very comfortable.
;
positive;The doorman was helpful and courteous and the front desk was most pleasant.
;
negative;I asked for directions to the laundry room to get new linens myself and was told that guests are not allowed in the laundry area.
;
negative;"I am kind of confused how two shower heads makes it \""Heavenly\""."
;
negative;"""There are only 2 good things to say about this hotel."
;
positive;In addition to the flatscreen TV, every room has an Apple I-pad which you can use to access hotel services and to look at local maps.
;
negative;At 3 a.m. husband had had enough of the noise and wanted to leave but we stuck it out til daylight and checked out.
;
positive;This includes the janitor/ maintenance guy I met in the elevator, the doormen, bartenders, everyone.
;
positive;"We will be there again, certainly."""
;
positive;The stay was quiet, and restful.
;
positive;I originally chose the hotel for its size and proximity to Union Station, but quickly realized upon arrival that we had found a very special place.
;
positive;You must go to the San Diego Zoo if you have children.
;
positive;The rooms are small but nicely decorated, and on the 8th floor, anyway, very quiet.
;
positive;My office booked this hotel for me because my three hotel preferences were sold out (Hotel Monaco, Grand Hyatt, W).
;
positive;Only stayed as managed to get a promotional rate over winter.
;
positive;Zimmer super sauber.

;
positive;"Great bang for you buck."""
;
positive;"""We've put our friends and family here recently and spent some time there."
;
positive;"I don't think we'll be staying here again."""
;
negative;"We demanded a refund after the first morning, and ate at a Greek diner around the corner on Newbury Street for the rest of the week."""
;
positive;The beds are very comfortable and the room is very clean.
;
negative;Upon check in, we're told we have to pay a $50 deposit for the room, even though we spoke to the hotel numerous times about the total costs, nobody mentioned this.
;
positive;As it turned out the room was ideal.
;
positive;I really liked it, it's not the fanciest hotel in town but it's pretty good, the people in the front desk are very friendly and helpful, they know a lot about directions and they were eager to help us and give us tips about where to go and where not to go.

positive;"I am very loyal to Marriott and, needless to say, was very disappointed that this happened."""
;
positive;The hotel itself is lovely and the rooms very spacious.
;
positive;However if you are planning your L.A. trip and you are over 25 I highly recommend hiring a car, the roads are easy but public transport is awful!
;
positive;It was clean and staff was friendly.
;
positive;I used some SPG points to get a room for a nice price.
;
positive;This time, however, I was not.
;
positive;There is also a gym in the lower floor although I have no idea what's it like, I got enough exercise walking around Manhattan Island!
;
positive;\nThe free internet is nice, and the business center has the PC, internet, printer, and FedEx supplies.
;
positive;"I didn't feel crammed into a room, instead there was room to breathe!"""
;
positive;"We can thoroughly recommend this hotel."""
;
positive;Since I had time to kill Sunday before my flight.
;
positive;It could be quite noisy as well from the bus terminal but you got use to the noise.
;
positive;This hotel has character!
;
positive;We understand they are under new management, and we commend them for being concerned about the environment.

;
positive;"Would definitely recommend this hotel."""
;
positive;"""This was a nice hotel, but right on I-5 interstate...so quite noisy with sounds of traffic....on the side of the hotel we were on."
;
positive;The hotel is right near the Moscone convention center, Yerba Buena gardens, SFMOMA, Meteron (multiplex cinema, food court for inexpensive dining and Target), the giant Westfield Mall with Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and more.
;
negative;The breakfast here is very limited.
;
positive;The front desk staff are friendly and helpful.
;
positive;My sister was up and out walking, while enjoying the San Diego Skyline, every morning.
;
negative;Despite any good qualities this hotel might have, I was miserable the whole time, and so give Club Quarters the lowest rating.

negative;"If we did not insist to change it, they would force us to stay in the handycapped room for the rest of the week."""
;
positive;The beds are so yummy, it made it hard to get out of bed some mornings.
;
positive;"Great location for viewing the sites!"""
;
positive;"Extremely modern with a fantastic entrance a few steps from Times Square."""
;
negative;The sofa had holes in the cushions and you could see the padding.
;
positive;\nThe rooms are quite small but thats standard in new york.
;
negative;The hotel removed one and moved the dog but the other continued it's howling.
;
positive;I love the new ambiance, the attention to detail, the comfortably large and well-appointed guest rooms, and the terrific housekeeping staff.
;
negative;\nAll night long (til after 3AM) there were people going in and out of all the rooms above us...stomping up & down the stairs.
;
positive;High-speed Internet wired and wireless as well!
;
positive;Our room was very comfortable, we got a great nights sleep on both occasions.
;
negative;The best things about the T & C are the grounds (lovely tropical flowers, vines and roses everywhere with gazebos, trellises, benches, and the pools), and the location next to the trolley system and mall.
;
positive;"You don't always have to be in the middle of everything all the time, and Lowell Hotel is a nice place to kick back and relax, knowing that you are steps away from anything you want or need at any time."""

positive;This was very comforting to me as a woman spending most of my time alone at the hotel.
;
positive;Fun, Eclectic hotel.
;
positive;"Lullaby music to MY ears."""
;
positive;"""The hotel was a bargain."
;
positive;The park central is a good hotel - not great but good.
;
positive;Not knowing much about Shelter Island, and having a picky husband, I really hoped our stay would be worth the $$.
;
positive;We will stay here again!
;
positive;Other plusses: a nightly turn-down service (with chocolate mints) and bath robes.\nCheck-in was quick and easy.
;
positive;But since we checked in late on thursday night and were (unfortunately) only staying for one day, the front desk clerk said he would upgrade us.

positive;\nThis hotel is older but has been renevated.
;
positive;We did have trouble with the tv in the room, but as soon as we reported it, housekeeping was quick to respond and promptly replaced it.
;
positive;Set in the grounds of acres of countryside (ideal for golfers), you could be forgiven for thinking you were in Italy or Spain.
;
negative;The receptionists are cold and unfriendly the rooms are tiny, you fall into the bed on opening the door.
;
positive;"""I had an awesome experience at the Hotel Monaco Chicago."
;
positive;Would certainly recommend to others.\nOur only negative was that we booked into the hotel during its restoration process.
;
positive;When all businesses are looking for an edge over their competitors, this is surely the easiest thing to give, especially to so-called valued guests especially when your hotel is half-empty.\nVent over.
;
positive;"""Shuttle from the Airport is standard $14."
;
positive;We had a 2 bdrm/2 bath suite on the 4th floor.

negative;The hotel is in a great location, is very clean, the room was huge, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the service was awful.
;
positive;The parking is pricey, so beware of that.
;
negative;In the mean time we went to see the room.
;
positive;When we checked in and got to the room, it was huge and had an amazing view (Corner room) BUT... no sofa bed like we requested.

positive;"Hotel is in a great upper west side neighbor hood near subway.\nOn the Ave is my home away from home ."""
;
positive;The location was great, the room was clean and good sized with comparable amenities.

negative;We ended up leaving anyway and had to pay out more money for another hotel.
;
positive;Before arriving we'd read some reviews which said the decor was a bit tired.
;
positive;Subway is one block away.
;
positive;"""My husband and I stayed one night in October, just for a quick get-away from home."
;
positive;The professionalism given by Juan C was outstanding.
;
negative;Also if you are going to allow pets, someone should pick up after the dogs if the owner isn't, stepped in dog poop twice walking across the grass in the front.
;
positive;"A very good option in Manhattan"""
;
negative;We arrived and checked in and as soon as we got off the elevator on our floor the smell of marijuana almost knocked us down.
;
positive;It is conveniently located close to Union Square shopping, the Mason St cable cars and the streetcars on Market down to the wharf.
;
positive;Soon, however, the initial response changes---The layouts are awkward...the chair at the desk--the only one---has its back to the TV....You have to watch TV in bed or move the chair.
;
positive;"""Stayed here 2 nights on a July (Humid & Hot ) weekend and would stay again if it were just for 1 to 2 nights again."
;
positive;Pool is excellent although the workout room is at the back of the hotel, I guess it's okay since you have to walk to get there.
;
positive;Always get a great free breakfast with a wonderful omelet chef.
;
positive;Very quiet, too, no noise either from adjacent rooms or outside.\nOne of the coolest areas was the outside porch overlooking the city on the 16th floor.
;
negative;A $100 discount TOTAL for 3 nights stay (~ $33/night) on a $237/night room rate.\nEven with power this hotel is not worth it.
;
positive;To our left was a very nice shower with a window, 3 different water heads and a place to sit if you wanted.
;
positive;we decided to stay last minute at this hotel because we were going to the (free!)
;
positive;Starbucks to the left of the hotel.
;
positive;"Will continue to use it as my preferred place in NY."""
;
positive;Have stayed in every brand of hotel.
;
positive;The only downside was the size of the rooms, especially the bathroom.

positive;Aufgrund der zantralen Lage nat\u00fcrlich auch laut - in den unteren Etagen sp\u00fcrt man zus\u00e4tzlich die U-Bahn.
;
positive;The views were spectacular, the decor lavish, and the food was delicious.
;
positive;There is a fantastic bar (with a brilliant view) and a restuarant in the hotel if you want.

positive;The computers and printers in the lobby were handy, although they were usually occupied and the Internet is a tad slow.

;
positive;50 Euro.
;
positive;Christopher Cunje, the desk manager stands out, giving the best advice for directions, restaurants and secret tips like just dropping by Walgreens for a pint of hagaan Daaz because the ice cream store was too much a walk for me to make.
;
positive;\nI think the other, larger rooms with light were probably much better than mine.
;
negative;Nosotros lo reservamos a trav\u00e9s de Rumbo.es, y finalmente nos devolvieron el dinero de la estancia.
;
positive;The room was spacious, very clean with an extremely comfortable bed!
;
positive;Were not impressed by the american restaurant on site though.

;
positive;\nI love the dogs who stay with their humans, which added to our stay.
;
positive;Join the Gold Club and receive a bottle of wine when you check in.
;
negative;The bathroom was teeny tiny, and made to feel smaller by the enormous cabinet and pedestal sink.
;
positive;"""We've just returned from our stay at the Belvedere - there were four of us (female) and we shared a room with 2 doubles to save money."
;
positive;All the people who worked there from the front desk, to bell-person to housekeeping cheerfully and graciously helped make our stay fabulous.
;
positive;"""My experience at Homestead Suites was none like ever before at this type of hotel."
;
positive;"This will be our new San Diego hotel from now on!!"""

positive;\nWhen we got into our room later, they had left us a bottle of champagne and cookies in our room.
;
positive;Die Zimmer sind zwar nciht sehr gro\u00df, aber trotzdem sehr chic und gem\u00fctlich eingerichtet.

positive;"""I have stayed at several Marriott's while traveling to Charlotte for work (Residence Inn Southpark and Tyvola/77, Arrowood Fairfield Inn and Courtyard, and Renaissance Southpark) and the Marriott Executive Park is head and shoulders above all of them."
;
positive;Service is slower and less attentive than at a luxury property but this property avoids the chill that sometimes goes with a properties that think they are cooler than their guest (e.g.
;
positive;Also, the internet situation is awful at this place.
;
positive;\nWe had two stays this January and had good stays both times.

negative;"When I went down to complain to the staff, I got a tepid \""sorry\""."
;
positive;I definitely recommend the Omni Berkshire.
;
positive;"""My husband and I purchased our thru the living social special."

;
negative;"""This hotel has a great location in the Chicago Loop, but it is VERY close to the tracks for the Chicago L (the elevated railroad, Chicago's version of a subway)."
;
positive;I don't think they had even opened it for the season at that point.
;
positive;The location is exceptionally convenient if you have business at Virgina Mason Clinic or Hospital.
;
positive;"That room apparently has no desk (just a coffee table), and you need to be under 5'8\"" to use the shower!"
;
positive;I look forward to coming back.

positive;Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Zimmers war ok, wenn es auch etwas schwierig war die Koffer unterzubringen.
;
negative;"Never stayed at a hotel where I had to request someone to clean my room every day I was there."""
;
positive;It was typical.
;
positive;The whole thing was quite the headache and annoying.\nNow back to the hotel, we did our laundry downstairs.
;
positive;Our very large king room had 15 ft ceilings, a quiet efficient air conditioner, comfortable bath, and practically unused sleeper sofa.
;
positive;Lovely fresh flower arrangements everywhere.
;
positive;After reading Trip advisor tips i was a bit worried abt the location, yet i booked for one night On our road trip down to New orleans we wanted to visit memphis and ass soon as i reached the hotel i decided to stay for one more night for the place was totally good and the location safe.

negative;)\nThere was a crowded rooftop bar which was nice for good weather evenings.
;
negative;First room I was given: tub had 3 long hairs, sink had food matter stuck and dried out meaning the maid hadn't properly cleaned it, clean ?
;
negative;The guy at the hotel simply read me the same generic email that he sent me earlier.
;
positive;The only problem I had was the AC letting off a little mist that eventually made the carpet damp or it was the Florida humidity and a long hot shower that made the carpet damp.
;
negative;The small room was mostly clean, but the dirty spot that was on the table when we arrived was still there when we left 4 days later.
;
positive;No, I did not deprive anyone of a medical necessity.

positive;"""Stayed at the Park Central again and was not dissapointed!\nThe room we got was even better than last time: Spacious, very clean, good bathroom and flat-screen TV.\nThe location is perfect and after seeing the pictures of hotelrooms in other hotels: very, very good quality for a reasonable price in New York.\nHighly recommended!"""

positive;Breakfast was nice and enjoyed making our own waffles with my daughter at breakfast.

negative;She called my room 10 minutes later to tell me that the airline site was telling her that my airline was saying I must be traveling on NWA.
;
positive;"We had a great time and will definitely return to the Grand Hyatt in the future!"""
;
positive;So I called the hotel directly and spoke with a wonderful guy named Noah in the reservations office.
;
positive;The rooms, too!
;
positive;Also I might mention that you are able to enjoy in and out services with your car,meaning you can take your car out for the day and return, this again is something you never find in NYC.
;
positive;THE ROOM.
;
positive;"""We needed a hotel near the Airport."
;
positive;Marriott recently updated this hotel and my room was beautiful, clean, and comfortable.
;
positive;Very clean.
;
positive;The location of the hotel is amazing, the staff is one of the friendliest I have ever encountered, and the wine reception is so relaxing.
;
positive;"Check your room carefully, but for the most part the Quality Inn Executive Park should be fine for a short stay at a decent price."""
;
positive;"You cannot beat this hotel for the price, quality, and perfect location."""
;
negative;When I called the front desk on three occasions, it took them once 19 rings to answer and twice nobody answered at all and this was in the evening not during peak check in time.
;
positive;Pretty clean though.
;
positive;Great location and very close to all the attrations.
;
positive;"Also it's very clean; just what we needed in the Flat Iron building area."""
;
positive;Most staff members were wonderful.
;
negative;I will never stay at another Loew's hotel and I will be as vocal as possible if ever given the opportunity to influence someone else's decision.
;
positive;The views from the balcony were amazing.
;
positive;It's still close enough to walk to theatres.
;
positive;Being from the Baltimore/Metropolitan area, I'd never experienced the comfort of Days Inn...but felt I had struck gold when I visited them for two days to relax and obtain some peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle.
;
negative;Alles im Allen k\u00fcmmert sich keiner um evtl.
;
positive;"""This place captures the hip, funky feel of the Austin SoCo District and if you are in Austin to have fun I highly recommend it (without the kids!)"
;
positive;Realmente lo pasamos EXCELENTE!!!
;
positive;"All in all a great hotel."""
;
positive;It was very well maintained by both repair and cleanliness.
;
positive;\nWe got the train from the airport as it is much cheaper and we didn't have lots of luggage, it was about $9 each in total.
;
positive;Loved the complete hot breakfast in the morning that was included, and also thought the free 'happy hour' at 5:30pm in the atrium was a very nice little extra.
;
positive;Our room was cleaned right after we left every morning.
;
positive;There were bus stops all over near the motel, and we also walked about everywhere, so it was very easy to get places.
;
positive;"or if you will be on \""the wedding party floor\""."
;
positive;Stellar service, and exceptionally friendly staff.
;
positive;(Yeah, that's the way I roll.
;
positive;I have a eye for this aspect of my stay and I can say with confidence that the housekeeping staff does a remarkable job.
;
positive;I prefer a softer bed and feather pillows, so I may not be in the norm with my preferences.
;
positive;The staff were all friendly and helpful.
;
positive;Large, clean, quiet, with a beautiful view of downtown Boston.
;
positive;"""One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at."
;
positive;You can even brew yourself up a cup of coffee or tea to go with them.
;
negative;\nTo alleviate the horrible night and morning that they had created for us, we were told that we are given free breakfast but when we went to actually eat it the guy tells us that we are allowed two items from their breakfast bar!!
;
positive;Io avevo chiesto una camera a un piano alto con vista e ci hanno dato l'ultimo piano con una vista FANTASTICA sulla 5a e saint patrick da una parte( vedi foto), il Rockefeller, il Radio City e tutta la 51sima strada fino all'Hudson river dall'altra .
;
negative;"""I had read the terrible reviews before hand and thought i could easily live with the dirty rooms and bad service but wow was i suprised at bad this hotel actually was."
;
negative;All they did was merely apologize and that was it.
;
positive;The mini bars are okay.
;
positive;\nRooms were tiny - we managed to get an upgrade and it was still a shoe box - but that's what you get in NYC.
;
negative;We asked for someone to just meet us at the new room so we wouldn't be burdened with moving our luggage yet again up and down the stairs and elevators.
;
positive;After breakfast, I ran into one of the employees (forgot name) tall good looking lad.
;
positive;We were there 9 days and it was very enjoyable.
;
positive;Maybe along with the UT rate for orientation, there could be an option to include breakfast for either a nominal fee or have breakfast included.\nThe hotel itself is very nice and clean.
;
positive;"""Booked when it was Jumeirah Essex House and they switched to Marriott before I got there."
;
positive;Staff can also get a cab for you upon request.

;
negative;"The manager was extremely apologetic."""
;
positive;"""In Seattle for one week of work La Quinta Inn & Suites provided a good room for a great price with breakfast included."
;
positive;It had a shower but no bathtub.
;
positive;Our room is small but clean and perfect for what we need-a place to sleep in Chicago.
;
positive;Its like that at most outdoor pools though in Az during high temp Summer days.
;
positive;We had originally looked for a suite with a kitchen but wouldn't have used one in the end.\nThe bathroom was very small but clean - if only hotels would include more towel hooks and shelf space!
;
positive;The Hyde-Powell cable car stopped on that corner.
;
positive;Always perfect in every way.
;
positive;We rented bikes at Pier 39 and rode across the Golden Gate Bridge through Sausalito to Tiberon and caught the ferry back to the wharf.
;
positive;I should say that this was not my first choice for lodging on this trip because I wasn't familiar with the hotel and was not sure the location would be a benefit.
;
positive;We never heard any noises from the hallways or other rooms throughout our stay.
;
positive;\nThe hotel is very european feeling, spotless, appointed in a very charming way.
;
positive;I loved having the kitchen with a coffee maker, burners, toaster, full size fridge and freezer, full size microwave, plus a living room, along with the bedroom and nice bathroom.
;
positive;\nThe best part was the location.
;
positive;"""I've stayed in the city many times always paying more."
;
negative;The breakfast was your typical hotel quick breakfast.
;
positive;"Highly recommended!"""
;
positive;It was a little bothersome.
;
positive;Our king-bed suite on the 12th floor was very spacious (though closet/storage space is limited) and completely quiet, with a straight-on view of the beautiful Chrysler Building.
;
negative;"""I had an uneventful stay here in mid-May, 2008."
;
negative;We got one tiny bar of soap to divide between the sink and the shower.
;
positive;"""Hotellet ligger sentralt plassert n\u00e6rt Grand Central Station, med kort vei til 5th avenue, Times Square, mv.\nStandarden p\u00e5 b\u00e5de service og rengj\u00f8ring var meget bra, s\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 rommene."
;
positive;"""Never having previously stayed at a J.W."
;
positive;"Other than that we had a plesant stay and would use this hotel again."""
;
positive;I really enjoyed seeing the working canals - for which Venice Beach - are named for closeby.
;
positive;Los ascensores son solamente 2 pero no ten\u00edamos que esperar mucho para usarlo.
;
positive;However a quick call to the hotel solved our problem we spoke to one of the managers he was Scottish I think sorry I cant remember his name but he was very accommodating and got us the rate.
;
positive;It's *so cool* looking that you feel like you're in a movie or something.
;
positive;\nI debated between giving this a 3 or a 4.
;
positive;"Il personale \u00e8 stato gentile e disponibile.\nSe dovessi ritornare a New York, tornerei al Moderne!!\nConsigliatissimo!!!"""
;
negative;"""Very noisy hotel from traffic, and hundred machines, air ac, vents, pumps, etc from hotel and others buildings nearby."
;
positive;But, I couldn't recommend this hotel more.
;
positive;"Great value!"""
;
positive;Of course construction accross the street and noice at about 7h45am but we had to get up to get ready to visit the museums, so it did not bother us.
;
positive;"""Very nice and convenient of many attractions...walking distance to Fenway."""
;
positive;But there were all, I guess, part of the hotel's service proposition, and it was, overall, a good one.
;
positive;The king bed was exceptionally comfortable.
;
negative;The mini-fridge is very old.
;
positive;Not much nightlife round graceland area, only a few eating houses, but can get free shutle bus to sun studio from graceland during daytime last returning 6pm, or get a taxi back later.
;
positive;"""Stayed 3 nights at the end of July 2004."
;
positive;"Would definately recommend this hotel."""
;
positive;So, he contacted the front desk and suggested we be assigned another room.
;
positive;"I am especially pleased with Mark having brought coffee directly to my bedside this morning; what a lovely man."
;
positive;The hotel isn't situated close to anything so I would highly recommend renting a car during your stay.
;
positive;"""Hotel was in a great location for Sea world Mission beach and the San Diego zoo."
;
positive;Highly recommend & would stay again!!
;
positive;The hallways of the hotel are also well lit, attractive and clean.\nThe room was somewhat small, but the size you expect in a large hotel in a metropolitan area.
;
negative;"We stay a night in FW every few months as a \""staycation\"" from Dallas for a break from the kids."
;
positive;Cafe to have breakfast or mini-market are nearby.
;
positive;The service was very good.
;
positive;Paul Lotz was patient and attentive throughout the entire event, Diane, Baron, Randy, Roman, Mohammad and Pedro in banquets NEVER missed a thing they were all extremely customer driven.
;

;
negative;the first room smelled of cigarette smoke and was yellowed by this even thought we asked for a none smoking room.
;
positive;"The location is the best!"""
;
positive;Anyone that has stayed in New York before will know how difficult it is to find an affordable hotel in New York - rooms are usually very small and overpriced.
;
positive;Reasonable walking distance to Times Square and the Theatre District.
;
positive;I am a priority club member and the reception they had was beyond words!
;
positive;Pool and lazy river are heated, though I did not get a chance enjoy them this time.
;
positive;It might be a little pricier than nearby hotels, but it's worth it.
;
positive;My wife and I enjoyed the pool and eating dinner almost every night by the pool.
;
positive;5min.\nUm in die Lobby des Hotels zu gelangen, muss man zuerst mit dem Aufzug 2 Stockwerke nach oben fahren.
;
positive;"We don't recommend rooms in the 02-06 line since the air handler for the hotel is outside those windows and it is quite noisy."""
;
positive;"Everything was above average, just don't buy the food or drinks there and maybe they'll learn that they need to come down to earth on those prices."""
;
positive;While we complained about the noise, it continued most of the night, each night.
;
positive;We were greeted by a friendly staff.
;
positive;"It's as though the hotel has never gotten rundown and required an overhaul, and has remained busy throughout its lifetime."""
;
negative;I like the location and the flat screen TV, but would like them to take more responsibility for repairs.
;
positive;"The area is great and I would strongly recommend this hotel."""
;
negative;After waiting for about 10-15 minutes we were approached by Amy asking if she could help.
;
negative;I called again later, as we were now getting closer to downtown and I was a little nervous.
;
positive;as we finally arrived at the hotel we were greated by andrew.after a friendly check in we went up to our room to get ready to hit the city and it was beautiful and amazingly clean.it was really nice to have a business desk in the room and still have space to walk around :).
;
positive;The amenities include aveda bathing/hair products.
;
negative;"""I would have to agree with all the negative reviews!"
;
positive;"The food was more than adequate as well.\nWhen we return to Washington, we will stay there again."""

positive;The neighbourhood is quite and we felt very safe there at all times of the day and night.
;
positive;Right next to a Metro Station.
;
positive;There was also some sort of congregating spot just below us and people were screaming until at least 2 am.
;
positive;Staff on the front desk and in the bar were not always aware of the facilities available.
;
positive;There is no in-hotel restaurant, but the Buckeye Hall of Fame Grille is right next door, which is a great place to have lunch/dinner/drinks.
;
positive;"The room itself was super clean, very comfortable and well appointed and overall a great value for this level of luxury."""
;
positive;Public transport within SF doesn't seem to be at the standard of major european cities.
;
positive;Arrived at 1pm and room was ready to check in.
;
positive;I did mot get a paper on either morning.
;
positive;The clubs do run late into the night on the weekends so you may hear noise from them.
;
positive;When we called down to the front desk or picked up our car from the valet, they always addressed us by name.
;
positive;Noticeable if you were awake but was not so bad that I woke up during the night (I'm a very light sleeper).\n-Holds Events.
;
negative;"They charged $30 per person for the most pitiful \""spread\"" I've ever seen."
;
positive;"""The Timbers Hotel property was one of the finest I have stayed at in all the years I have been traveling, over 30 years."
;
positive;Yes, there is one lift and it can be a little slow but it was no hardship.
;
positive;Close to theatre and great restaurants.
;
negative;"She yelled and me and my friends.\nTo sum it up, worst hotel EVER.\nI advise ANYONE to NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
;
negative;It sounded like quite a few people were in there partying it up.
;
positive;The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
;
positive;I could tell It was going to be a great stay.
;
positive;Nice hotel, good location, but absolutely everthing except your room has an extra cost, which if you pay five star prices already is a rip off, wi-fi is $14 for the day and yet starbucks is directly across the road providing it free!.
;
negative;Definitely within walking distance to the Space Needle and only a few blocks to restaurants, the malls/stores downtown, and only a few (drivable) neighborhoods away from the International District.
;
positive;The hotel is very centrally located - from here you can walk very easy along the freedom trail or if you want you can do some shopping, as most shopping areas are in walking distance.
;
positive;\nAll the hotel staff despite the trendy apperance were genuinely helpful and on hand whenever required.
;
positive;The rooms are nice -- slightly larger than other rooms we have stayed in in NYC -- and are very well appointed.
;
positive;One phone call to the desk, and I don't know what that guy said to those people, but within minutes the music was off and the people had gone to their rooms.
;
positive;Overall it was a really good experience.
;
positive;Heat was provided by a small in window unit, but was quite effective.
;
positive;It was great regardless.
;
positive;"But to use it as a base for NASA and for hitting the gulf coast I would highly recommend staying here."""
;
positive;"""Stayed here one night."

positive;Umgebung nicht die beste, daf\u00fcr kann man vieles von dort aus erreichen, und Preis- Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis war sehr gut.
;
negative;"When entered the bathroom in my room there was a \""you-know-what\"" stain on the toilet seat."
;
positive;The restaurant offered a fabulous breakfast buffet each a.m. with an omelet bar and homemade waffles.
;
positive;Do not venture into that area (you would be traveling toward Market Street , check a map) at night.
;
positive;I had a great amount of space.\nAfter unpacking, I headed to the fitness center, which for a hotel was very well appointed and clean.
;
positive;There are definite pluses and minuses for this hotel.
;
positive;The key features: Location and View.
;
positive;Staff were extremely efficient and friendly, went out of their way to be of help eg ordering taxis, suggesting local attractions and eateries.
;
positive;"""I travelled to NYC on business 12th January (1st time in NY) and didn\u2019t arrive at the hotel until after midnight after landing at Newark at gone 11pm."
;
positive;Our room was located right in front of the elevators but we experienced minimal noise from it and no noise from any rooms nearby.\nOur only problem at the Royalton occurred as we were gathering our belongings to leave.
;
positive;You punch in which floor you want to go to on a panel outside of the elevators, and a little screen tells you which elevator to go to.
;
negative;This hotel is very close to the AFB.
;
positive;There were six different types of bagels, two cereals, juices, teas, coffees, and even a selection of croissants and other breakfast cakes.
;
positive;The location is great for shopping, you can just walk up and down the streets and find a lot of good shops.
;
positive;(Unlike many B&Bs, they bring your tray of goodies to you at the time you request!)
;
positive;Freshly updated!
;
positive;"My girl and I have fun making a few on our own, topping it off with the \""rainbow loops\"" besides the usual maple syrup and butter."
;
positive;"\nThe hotel is marketed as somewhat o a \""value\"" hotel-- but the rooms have luxury boutique standards.\nThere are no dining services in the hotel-- but next door is a place that makes outstanding espresso drinks and very good breakfast."""
;
positive;"""I can't say enough about Laura and the rest of the staff at Pier 5."
;
positive;Everyone was helpful, from the valet, to the bellman, to the front desk assistance.
;
positive;"I can't wait for my next trip!"""
;
negative;It was horrible and still itching today.
;
positive;The manager told us that the only reason it's not a 3.5 Star hotel was because they didn't have room service.\nThe kitchen was clean and it had two burners, service for 3, a dishwasher, sink and a full size coffe maker.
;
positive;"\nThe staff was excellent beginning to end.\nNot much to say other than this Four Points did exactly what we were looking for."""
;
positive;"I will probably try staying here again."""
;
positive;Great staff.
;
negative;"This is not a Four Points by Sheraton service I am use to."""
;
positive;The hotel was 20 minutes from Sea World.
;
positive;\nThe rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.
;
positive;"""GOOD\n- Nice, modern design.\n- Great food.\n- Quiet\n- Close to Dupont Circle and restaurants\n- Wine reception in the lobby\n- Friendly people\nBad\n- Long walk or long taxi ride to the business core or attractions\n- Restaurant closed one day for a wedding\n- The sink in the bathroom makes the water splash up all over the place\n- No views\n- Dogs barking in the middle of the night\nUGLY\n- The elevators are horrible."

negative;Au\u00dferdem bekommmt man auch mal live das Kakerlaken-Problem New Yorks mit - irgendwie also ziemlich authentisch.
;
positive;It's not in the main vicinity of Fisherman's Wharf.
;
positive;"We felt very much \""at home\""."
;
positive;The staff that helped us were Augi, Ray, Roseido, Jhon, Georgia, and Melissa.
;
positive;"Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would return."""

;
positive;The hotel was very stylish and clean.
;
negative;"I could go on"""
;
negative;A young man, in a tux, cursed at my husband and kicked our door in.
;
negative;N\u00e3o tinha cofre no hotel, tinha que deixar as malas trancadas e sem seguran\u00e7a.
;
positive;However, the room and especially the bathroom were far from posh (although we had just come from a Westin so the comparison is a bit unfair).\nThe pool was wonderfully large, deep and warm so long as you don't mind being in full view of restaurant patrons at the attached TGI Friday's.
;
negative;He assured me there was no way his staff would have missed the hole and rented out a room in such a state.
;
positive;The rooms were clean and comfortable although I personally found the room a little too cold for my liking (it was was -1 outside) and when the heater was on it would tend to dry out the air in the room causing my friend and I to feel dehydrated and slightly ill.
;
positive;El check-in lo hacen muy r\u00e1pido.\n- Ubicaci\u00f3n: ***** La calle de la derecha es Broadway, subiendo unas calles est\u00e1 Central Park, y bajando unas cuantas calles m\u00e1s est\u00e1 Times Square.
;
negative;Called the front desk and again they informed that the maintenance crew would not be in until Monday.
;
positive;(It was way too cold to go outside this time.)
;
positive;\nThe lobby and shared spaces set the Aloft apart from other hotels.
;
positive;Alles ist zu Fuss erreichbar, direkt um die Ecke von 5th Avenue, MOMA, Central Park etc.
;
positive;The restaurant has some incredible cuisine as well.
;
negative;"""we just got back \nstayed in room 410 the view was a cement wall!\nPool was murky hot tub was awful \nI know it is hard to find a place downtown but i think if you look harder you can do better\nThe one good thing was Steve the parking attendant was helpful"""
;
negative;Twenty minutes later as we were leaving, the coffee cups became available from another unit of the hotel.
;
positive;You can transfer between all elevator banks on the 8th floor, which is often easier and faster than transferring at the lobby or street level.
;
positive;I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are traveling to Houston and want to be near the Galleria area.
;
positive;Traveled on business and my co-worker and I were able to work from the room and utilize the dining room table to work with plenty of space.
;
positive;"Overall, I would absolutely recommend this hotel."""
;
positive;This location being managed by the Four Season raised my expectations even more.
;
positive;For the cost, I expected an average hotel in terms of decor, comfort, and cleanliness, but was very pleasantly surprised to find this place newly remodeled (very cute and modern) and very clean.
;
positive;Pour le petit d\u00e9jeuner un resto brasserie francais se trouve \u00e0 deux pas.

;
negative;"They will have my custom, but not the Icon."""
;
positive;5 minutes from a bus stop that gets you to all the waterside attractions.
;
positive;My wife and I visited the hotel a year before the actual wedding and fell in love with the facility.
;
positive;"A side note: around the corner is one of Washingtons best Irish Bar and Grills, The Dubliner."""
;
positive;Some of the rooms overlook the 59th Bridge and the East River and that is really spectacular.
;
negative;I just know he wasn't part of the cleaning staff.
;
positive;The hotel itself was clean and comfortable.
;
positive;Breakfast buffet was the usual affair, but the food was well cooked and fresh.
;
positive;Her m\u00e5 det ikke r\u00f8res noe for da tar de i utgangspunktet betalt selv om du kun flytter p\u00e5 ting.

positive;I can not remember her name at the moment she was a hispanic female.
;
positive;and the ceiling and reading lights as well as a small fan for air circulation are rheostat-controlled directly above the bed.

positive;El hotel tiene personal de seguridad en la puerta las 24 hs.
;
positive;The rooms are lovely, spacious and well appointed.

;
negative;"""We had previously stayed at the Alexis Park Hotel and had a good time."

;
negative;"I have stayed in a lot of places - this was the worst experience I ever had!"""
;
positive;"""First off the location is fabulous."
;
positive;"Thank you for making being away from home for such a long time more enjoyable!!!"""
;
positive;"With that, in my experience, comes a certain \""hands off\"" attitude from the proprietors."
;
positive;Un' infinit\u00e0 di ristoranti a portata di mano, vorrei segnalarne uno messicano di fianco all ' hotel veramente ottimo.
;
positive;"""Good stuff: rooms were pretty clean, walls were thick enough to avoid hearing your neighbors, staff was VERY friendly and helpful and the bed was AWESOME!!"
;
positive;Best rate we found was on their website and we got a discount for staying more than 3 nights.
;
positive;They made us feel really welcome and were happy to tell us about the area and even greeted me by name the next day.
;
negative;"""Ich bin im Rahmen einer Onlinemarketing-Messe im Hotel La Semana in Manhattan abgestiegen."
;
positive;This hotel is far from those places and not at all convenient.
;
positive;I tagged along with my husband, as he was doing business in NY, and I was never disappointed with the food, drinks, or service at the hotel.
;
positive;My room was nice but there was a unpleasant smell upon entering.
;
positive;Noch ein Tipp: Zum Auschecken kann man seine Koffer in der Lounge f\u00fcr 1 Dollar je Gep\u00e4ckst\u00fcck abgeben, um am letzten Urlaubstag noch zu genie\u00dfen.
;
positive;"""Went to see a cowboys game and spent the night here."
;
positive;However, most were very nice and they were especially responsive to issues which I guess is the most important part.
;
positive;They were a bit slow, but, hey... it was free.\n Overall, the service was very very good.
;
negative;I felt very lost in the busy shuffle and found the service to be awful.
;
positive;"We found it kind of cozy.\nThe staff was helpful as well.\nSTAY HERE !!!"""
;
positive;That's only 2 hours from Phoenix and totally awesome for scenery and hiking.\nLike cheap shopping?

;
negative;Seems they require a two night stay so they did not book the room.
;
positive;(Note: our room was on the end closest to the train tracks/freeway and I heard the train all through the night.
;
positive;We did find that the bathroom could have been given more attention on our first stay, but other than that everything was fine.

positive;There is also no bathroom fan which seems a little weird!!!
;
positive;We've been to DC a number of times but because my parents who are sr citizens were visiting too, we wanted a comfortable hotel in a good neighborhood and this hotel certainly delivered.\nWe tried to check in early at 2pm but we could only get 1 room.

negative;At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds.
;
positive;"Also charging for Wi-Fi needs to be a thing on the past, especially when you can go across the street to a coffee shop for free internet.\nBoth mornings there was absolutely no hot water.\nBottom line, 8=0 and this stay was a 7."""
;
positive;The hotel is on a quiet side street and it is amazing that Time Square is so close.
;
positive;The staff was friendly and helped me navigate around downtown Baltimore.
;
negative;Also a big dirty black mark on the bed covers was spotted right away.
;
positive;"""WJ is a very nice \""boutique\"" hotel in the Theater District."
;
positive;Room decor good, bathroom needed a makeover but nothing to prevent you from staying here - size of the rooms are great.
;
negative;On top of the forgetful service there was a large black hair on top of one omlet - not very appetising.\nStaff on duty were polite but showed no sense of suprise or shock that 2 rooms in a row were uninhabitable and two TVs were not functional in a normal way.
;
positive;Love the simple touches (CD alarm radio with a couple of CDs next to it and the Aveda bath products).
;
positive;The staff were all friendly and helpful.
;
positive;"Only one place to eat in the hotel, but the food was good there also."""
;
positive;"), but got the train from Penn Station on our way back - a much cheaper and \""safer\"" option!!"
;
negative;I had to wait another 3 hours before they would let me in my room, which to my surprise was a non-smoking room.
;
positive;\nThis is not a cookie cutter hotel.
;
negative;When we returned home, my husband called and complained to the priority club company.
;
positive;The staff went out of their way to be helpful: I had an early flight and thought breakfast was just being set-up, I was helped with a couple of selections.
;
positive;"""A nice room on a Monday night in San Francisco is an expensive proposition."
;
positive;So its nice, not timeless.
;
positive;"""We stayed at the Library Hotel while celebrating our anniversary in August 2009, and were blown away by the experience."
;
positive;We got upgraded from a 4-person dorm to our own 2-person room as it was available and the staff thought it would be nicer.
;
positive;I like the fact that they have a kitchen area.
;
negative;She took time to answer questions and truly made the check in experience pleasurable.
;
negative;It was actually outside of the building.
;
positive;The food was fine, but I was not impressed with the service.
;
positive;Wilson is a very friendly and nice bellman who greeted us, asked if he could help.
;
positive;I might return just for another serving.\nIt helps that I had the company to make this trip fantastic, but the setting and service definitely contributed to the experience.
;
positive;If you insist on always showering with your significant other, this might not be the place for you.
;
negative;At the time of check out four days later the bell man found the clothes and they were easy to find in a maid's closet.
;
negative;As a member, I automatically just lined up in that line, only to be completely ignored by the desk clerk.
;
negative;Nice location depending on whether you enjoy constant fire and police alarms, unending din of a foghorn, and last night, of course, loud music from a boat offshore until 2:30 a.m. making the hotel seem like a hostage hostel.
;
positive;I would definitely stay there again.
;
positive;So convenient to have a grocery store across the street and our own kitchen - especially when traveling with kids.
;
positive;The staff was friendly, knowledgable and accessible.
;
positive;the breakfast is very cheap and very worth it (but get there early, we only managed to go once because of the queue - but we were there the same week as a school trip!)
;
positive;The bathroom was spacious and super tidy.\nIf you plan on doing any sort of business there be forewarned.
;
positive;\nPerhaps the main thing that would keep me from staying here is the location.
;
positive;We loved that we could come in a 4 am after parting in the city with kabobs and they even gave us napkins!
;
positive;!\nRooms: they are huge, the biggest we have ever stayed in and this is NYC!
;
positive;We park across the street and paid A FORTUNE!
;
positive;"\nWont be returning to New York but if I did would definetly stay here again."""
;
positive;The room felt like a very cozy bedroom.
;
positive;"""So impressed with the staff - Rachel at the front desk was wonderful (thank you for a warm and cheerful demeanor!"
;
positive;The gym is interesting since it's right by the pool and semi outdoors.
;
positive;I was unexpectedly upgraded to a corner room with a nice sitting area.
;
positive;\nKeurig in the rooms, minibar, no fridge, we had a lovely view on the 14th floor.\nEverything was very nice, not exceptional in any way but very nice.
;
positive;flott betjening.
;
positive;"I would recommend this to anyone and will stay there again."""
;
positive;Restaurant Swingers onder het hotel was tot na middernacht geopend, eten was daar heel goed.
;
positive;We can't wait to return again!
;
positive;"""We used some points I had saved up from a previous business trip--to highlight how expensive this place is, after staying 17 nights in a Marriott hotel elsewhere, I still did not have enough points for two nights at this Marriott and spent $175 to buy the additional points we needed to make up the difference."
;
positive;Nice selection of serve yourself breakfast options...even a Nespresso machine.
;
positive;You won't regret eating here.
;
negative;After going thru several phone calls, faxes and trips to my bank along with not being able to get to my direct deposit pay checks becasue they were being eaten up by NSF charges.
;
positive;We highly recommend purchasing the tickets for the Boston Trolley from Joseph \u2013 it was the best way to see the city!
;
negative;One of those people let our dog out, and none of them would confess to it.
;
positive;"""For any solo traveller wanting and needing to save every dime for a well to do trip, this is the place."
;
positive;The bed was comfortable and the water pressure in the shower good.
;
negative;"This one is near the cross street of Pierce and is to be avoided!"""
;
positive;"""My husband and I recently stayed in the Jungle Nook room at Balboa Park Inn."
;
positive;\nThe front desk staff was very helpful and happy.
;
positive;ZUsammenfassend ist die Lage top!!
;
positive;Little did I know that self parking was the same price.
;
positive;\nI can't say enough about the location.
;
positive;The free cookies at check-in made our day.
;
positive;We really liked the hotel location on the wharf.
;
positive;"here you go.\"" My car was exactly in front where I had left it!"
;
positive;The rooms were clean and service was ok.
;
positive;The rooms are very big by New York standards.
;
positive;"""Extraordinary service and LOVE all of the extras they provide."
;
positive;Allerdings liegt die Zufahrt an einer relativ wenig befahrenen Stra\u00dfe, so dass sich das Problem in Grenzen h\u00e4lt.
;
positive;It was a great room, plenty of space and we really enjoyed having a separate living room area and bedroom area.
;
positive;I like that because a few hotels I stayed at before, previous guests smoked in non-smoking rooms.
;
positive;"I recommend it to save some money and spend more in town."""
;
positive;The room service prices werent that bad though!
;
positive;Stock und man hat eine tolle Aussicht.
;
positive;"Plus it had free wifi if you were willing to hand out your email address and answer a few questions."""
;
negative;It seemed low-class.
;
negative;We sat and watched various drug-dealer and prostitute types running around the street screaming from the bedroom window in the early hours of the morning.
;
negative;The lobby was nice.
;
positive;"""immediate approach is of concrete and glass and cold, but it proved a great business hotel on the boardwalk, good services, spacious rooms, ( no bathrobe or fridge is a bit unusual especially in double upgrade),lovely outdoors , decent bar and restaurant and most important very conveneint to everything"""
;
positive;From arrival to departure, everyone I came in to contact with was superb.
;
negative;Here is what I did not like\n- The Location is on a basically abandoned street next to boarded up buildings encircled by barbed wire fences.
;
positive;"""This is where you want to stay."
;
positive;Romm was clean and the beds are so comfortable, I missed them when I returned home!!
;
positive;The food was very good.

positive;"""Stayed with my family during the first week of March."
;
negative;"""The room I stayed in, 211 had an air conditioning unit just outside the window that was so loud that - not only that I couldn't sleep because of the noise - but you couldn't even hear the TV."
;
positive;We paid 101 through Price line.
;
positive;You can get anywhere easily from the hotel.\nThe room was simple but clean.
;
negative;Housekeeping only came 3 out of the 5 days we were there, and we had to ask for it almost everyday.
;
positive;(When we returned from BBQ that evening, we had done the same thing).
;
positive;La literie \u00e9tait bonne, la propret\u00e9 aussi.
;
negative;However, the suite was located on the 18th floor, right below the pool and locker rooms.
;
positive;They really went above and beyond.
;
positive;good location if you're going for theatre shows, too.
;
positive;The door that could potentially adjoin our room with the next room had a one inch gap at the bottom.
;
positive;"I would highly recommend this place."""
;
positive;V\u00e4nlig och hj\u00e4lpsam personal.
;
negative;Our room had two doors to adjoining rooms through which you could hear everything, and I mean everything, said and done in the adjacent rooms.
;
positive;The lobby was hip, with luxe furniture and a bar off the main lobby.
;
positive;"Wonderful restaurants, such as La Masseria and the famous Carnegie Deli are steps away as is \"" the Soup Nazi \"" of Seinfeld fame!"
;
positive;"""Liegt in der Lower Eastside - also etwas abseits der typischen Touristenherbergen."
;
positive;I don\u2019t know if they were short staff to refill things.
;
positive;"""Hotel Valencia, WOW words cannot Express how Impressed my boyfriend and I was from the time we arrived to the time we departed from your hotel."
;
positive;The bartender already had the closed sign up but was nice enough to give us a round of drinks.
;
positive;We stayed in a suite with three double beds to accomodate all six of us.
;
positive;"We had a little trouble getting the room down to a temperature that was comfortable (I like it \""cold\"" so this will most likely not be an issue for most travelers)."
;
positive;We didn't have a car with us, but there is parking underneath the motel for $10 per day.
;
positive;The room was good sized.
;
positive;We are in the lobby again waiting for the elevator, the doors open to a woman who has luggage and is exasperated.
;
negative;Got back to an elevator on floor 2 and waited another 10 mins!
;
negative;\nCons: no towel racks, no toilet roll holder, poorly installed security chain on door, no peep-hole, broken telephone, no closet or hangers in my room.
;
positive;The Front Office Manager, Nin, went out of her way to find a solution and the result was that we were able to continue our tour.
;
positive;I would have to say the Pro's are the hotel's location, the quality of the service at the hotel and the rooms.
;
negative;The person at the front desk changed our room, which was a little better for the most part.
;
positive;Kind of like that.
;
positive;"""We have stayed at this property before and have always found the hotel to be clean and well taken care of."
;
negative;Not fun with three small children waiting in the car after a long flight.
;
positive;"""I stayed at the Blackstone for two nights while attending a conference at the mammoth Hilton next door."
;
positive;We past a Sheraton but I didn't want to pay $150 or more for quick 8hr stay.
;
negative;I stayed in room 360 and woke in the middle of the night having been bitten very badly.
;
positive;We also used the business center, however I thought the use of the internet should have been gratis (Internet is free from your room if you are a Kimpton InTouch Member-but I did not have my laptop with me).
;
positive;"I recommend an all day pass its like 7 bucks and after 2 rides you basically make your money)\nAll in all this was a fantastic trip and I would not hesitate to suggest this hotel to anyone."""
;
positive;It is also located within a lovely, safe residential area, with 2 different grocery stores a short walk away, making it easy to fill the fridge for breakfast and snacks.
;
positive;"""My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at the Clift Hotel from the 22nd June for 6 nights."
;
positive;"""quick and easy to move around, very efficient service, easy parking on ground level."
;
negative;"""Our first suite smelled of sewer."
;
positive;Et je me retrouve dans un h\u00f4tel de charme \u00e0 la d\u00e9coration incroyable.
;
positive;Our room was on the 9th floor.
;
negative;"The \""everything is bigger in Texas\"" motto certainly didn't apply to the room (normal size, dated curtains, worn carpet, ugly white walls, unevenly worn mattresses on the tiny double beds) or the ridiculously small bathroom (about a 3 inch clearance from the toilet seat to the door when the door is open)."
;
positive;The cleanliness was spot on.\nThe food in the restaurant, bar area and room service was great.
;
positive;Una DJ se contornea al ritmo de la m\u00fasica mientras los ejecutivos reci\u00e9n salidos de sus trabajos apuran sus bebidas.
;
positive;"If you see a good deal to stay in this hotel, I would definitely recommend you take it."""
;
positive;Rooms and bathrooms were small and the decor was a mix of modern and deco.
;
positive;This was pur second time visiting and we will be back next year.
;
positive;Also if you are here for an extended amount of time, there are FREE washers/dryers for guest use ($1.00 for detergent if you don't have your own).
;
positive;In der N\u00e4he gibt es trotz der Lage im Financial District gen\u00fcgend M\u00f6glichkeiten um preiswert und gut zu fr\u00fchst\u00fccken (Tipp: Financier).
;
negative;For instance, our room key didn't work 3 times...and when I went down to the front desk the third time, the girl at the desk said that it was clearly my own fault - that I must be keeping both keys near a cell phone.
;
negative;There were fire trucks and police cars that showed up within minutes of us calling 911.
;
positive;"But it wasn't the reason I said the front desk staff of this hotel had the best customer service; it was the way everyone handled their busy workload."
;
positive;We were booked into the Holiday Inn at Fisherman's Wharf as part of a package deal with Virgin which we probably should have thought about more in advance.
;
positive;They weren't too unpleasant.\nAll in all, a pretty decent hotel for a stay in New York City.
;
positive;Staff were friendly and helpful.
;
positive;Location was also fantastic - you could walk to the Rockerfeller Centre, Grand Central Station and Times Square.
;
positive;The pool is refreshing - love the music - and the new little electric car is a fun addition.
;
positive;"""Perfekte Lage: 1min zu Fuss vom Times Square entfernt und doch (freilich f\u00fcr NYC-Verh\u00e4ltnisse) recht ruhig."
;
positive;The hills!!
;
negative;I told her no & that we would just keep the room.
;
positive;The food was easily 5 star quality.
;
positive;"A geat visit and we would stay there again for sure!"""
;
positive;"It enabled us to bring back shopping mid-day for example.\nOverall, while Manhattan prices mean it will never be considered \""good value\"", this will now be our #1 choice for when we return to NYC."""
;
negative;"""Wir waren letztes Jahr im August f\u00fcr 3 N\u00e4chte zum Start unserer Rundreise in diesem Hotel, da wir den Start mit einem nicht so teurem, verkehrsg\u00fcnstig gelegenen Hotel beginnen wollten."
;
positive;The beach in front of the hotel was never over crowed and we always had a front row seat to some great surfing.
;
positive;), but comfortable and clean.
;
negative;Rude and absurd, uncourteous and unclassy.\nWe ordered breakfast in the room and my $20 waffle had three pathetic strawberries on it and tasted & looked like a stale Eggo.
;
positive;The new part of the hotel is very nice - and like any typical Westin hotel - clean and comfortable.
;
positive;Nice place, nice room, nice bathroom (deep tub and separate shower).
;
positive;was ein unbedingtes Muss f\u00fcr uns als Hotelg\u00e4ste ist, in NY jedoch nicht immer anzutreffen ist.
;
positive;We booked early through an airline's website and saved a substantial amount of money.\nThere is coffee on one floor - I think it is supposed to be 24hr.
;
negative;The service was average and never cared to eat at their hotel restaurant.
;
negative;He was nice but not helpful.
;
positive;The lobby is glamourous--you could probably bring clients there, and make them feel impressed.
;
negative;This was not a big deal but we had one drink and then decided to enjoy a more peaceful evening in our room.\nWhen we got to our room around 10pm, there was a huge party next door.
;
positive;Oh my aching bones were in heaven !!!!!
;
negative;\nMy parents had purchased a night here as a gift to my husband.
;
negative;I walked away after I heard that, very dissappointed.
;
positive;"""Times Square seems like it would come with noisy rooms."
;
negative;Last but certainly not least...
;
positive;This is what separates the W Austin from all other hotels.
;
negative;I showed the manager two calls on my cell phones where I called enroute to NY to let them know we would be arriving late due to traffic backups in the Lincoln Tunnel.
;
positive;Second, their is a peculiar smell in the hallways...has a little tired smell going, best I can describe.
;
negative;"""We checked into The Melrose on Saturday May 26 with plans to stay 2 nights for Memorial Day Weekend."
;
positive;"Will definately stay here again."""
;
positive;\nThe only parking was valet and very expensive.
;
positive;Room was a comfy bed and a shower room.
;
positive;We were pleased to see that it was exactly as we remembered it and one of the best continental breakfasts we have had in any hotel.\nWe are already starting to plan our next trip to Chicago and the Amalfi will again be the only hotel we will consider.
;
positive;Being in a corner far away from the elevator, there also was minimal noise from the corridors.\nThe decor in the room is what you'd expect from any Monaco.
;
positive;It was spacious and comfortable.
;
positive;We had a cot brought up, which was actually a very comfortable bed (vs. a folding cot).
;
positive;The hotel was very clean, updated and quite comfortable and quiet even thought it is located by two interstates.
;
positive;Using the phone in the room, we called down and with in 5 minutes Gustavo came in and got everyone drinks then went and got a nice display of fruit, cheese, vegetables and dips.
;
positive;"""I've stayed in On the Ave twice, the first time in 2001 and the last in 2005."
;
positive;Parking is overpriced as ever and unlike the Hyatt, there didn't seem to be a close alternative.
;
positive;Only downside was an employee entered our room to close a balcony door.
;
positive;"""Big room, big bathroom, nice view, great service, comfy bed... what more could you ask for?"""
;
positive;"""The pool was definitley a plus."
;
positive;The hotel is on the edge of Chinatown, and Little Italy.
;
negative;"""Nos quedamos una noche en este Hotel (o mejor llamarlo Pension de mala muerte) y una y no m\u00e1s.\nUn edificio viejo con mantenimiento p\u00e9simo.\nEl edificio ten\u00eda varias plantas (sin ascensor) con una escalera terriblemente estrecha y deteriorada.\nLa habitaci\u00f3n era diminuta con un cuarto de ba\u00f1o que daba pena.\nEl servicio de desayuno era en dos habitaciones de la primera planta,a las cuales les hab\u00edan quitado los muebles y puesto cuatro mesas del a\u00f1o de la casta\u00f1a.\nDesayuno tipo continental bastante cutre por cierto.\nLo \u00fanico positivo f\u00fae la ubicaci\u00f3n (est\u00e1 a un paso de Time Square).\nEn resumidas cuentas,mejor pagar un poco m\u00e1s antes de estropearte tus vacaciones en este \""Hotel de Psycosis\""."""
;
positive;\nThe rooms are small, with 2 suitcases there wasn't much floor space left, we we'ren't in the room much however so this didn't bother us.\nThe free wireless and washing machines made this hotel excellent value.
;
negative;Surprise!
;
positive;"""My daughter and I stayed here while on Spring Break."
;
positive;\nAmong the unique conveniences is the fact that the parking lot across the street is full of zipcars.
;
positive;"""I come to San Antonio for business and love this bed and breakfast."

positive;"set up the shuttle to and from dinner, which was very convinient."""
;

positive;"Absolut zu empfehlen dieses Hotel."""
;
positive;"""The Hyatt near the airport has spectacular views--even the ones facing the airport."
;
positive;"Thanks Independent- we will be back!"""
;
positive;The best room in Seattle.
;
negative;The pros are: the location, the fact that it has 12 elevators, so you never have to wait for one to arrive.
;
negative;Receptionniste pire que nul, qu'il faut r\u00e9veiller pour avoir un petit-dej.
;
positive;"""From the time we arrived through the time we departed our stay was superb!"
;
positive;The breakfast was simple, but completely adequate.
;
positive;We also had a nice living room with a wood burning stove, an extra murphy bed downstairs, a dining room, a downstairs full bathroom, and an upstairs loft with a bedroom and a bathroom.
;
positive;The hotel lobby really sets the tone for the entire hotel.
;
negative;Nice fitness facility and tennis courts.
;
positive;"Would definitely stay here again."""
;
positive;The staff was great, the location is right downtown, and the price of the room was about 40% less than the other hotels close by.
;
negative;When the room was serviced the shower cap and soap were replaced which I thought was wasteful.
;
positive;They room included a card that you could use to specify what time you wanted maid service--a nice touch if you're staying more than two nights.\nThe A/C unit was reasonably quiet.
;
positive;"""If you know the feeling arriving late at night to a place you've never been, wondering if they really got your reservations, you know how I felt walking into the Drury Riverwalk San Antonio."
;
positive;Again we were told 6.30am.
;
positive;"Otherwise hotel is very good value for money."""
;
positive;(There is not enough space for a roll-away.)
;
positive;Upon arrival, i learned I had received the wrong information and could only apply points on line and not at check in.
;
positive;Nice size, especially for other hotels in the city.
;
positive;"In any event, I got a great night's sleep while I was there.\nOverall, I would recommend this Holiday Inn but I believe other brands have better value for the dollar."""
;
positive;Friendly service and alot of personnal attention!
;
positive;At the front desk there was a small line but what was surprising only 2 desk clerks.
;
positive;Valet parking pretty stout, nearly $40/night.
;
positive;Customer service is great and the rooms are clean and quite.
;
positive;the room was large enough too not feel cramped and the step out balcony was a great benifit.
;
positive;"Highly recommend."""
;
positive;The room we stayed in was nice and clean with really comfortable beds.
;
positive;\nIn the morning, I was even more happy by the serene pool and outdoor patios, an the tasty room service at a great price.\nAfter spending a few hours at this hotel, I was happy to say I would go back.
;
positive;I wish I could remember the man's name who helped us at the front desk, he completely made our trip.
;
positive;"Would recommend!"""
;
negative;The halls were dark and depressing.
;
positive;I liked that the sink was outside the lavatory.
;
negative;"I would not say this place is dangerous; it's just not in the high-rent district to be sure.\nThe grounds look very nice."
;
negative;Which would it be?
;
positive;"We had fun testing out the advertised \""sturdiness\"" of the beds (the fittings over the storage components of the headboard make them a little noisy) and all in all it was a great experience...hopefully the owners complete the renovations of the bathrooms sometime soon for an even more enjoyable stay."""
;
positive;On the internet site, the hotel was showing vacancies.
;
positive;\nI cannot speak highly enough about the staff.
;
positive;"This hotel just keeps getting better."""
;
positive;Very friendly staff.
;
positive;We got a room on the 21st floor - partly due to emailing the hotel requesting a high room as it was our anniversary (nearly).\nRoom was an upgraded superior queen and still quite small compared to others.
;
negative;"""This place is not good I stayed there and had an awful experience I check in and when I got back to my room my grogerys in my fridge were gone thank god thats all I left in there the indian lady there was very rude and all she said was u should not leave there.I had pedilite for my sick 10 month old and soymilk and other juices for my son because my kids were sick and I asked to speak to someone else and she told me there was noone else to speak to only her.They also refuse to give extra towels.She scream at me and all she could say is not my fault u fault.Dont stay here it is truely awful"""
;
positive;The rooms are very trendy with plush pillows and mattress.
;
positive;Staff extremely helpful and friendly.
;
positive;"""Locazione estremamente interessante, vicino Central Park permette di raggiungere a piedi comodamente musei, area shopping come la 5\u00b0 strada."
;
positive;Dealey plaza is well within walking distance (10 minutes tops) and the Zoo is accessible by the Dallas light rail system which has a stop just a few blocks from the hotel.
;
positive;We were graciously accommodated with another room once we realized ours had a view of a rusty building roof.
;
negative;All the money spent on this place goes to furnish the lobby and pay the fancy guy on the street.
;
positive;It was also fantastic because on the morning of the marathon I was able to watch all of the runners cross the finish line.
;
negative;We couldn't get another taxi and the hotel refused to do anything to help us.
;
positive;I had an issue with the vouchers for transport to the pier 91 and this was effectively handled by Mr Nadeem Pirani ( General Manager).
;
positive;The only peeve is that the hot water dispenser had been used at one time for coffee so that coffee flavor permeated my tea.
;
positive;"""We got a pretty good deal on this hotel - usually in the mid $200's a night plus tax, we paid $160 a night after taxes."
;
positive;But will I?
;
positive;"""We just spent a weekend in NY celebrating our 40th anniversary and one of the highlights was our stay at the London NYC."
;
negative;When I found out that the conference was at this hotel I quickly booked the hotel using many of my points.
;
positive;"""Just returned from a special trip to NYC with five other great friends -- three of us graduated from HS together 50 years ago!!!"
;
positive;Anything we asked for, within minutes, we had it.
;
positive;Day and night front desk clerks, front desk supervisor Luis Santiago, bellmen, housekeeping, breakfast room staff truly could not have been friendlier and more helpful!
;
positive;If you go, make sure you say hello to Bonnie - she is a warm, charming concierge that serves the afternoon/evening wine and food.
;
positive;These are updated rooms and offer the most quiet.
;
positive;The breakfast is very good and has good price.
;
positive;"""My husband and I stayed here for a babymoon!"
;
positive;"""Plac\u00e9 en plein centre ville, proche d'une bouche m\u00e9tro, de l'office de tourisme, des arr\u00eats de bus de Market Street, une des plus grandes rues de San Francisco, du terminus d'un cable-car, de nombreux grands magasins et de restaurants, c'est le point de chute id\u00e9al lorsque l'on ne connait pas encore la ville."
;
negative;It was kind of spooky looking in my opinion.
;
positive;\nApart from that I didn't get to see much of the hotel, the event spaces were nice really big and the staff who helped us during our time there were just fab.
;
positive;All gratuity is included which keeps things simple.
;
positive;Perfect location- we were within walking distance to Everything and I mean Everything.
;
positive;At night we had to close the bathroom door.
;
negative;"""This hotel is disgusting."
;
negative;On the 4th we were dropped off by our airport car, baggage unloaded on sidewalk and car drove away.
;
positive;I had requested a quiet room on a high floor which we were duly given.
;
negative;When we tried to discuss the problem with the manager upon check out, honestly expecting some kind of compensation for the lack of an obviously necessary facility, two people from the hotel started yelling at us.
;
positive;Also the woman that did the breakfasts and happy hours was super sweet.\nAlso we were initially bummed about no free wireless in the room, but then found that there was a free business center, with free printer.
;
positive;"""The room was small but was very clean and the king size bed was extremely comfortable."
;
negative;She advised me to wash everything I had brought in hot water and throw my luggage out.
;
positive;Jody the evening bartenter was great.
;
negative;Parking is awfully tight, and they allow big trucks there.

negative;"""Have stayed once before so I thought I knew what to expect."
;
positive;My reservations made through expedia were complete.
;
positive;"I did not use the pool but it looked nice but I imagine you would get some highway noise off of the road.\nThe only think I did not like was the parking garage was a bit of a hike from the entrance."""
;
negative;Instead they called a partner hotel and made us cross the entire city looking for this other hotel that looked cheaper than the Excelsior.
;
positive;Next to it is a small mall that offers a number of restaurants - which is in walking distance.
;
positive;We took the subway to the Cubs and White Sox games.
;
positive;\nThe breakfast area was light and pleasant.
;
negative;\nOn my last stay I got an email from the concierge asking about my stay.
;
positive;"However given my friend had emailed before hand and they had promised her the earth we were a little underwhelmed!\nIf we ever return to New York we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, as we really enjoyed our stay here."""
;
positive;The bathroom was great as was the shower.
;
positive;We were given a handi-capped room which was a very nice size for a NYC hotel.
;
positive;"I have stayed at other VALUE hotels in the city and will never again stay anywhere but at the Cosmopolitan!!"""
;
positive;It is right on the cable car line and 2 blocks from Union Square.
;
positive;"We passed on the $19 breakfast buffet, opting for takeout from the many coffee and pastry shops nearby."""
;
negative;Forced 02 dollar chargings to every case or box you need help taking to the room.
;
positive;The hotel in general had a lovely atmosphere, neither pretentious nor spartan, very balanced and pleasing in every way.
;
positive;The only drawback is that they are on two levels, and the only bathroom is upstairs.
;
positive;Payed $38.
;
positive;Un jaccuzi est \u00e9galement accessible.
;
positive;The beds were comfortable and my wife is picky when it comes to beds.
;
positive;Yes, I know that all these things are finely tuned marketing ploys, but it never once felt like that.
;
positive;The front desk staff was very friendly and attentive as well.
;
negative;THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION.
;
positive;for toiletries.
;
positive;"I would certainly return."""
;
positive;"""This hotel doesn't have a lot of useless frills, but it has all the really important frills, like free Internet access, spacious rooms, comp breakfast, and an evening \""cookie bar.\"" What really impressed me were the staff."
;
positive;"La limpieza de los cuartos esta acorde a su nivel.\nSin dudas, es un hotel para recomendar y volver"""
;
negative;\nI dropped off the key to the guy at the front desk and told him we couldn't stay.
;
positive;The hotel has a great location (if in a bit more quiet part of town) but is within walking distance to the bustle of shopping and restaurants and an easy cab ride pretty much anywhere else you need to go.\nThe hotel itself is very nice inside with a modern interior and large lobby.
;
positive;Staff was kind and helpful.
;
positive;The hotel appeared brand new except for the outdoor pool area which had been updated but you could tell they hadn't redone the lining.
;
positive;Some of these reviews have complained about the size of the rooms, but for our purposes, it was quite comfortable.
;
positive;the lovely looking sinks in which it's virtually impossible to wash!)
;
positive;We had biscuits and gravy, eggs, waffles.
;
positive;The location is very convenient.
;
positive;"xx"""
;
negative;They tried to move us to another room that looked just as dark and dusty.
;
positive;They are an experience.
;
positive;That said, the rooms are small, the hot water runs to extremes (too hot, then cold, then too hot again), and there were some strange sounds that woke us at night (pings in the heat or plumbing).
;
negative;When management was made aware of the problems, nothing was done other than to offer a half-hearted apology.\nOn Sat.
;
positive;Let me begin by saying that Boston is one of the greatest cities I've traveled to.
;
positive;The bathroom was about average sized, but was long and narrow with lots of unusable space in the back (see pic) possibly because it was near the edge of the building.
;
positive;That really impressed me.
;
positive;"Would definitely return to this hotel in the future!!"""
;
positive;We had a nice room with 2 small double beds.
;
positive;You are on the water and there is a lot of green space around you.
;
negative;"The front desk clerk was extremely rude when I asked to exchange rooms because it was too loud he told me \""that is your opinion\"" The bed very old and uncomfortable and I probably slept 3 hours due to tossing and turning."
;
positive;"If you can oversee the age it will make up for comfort and professionalism."""
;
positive;The gym is great and you can use it even if you are staying at another hotel (which I did).
;
positive;It was like having a local guide concerige-advisor - all in one.
;
negative;"While laying on the bed we kept hearing a humming noise that at times was on the \""quieter\"" side but then would would get louder - this went on he whole time we were there!"
;
positive;BTW, Starbucks coffee is provided every morning in the lobby.
;
negative;\nWe should have checked out.
;
positive;The beds were so comfortable.
;
positive;People may feel uncomfortable walking around behind the hotel alone at night.
;
positive;the resturant attached to the hotel max's on the square is quite expensive it cost 20.00 for breakfast, just across the road is leftys that is good and cheap too.
;
positive;Twin room we stayed in was, I thought, a good size given my expectation that in NYC space would be tight, and given the price.
;
positive;No big deal.
;
positive;We like Residence Inns and this one did not disappoint.
;
positive;"\nLast, I'd like to leave a compliment for the staff who kept the coffee pot by the restaurant filled with hot, fresh coffee every morning and for the lovely waitress who so unobtrusively kept my cup full every morning when we all went in to breakfast."""
;
positive;It also had a bar.\nIt was good value for money, great room, staff, just wrong location.
;
negative;"It's ridiculous that they allow people to flaunt the \""no smoking\"" rule.\nAside from that, we had access to the executive club on the upper level, with free hors d'oeuvres and open bar in the evenings and free buffet breakfast in the mornings."
;
negative;"""My sons and I were traveling back from a baseball tournament in coral springs and stopped here at midnight."
;
positive;\nI needed some help finding my way around the city at first and the front desk person took out a map and highlighted it along with some food suggestions and the like.
;
negative;The pillows are lumpy and uncomfortable--I bought my own.
;
positive;Without exception, during the rest of our stay he handled everything.
;
positive;If you are staying in San Francisco you could not want for a better hotel.
;
positive;The Location was great.
;
positive;"""I have stayed in Hotels in Memphis 4 - 5 nights every week for the last 4 months."
;
positive;The staff are friendly and helpful.
;
positive;I ended up hitting a great but cheap Thai place called Bangkok on Powell twice in 3 days.
;
positive;I get lucky most of the time on Priceline and get this hotel.
;
negative;My wife and I got no rest whatsover!!
;
positive;Housekeeping still came back to sort my room out that afternoon.
;
negative;We waited about 30 minutes, but nothing happened.
;
positive;The room was a little worn but clean, spacious and comfy.
;
positive;"""My friend and I stayed at the Muse during our recent girls trip to NYC."
;
positive;Absolutely loved this hotel.
;
positive;"We asked for a cot at 2am, but they gave a larger room with double beds at no extra cost.\nFinally, you can\u2019t possibly beat this location; a block from Union Square and walking distance to Nob Hill and China town."
;
positive;No escuchamos para nada el ruido de los trenes de la central station.
;
negative;I won't waste my money.
;
positive;Pleased to see an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe though the room safe did not work.
;
positive;They have switched to the shampoo and conditioner dispensers.
;
positive;Of note, the honor bar lock did not lock and there was no in room coffee maker (I need a morning cup!
;
positive;The first night was with the bride in her suite and everyone was extremely accommodating to all of our requests that night and the day of the wedding.
;
positive;No problem.
;
positive;It is a short walk to the trolley which takes you to Old Town and other popular destinations in minutes.
;
positive;"We would definitely stay at the Casablance and would also recommend it to our friends and family."""
;
negative;This necessitated a long drawn out negotiation with the hotel about returning the money and compensating us for the inconvenience and embarrassment caused.
;
positive;Herlig \u00e5 slappe av med vin i lobbyen n\u00e5r man var innom hotellet for \u00e5 slappe litt av f\u00f8r en ny byrunde.
;
positive;The only drawbacks were the internet service in the hotel was very slow and it would have been nice to have an activity room for the teens to hang out in at night.
;
positive;"I will never stay anywhere else while in Indy."""
;
negative;Guess what?
;
positive;Am sensitive to noise and this hotel was very quiet.
;
positive;"""the staff was always happy and willing to help."
;
positive;The size of the rooms are generous by NYC standards and are very well priced.
;
positive;Each evening we walked down there for dinner or dessert.
;
positive;Since we had a later flight, after check out at 11am, it was really appreciated to have the use of the pool and the spa to freshen up before leaving for the airport.
;
positive;We were in the smallest room they offer, called the studio I believe, and one of the rooms with no view.
;
negative;Not for families are girls getaway.
;
positive;"""My husband and I enjoyed a getaway weekend to the Adolphus."
;
positive;Room was a little loud facing Mason, but it's a city.
;
positive;This trip we brought my mother in-law since she has always wanted to see Graceland.
;
positive;You are in the theater district in less than 10 minutes (4 stops)!
;
positive;"""This is a well run Marriott property just off of I-10 North."
;
positive;I would recommend the king room over the queen for the slight extra price.
;
positive;\nWithin walking distance of the Rockefeller centre, Times Square, Grand Central Station and the Empire and many more.
;
positive;The Dupont Residence Inn is like my second home, so I don't notice some of the frayed-around-the-edges issues that seem to bother some other reviewers.
;
positive;We loved having breakfast in our room, sitting at the window looking out at the park.
;
negative;"""STAY AWAY."
;
positive;The lobby is expansive and usually fills up quickly at night with party-goers sashaying around flaunting their designer clothing.
;
positive;Les services sont nombreux et de qualit\u00e9 (prix un peu \u00e9lever pour le service de pressing).
;
positive;"I would not stay anywhere else when in Washington DC."""
;
positive;We really enjoyed the full breakfast each morning.
;
positive;Rooms were quite big for DC standards (compared to the other hotels that we have stayed at in DC) and very comfortable.\nThe best part was that we were given a complementary bottle of champagne which I think was because I mentioned that this was a romantic outing for me and my wife.
;
positive;I agree with other reviewers about the age of the furnishings but that didn't bother us because it was neat and clean (I.e., leather headboard peeling, kitchen needs an update) I'll take a clean bathroom over modern furnishings any day if I had to pick.
;
negative;This is my second time to stay here and the second time I've experienced loud hallway parties.
;
positive;Go to Astro Gallery of Gems on 34th if you want to see awesome mineral specimens.
;
positive;"""Rooms are nice."
;
negative;Then he had the houskeeping manager call to apologize, and again offer me a free night's stay.
;
positive;"Flatscreen TV and Bose stereo.\nThe only issue I had at all was not even hotel related; after I parked my rental car right outside of the hotel a couple of sketchy guys kind of lurked around."
;
positive;It looked exactly like the pictures onthe internet.
;
positive;But you do have to use a room key in the elevators and maybe they have cameras all over the place.
;
positive;I had forgotton my toothbrush and they supplied me with one including toothpaste FOC on the spot.
;
positive;We could see the Empire State Building from the hotel window since we were on one of the higher up levels.
;
positive;"""Every hotel is better, even much better, if you stay there often enough to figure out what you want from the hotel, and to communicate to the staff what you want."
;
positive;"""I liked this hotel a lot."
;
positive;"\nThe \""bedbugs\"" problem scared us actually, and we could not cancel.\nFinally, everything was perfectly ok. \nIt is perfectly situated, clean, very simple."
;
negative;"""I'm grateful my stay here was free."
;
positive;"""I had the pleasure of staying here recently for a conference."
;
positive;You will be close to Little Italy, SoHo, the West Village, Chinatown and a short cab ride to Brooklyn Heights across the Brooklyn Bridge.
;
negative;I have no idea what was going on but it went on for a very long time and no one seemed to do anything about it.
;
positive;\nWhen we booked in they had upgraded our room and they made sure to remind us of the free reception downstairs.
;
positive;"Next morning had an excellent relaxed continental breakfast that had everything we wanted, went for a fantastic walk down the Venice Canal (only a few paces from the hotel) and back down the beach).\nThe hotel is odd in that each part - room, location, breakfast, staff is a bit ordinary but the sum of them produces a really nice place to stay in"""
;
positive;Good price, plus a discount using AAA.
;
positive;I thought that was odd, but again, not a big deal.
;
positive;Great simple free breakfast and staff were very friendly.
;
positive;Nice clean and well presented hotel with friendly staff.
;
positive;For example, they ask you if you would like a late \ncheck out and do not charge extra, knowing that you might be catching \na late flight.\nThe rooms are divine and all come with a balcony with a view at the \nfront of hotel that overlooks the city with The Hills in the background.\nHotel ameneties come no better than the fourth floor spa/gym/pool \ncomplex.
;
positive;You know, the kind you can open and look through!!?
;
positive;Unlike many hotel buffets, the food actually tasted!
;
negative;NOT.
;
positive;I ordered room service at 11:55 (closed at midnight) and had no issues and that service was just as good.
;
positive;"We look forward to a return stay Element Houston Vintage Park"""
;
positive;Full kitchen, huge living room, 1-full bath with whirlpool tub and another half bath!!
;
positive;Also, I forgot my laptop so I don't know how great the free wifi is.
;
negative;Website claims this is a suite hotel with fridge, kitchen etc in room - not in our rooms!
;
positive;It is located a short walk from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the underground train system.
;
positive;When one of my children clogged up the toilet, a staffer was at our door with a plunger within three minutes of my call, and graciously dealt with the problem, so gracious, you'd think we'd done him a favor by calling.
;
positive;The other thing was the elevator was slow and only one was working.
;
positive;The pool and outdoor desk area offfered great views, however the outdoor desk is not very useful in December, unless you dress in layers.
;
positive;You must go to Woodbury Common Outlets first to do your shopping.
;
positive;The nicely equipped laundry, with large machines and tables, was in the basement near several resort offices.
;
positive;It is well maintained with a good staff, attractive plantings outside, and a well stocked deli/convenience store on site.
;
positive;And if you want to use the sound system, you'll need to bring CD's since there is virtually no reception in the room for AM/FM channels.
;
positive;Hj\u00e4lpsam och trevlig personal.
;
positive;The hotel is exceptually clean, and the staff goes out of thier way to help.
;
positive;I'm just not a big fan of midtown.
;
positive;"\nPool area is small."""
;
positive;There are quite a few restaurants within walking distance.
;
negative;The result of this was that we had no place to sit or walk around in the room as our suitcases were either on the one chair or on the floor.
;
positive;"""The location of this hotel was great."
;
negative;\nI made a reservation at the Doubletree Metropolitan (wonderful hotel BTW that I have stayed at several times) that night and left early the next morning.
;
positive;The location is perfect since it is right by polk street.
;
positive;\nLady Gaga recently came to Phoenix to strut her stuff.
;
positive;"The beds were very comfortable and overall we were pleased with this hotel."""
;
positive;"We will definately stay again."""
;
positive;The front desk did ask if we wanted a view of the highway that was noisy or a quiet room with a view of the hill.
;
negative;\nOne of the perks advertised was a daily newspaper deliverd to our door.
;
positive;"""This hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance of all the major downtown attractions."
;
positive;Perfekte Lage f\u00fcr Leute, die das erste Mal in NY sind, denn man kann vieles erlaufen (Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building UND 248 Broadway Theatres!
;
positive;"""Stayed here for our anniversary, had a \""suite location\"", nice rooms."
;
negative;Our room was not yet cleaned from the night before.
;
negative;There is also a weird magnifying mirror hanging right in front of the bathroom mirror and it is quite annoying.
;
positive;It felt like a room I was renting in someone's home in Europe.
;
positive;\nIf you want to visit Little Italy or Chinatown for dinner, both are also within easy walking distance of the hotel.\nThe staff at the front desk were great.
;
positive;It feels like there is a DJ and beautiful people with cocktail in hand in every room and there is a good buzz about the place.\nBut it is not cheap!
;
positive;I'm guessing because of my tardiness, and that most other reservations had already checked in, however, the young lady at the desk, CALLED ME BY NAME as she welcomed me to the hotel.
;
positive;"""I recently travelled to New York for a week for work, two weeks after Hurricane Sandy had hit the city."
;
positive;The Grant Hotel is located in an excellent, central location of downtown San Francisco.
;
positive;"""sono appena tornata da new york per le vacanze di natale ... l hotel e' fantastico avevo paura perche' non aveva recensioni ma in 30 min sei a time square a piedi in 10 a little italy e nolita(per lo shooping) in 2 alla fermata della metro ,in 5 nella zona piu' ricca di ristoranti il greenvillage.... le camere sono pulite e comode , la colazione buona ... e il personale e' molto gentile e disponibile ... alla sera quando torni stanco per la giornata fredda e lunga loro ti accolgono con biscotti caldi appena sfornati .... quindi consiglio alla grande questo hotel"""
;
positive;But the hotel is not to be blamed.
;
positive;The units aren't those older under the window things but are operated with a thermostat.
;
negative;Used the equivalent of two round trip tickets plane tickets to to Rome for a two night stay.
;
positive;Right across the street from Balboa Park, which houses the Zoo and some great museums (Every Tuesday a few of the park's museums offer free admission -- the museums rotate, so check the Balboa Park website.)
;
negative;Engineering said it was a battery issue and replaced it.
;
negative;Happened twice to us and our friends.
;
positive;The staff was warm and welcoming.
;
negative;Wow!
;
negative;We only used one coupon and returned to the hotel.\nThe breakfast next morning was also mediocre.
;
positive;Very nice.
;
positive;It is exactly how I felt.
;
positive;We got up there early so there weren't many people.
;
positive;Location is very convenient to highway and has multiple restaraunts close by to eat.
;
negative;It is very far from downtown.
;
positive;"Really, they bend over backwards to get you where you need to go."""
;
positive;Just stayed one night at the beginning of our trip and one night at the end but both nights were perfect.
;
positive;"""I stayed here 3 nights while attending a meeting at the resort."
;
negative;"The hotel does have a super concierge and give you plenty of clean towels!"""
;
positive;"I was quite comfortable staying here.\nLocation is a bit of a challenge; it is a beautiful location tucked in the middle of the bay, but it is somewhat inconvenient if you want to be able to walk anything."
;
positive;Coffee and Muffins are complimentary in the morning.
;
negative;Late at night and unfamiliar with the setting, I discover there's no signage on the hotel.
;
positive;And you're just a hop, skip and a jump away from the bustle of Times Square.
;
positive;Every member of staff we encountered was courteous and helpful.The check in was busy when we arrived so we were directed to the direct reception area - where we were told we could move to a superior room to what we had booked.
;
positive;I don't know about room service, but there is a food court in the lower level where you can buy quick food from overpriced Starbuck's coffee to a great Potbelly's sandwich, burgers from Five Guys and few others like that.
;
positive;"It is perfect for one location weddings with plenty of space and a nice location near the airport."""
;
positive;The living area had a pull out sofa sleeper.
;
positive;We liked the direct bayside beach access.
;
positive;Das manko an diesem hotel ist einzig die preise f\u00fcr das parken von 32 bzw.
;
positive;Several times, we rode the elevator with employees, and they made conversation and asked how we were enjoying the hotel.\nAnywhere on the Riverwalk, plan ahead on parking.
;
positive;"""Estive hospedado no hotel entre os dias 04/02/2011 e 09/02/2011."
;
positive;Finally, the room was not ready until 4:15 pm.
;
positive;To park your vehicle in their garrage was a little pricey, but that was my only gripe.
;
positive;the lap pool is nice but not condusive to family swims, and seems like some adults there for a serious swim were annoyed by kids in the pool.
;
positive;We also visited the Spa.
;
negative;We found a prepaid package deal directly through the hotel so we didn't have to pay for it while we were down there, sounds like a good idea right?
;
negative;They charge $42/day for parking in their parking garage which is almost 3x as much as parking a half block away at PMI (Parking Management Inc.) for $16/day...plus PMI offers early bird specials--$10/day if you park by 9:30am.\n***My room was comfortable but it did not have a microwave or a refrigerator.
;
positive;!\nService irr\u00e9prochable... Propret\u00e9 des chambres au Top !
;
positive;"Overall great trip and stay!"""
;
negative;It wasn't worth arguing about since we arrived late in the evening.
;
negative;"The drunken, falling guys in the lobby area one night make this apparent as well as the lack of seriousness in upkeep of this hotel."""
;
positive;Lots of good restaurants around Dupont Circle.
;
positive;The Hotel itself has a very nice, wide open lobby and pleasant little bar area.
;
positive;The lobby atrium was pleasant as was the bar.
;
positive;"\nPickup from the airport was prompt and we made additional use of their shuttle to the light rail.\nWe all enjoyed the beautiful grounds in the morning prior to leaving for the airport."""
;
negative;There was no where to put bathroom toiletries, no shelf at all in the bathroom.
;
positive;"""Truly a unique hotel....friendly, helpful staff from the valet, to front desk, to concierge...Loved the cocktail hour...and coffee in the am...Definitely would stay here again!"
;
negative;A savings of over 200.00.
;
positive;I knew the hotel had an indoor pool and fitness room which were both very nice.
;
negative;I\u2019m not a fan of unsupervised children, and when I\u2019m trying to work out I don\u2019t want any distractions.
;
positive;That kinda stuff does not usually bother me, but that district is pretty rough.
;
negative;Take a message for the morning.
;
negative;Hotel has potential...great location!
;
negative;"Stay away from that place, even outside look shows how bad it is."""
;
positive;"""Our stay was for 7 nights and the level of service from the staff was memeorable, you are not too far from everything and the town car service the hotel provides is reliable and very friendly drivers who are prepared to go the extra mile to show you around."
;
positive;I guess this is a good thing?
;
positive;For the location, ammenities and service, I can't say enough great things about this hotel.
;
negative;"They claim to have a shuttle that takes you downtown, but was \""conveniently\"" not running on the weekends."
;
positive;Already planning our next trip back and will definatly stay here again without hesitation.
;
positive;\nWe ate breakfast at the hotel's restaurant one morning.
;
positive;Quiet A/C.
;
positive;"""me and my partner were visiting the usa for the first time from the UK , and chose venice beach and the Cadillac for what appeared to be its bohemian and laid back vibe .We were not dissapointed and loved the place .we had an appartment suite lookinfg direclty onto the boardwalk , with all the hustle and bustle that entails .We were so close to the beach , i could almost dip my ttoes in the ocean .TRhe ec;ectic mix of people along the boardwalk , and the proximity to the beach made this a perfect holiday for uds , and i would not hesitate to return"""
;
negative;\nMoral of this story- don't stay there!
;
positive;"""As background, I find Mr. Trump almost intolerable--- rude, ignorant, in a way, everything bad about America rolled up into one egomaniacal buffoon."
;
positive;"""Stayed here for three nights in October 2011."
;
positive;with a series of bridges and waterfalls, it is beautiful.
;
positive;But as far as restaurants, there are plenty more nearby and it's also two blocks away from Ghirardelli where you can get chocolates and ice cream (as well as food).There are many shops nearby, including a Walgreens just a block away for basic needs (you can also buy souvineers there for a much cheaper price -- this advise was given by a front desk staff).
;
positive;Any requests for towels or shampoo was fulfilled very quick.
;
positive;The decor was a bit dated but to be honest it was only somewhere to sleep for 4 nights as we spent most of our time out.
;
negative;\nThe TV system was antiquated (as was the TV) and was far below par.
;
positive;It doesn't, however, have any bells or whistles - I certainly wouldn't rank it with boutique hotels like Dominion 1912 in Quebec.
;
positive;Oh, and the use of the lock on the door was strange - the housekeeping staff luckily came by as we were struggling and showed us how to do it.
;
positive;Check-in was quick.
;
negative;"""The location is decent and close to Broadway shows."
;
positive;Was there to see the ducks and did just that.
;
positive;"""Took the family down DC for a quick weekend getaway."
;
positive;\nI sometimes come to San Francisco for fun, not work, and after staying here I think I would rather spend $149 a night to stay here than to use my frequent guest points and stay at the St. Francis for free.
;
positive;Near shops and restaurants.
;
positive;The best deals I could find online other than that were about 85 bucks.
;
negative;On the day we left, we had to get a cab to the airport at 5:30am so we asked for a wake-up call that never came.
;
positive;We took a few excursions north of San Diego and getting there was breeze due to this location.
;
positive;Other options include yogurts, cereal, hot meat and egg dishes, juices and so on.
;
positive;Housekeeping does a superb job, the rooms and the bathrooms are so CLEAN!!
;
positive;"""Checked in around 9:30pm and was out early the next morning for a flight from LAX."
;
positive;\nAs I said, it is an older hotel, and the room furnishings are old also, but if you look at the inlaid wood work that went into making all of the matching bed, dressers, etc you will know that it was all hand-made and expensive in it's time.
;
positive;The hotel also has a somewhat expensive restaurant - Russos, serving breakfast & dinner.
;
positive;She was very flexible and patient with our last-minute changes and was able to give us a rate within our budget.
;
positive;I asked to be switched and was told only the Presidential Suite was available at an additional $189.00.
;
positive;It makes for a mess around the pool hallways, and distance from elevator is long haul with luggage to room.
;
positive;"""The hotel is perfectly centered in the heart of Charlotte uptown."
;
positive;"No food or drink after 12:30 was the only problem."""
;
positive;"Pleasant service."""
;
positive;"Understand that later in the year some of the facilities will be upgraded, including the provision of flat screen TVs."""
;
positive;We are lodging operators ourselves and it is amazing what people expect (especially those in the 23-34 year old range as evidenced by earlier reviews of this hotel) and what they can find to complain about.
;
positive;This is not the place to stay if you want luxurious or large Washington accommodations.
;
negative;"""Booked thru a convention site."
;
positive;It is modern, super clean, warm and inviting.
;
positive;"great food in bar lounge on lobby floor of hotel.\n+ comfortable beds, new flat screen tv, free wifi, refreshing water in lobby and nice food at bar lounge, great gym with cardio & weights, swimming pool with deckchairs, towels, some pool items provided like long floatation (noodles)\n- dusty desk and rubbish behind desk area, more ply in toilet paper, recycling system would be good and so would a mini bar fridge"""
;
positive;Such a great place and I can't imagine why more people don't know about it.
;
positive;"""Everyone was very helpful from the front desk to the valet etc."
;
positive;Helpful concierge.
;
positive;I'm glad we decided to pay the fee.
;
positive;"My only complaint is that we weren't there long enough!"""
;
negative;We had to turn on the heater to warn things up, but it was so dusty and dirty that I started sneezing and getting stuffed up.
;
positive;If there is a convention the elevators and bar area can get a little overwhelmed.\nThe staff goes out of their way to make sure you have what you need.
;
negative;I told the clerk that we were not stqying there due that there were bed bugs.
;
positive;Be prepared to take a while for breakfast, service is good but not very fast.

positive;Ici rien n\u2019est laiss\u00e9 au hasard, Chaque chambre arbore egalement une technologie de pointe, est \u00e9quip\u00e9e d\u2019une baignoire et d\u2019un douche.
;
positive;"We normally stay in the Holiday Inn along the road but have stayed in other Fisherman Wharf hotels and if you are planning on making the most of the San Francisco nightlife and only want somewhere to stay that is clean then this is worth considering."""
;
positive;Enjoyed the gym and spa.
;
positive;Tienen un caf\u00e9 de cortes\u00eda y un drink por la tarde.
;
positive;I thought the room wasn't quite as clean as it should be.
;
positive;It was in a great central location and we walked from North Beach back to the hotel and then on to Union Sqare all in one night.
;
positive;Certainly not for the food or for amenities.
;
positive;The staff were lovely and would help you with anyone thing you need.
;
positive;"""I was here for a business meeting in late Sept."
;
positive;I had the best night's sleep ever in a hotel.
;
positive;Breakfast was basic but in a nice enough setting.
;
positive;Trust me.\nNever used the pool, although it looked really nice and could be used well in the summer months.\nCouple of corks, no space in the bathroom to put personal items.
;
positive;Everything was PERFECT!
;
positive;It was very clean, there wasn't any visable mold, but the mildew smell was dominent.
;
negative;Our bathtub also leaked substantially.
;
positive;The rooms were clean and spacious, and the people we dealt with were helpful.\nWe did not sample the hotel's breakfast.
;
negative;"\nI reported it to the hotel, and they denied it came from my room.\nIt is not worth the risk to stay here!"""
;
negative;Our rep was brusque and not as pleasant as the previous one.
;
positive;"But As long as you don't go out at 1AM looking for cigarettes, then life is good."""
;
positive;There's top-notch food within walking distance, and the Museum of Modern Art is literally next door.
;
negative;Had moldy shower curtains and needs updated comforters- not a beautiful room.
;
positive;It was tastefully decorated.
;
positive;"One is literally 10 ft away from the door the other about two blocks and It takes you to the main terminal."""
;
positive;Be advised breakfast is from 6-10 and they end exactly at 10.

positive;"""I stayed at The Buckingham Athletic Club for a couple days and had a great experience."
;
negative;the money was in a suitcase, in a wallet.
;
positive;"It seems to get an older crowd and it's not a W by any means, but it's not trying to be.\nIf you need additional info, please contact me:\n[-]"""
;
positive;One thing I like about this hotel is it is not a cookie cutter Courtyard.
;
positive;Do get to the 2nd floor for the free buffet breakfast before 9AM, no later than that because you can still get your food and get a table before the rush!
;
positive;"""L'hotel a \u00e9t\u00e9 refait \u00e0 neuf r\u00e9cemment, les chambres sont nickels, de plus, ils proposent un petit d\u00e9jeuner complet, ce qui est rare \u00e0 NY."
;
positive;I do have to list some concerns.
;
positive;We really lucked out.
;
positive;The pool is OK, nice size but no real shallow area for kids about 2-3.
;
positive;"\nTruly a really nice hotel."""
;
positive;"""It was a pleasure staying here."
;
positive;Mini-fridge was big enough for 3 small pizza boxes plus water bottles.
;
positive;Everything you need is within a few blocks.
;
negative;And the breakfast area was probably once a meeting room.\nThe worst problem is the elevator.
;
positive;"""My daughter is interested in attending the University of Washington, so she and I visited Seattle in April and stayed at the Watertown."

positive;The view was spectacular !!!

positive;"""We stayed two nights in a suite in this hotel."

;
positive;We chose to go to Cafe Duke two doors down - it is amazing!
;
positive;"""Myself and my partner stayed in the Hilton Garden Hotel back in Janaury, (forgive the late review!)"
;
positive;"\nThe restaurant is a great place for a drink to enjoy the view, but the dinner prices were a bit steep for what was served.\nFemale staff were more than helpful - males behind the front desk needed a shake up - were of little help"""
;
negative;Then my husband got irrate and called them back.
;
positive;\nWhen we checked out again it only took 5 mins and they offered us a room to store our bags while we waited to go to the airport.
;
positive;"dalle tariffe appese in camera, sembrava abbastanza caro, ma sicuramente ne valeva la pena!"""
;
positive;The biggest plus is that the staff is wonderful.
;
positive;This time, my room was even-numbered, facing Forest Park Blvd.
;
positive;They have black out curtains.
;
negative;Better to stay nearer midtown if you're doing the tourist things.
;
positive;My first stay was in April at Homewood Suites - see my review.
;
positive;"""Francsico Bay Inn was one of the better deals in the Fisherman's Wharf Area."
;
positive;Only thing missing is that it didn't have a mini-refrigerator, but it did have a room safe that had enough room for a wallet, a purse, a GPS and two ipads.
;
positive;We were in one of the corner rooms with a view of the lake and the pier.
;
positive;"\nThe staff is always very kind and actually remember my name when I return.\nGreat service and I continue to use this hotel and will in the future."""
;
positive;Beautiful style.
;
positive;One annoying thing was that housekeeping knocked on our door as early as 8am.
;
positive;"""I had a terrific experience at this hotel."
;
positive;There's a Walgreens nearby and a deli if you're hungry, and you can get a cab easily on Geary Street.
;
positive;\nThe lobby is beautiful and the 1886 Cafe in the lobby is beautiful.

positive;Having stayed there 3 years ago we knew that the higher you are on the north tower the better the view.
;
positive;The hotel staff was very friendly towards our group and I am thinking about looking into becoming a member since I am in the downtown area all the time.
;
positive;Everyone is very pleasant and helpful.
;
positive;Very chic....nice American fare, and presented very beautifully.
;
negative;So i was OK at that point.
;
positive;The room was perfect for our family of 5, the pool was great, we were with in walking distance of many things, and the valet parking was priceless.
;
positive;The location was ideal for the Art Institute (1.5 blocks away) and the park, Michigan Avenue, and State Street.
;
negative;"There were never enough towels."""
;
positive;The other room was river view one at 14th floor.
;
positive;The lobby of the hotel looks like a large bus station or airport terminal with lines often forming at the reception.
;
positive;All public areas are amazing.
;
positive;We were on the 10th floor and the street noise was noticeable at times but not a major problem.
;
positive;Looking at chart near elevator there are only 6 rooms per floor.
;
positive;"""The room was spacious, modern and chic."
;
negative;It is close to all of the attractions and the main highway.
;
negative;The car is a total loss but I felt that it should not have happened if the hotel was doing their job.
;
positive;There was also an abundance of nice toiletries and lots of towels!
;
positive;We were upgraded, by virtue of being Marriott rewards members, to a harbor view room.
;
positive;They also offer pomegranate hair conditioner.\nThe hotel has two popular restaurants.
;
negative;"Fortunately, I \""comprende\"" and understood this insult."
;
positive;It seemed like a nice enough place that it should have had a restaurant, which is too bad given El Paso's dismal dining options.
;
positive;The staff were super helpful and friendly.
;
positive;Breakfast was good.
;
positive;"Our room was directly across from the elevator, but we heard neither the elevator nor other guests.\nI would highly recommend the hotel."""

negative;"The next night desk manager said \""Maintenance doesn't work at night.\""\nThe carpet needs to be replaced to remove a couple of cigarette burns.\nThe WiFi was too slow to be useful.\nOn the bottom floor, we could hear every step taken in the room and hall way on the second floor."""
;
positive;We paid $199 a night and we thought the hotel was a great value for NYC.
;
positive;EVERY single hotel employee seemed to have our best interest at heart.
;
positive;Although I didn't use the airport shuttle, the front desk representative let me know that it was available and gave me a card with the number I need to call to dispatch it to the airport.
;
positive;We were on the 22nd floor so weren't affected by the noise, all we could hear were distant sirens.
;
positive;"I'll tell you about the rates we got and places we actually visited from this hotel."""
;
positive;Great, scenic views that are yours for free (I skipped the tourist lines at the Space Needle and just relaxed in an Adirondack chair on the roof and got a similar view!)
;
positive;(it was hot as all hell with the summer heat and floor heat all at once).
;
positive;"It is a professional and well run hotel."""
;
positive;The location is good, the hotel is newer and well decorated, the complimentary breakfast and Tues-Thurs happy hours are fantastic.
;
positive;So props to thi San Diego Hampton.
;
positive;"Certainly recommendened to others."""
;
positive;2 Minuten ist man mitten im Geschehen.

negative;Gag!
;
negative;There was an exposed heat pipe that we kept burning our hands on because it was where we thought the light switch should have been.

negative;It was sort of dirty and worn.

;
negative;i thought this would be ok because i was getting such a great price, but these rooms were closets.
;
positive;\nI didn't mind the wedding reception event there as it was quiet in my room.
;
positive;Security was pretty tight, which I guess is a good thing.
;
negative;"I imagine this hotel is surviving by dint of its location; I can't imagine anything other aspect selling it."""
;
positive;The king sized bed was great as is the case with all Westins.\nI ended up using the Lobby Wifi.
;
positive;\nthe hotel is in a prime location with great access to the beverly centre (which includes all the top designer shops).
;
positive;She really understood what we were looking for and hooked us up with restaurant bookings in hard to get into places as well as salons etc.
;
positive;There are hundreds of places to eat.
;
positive;Parents in large were care factor zero about anyone else other than themselves and their loud precocious kids.\nHotel has a free shuttle service within a 1 mile radius, which was fantastic in the 108 deg heat..
;
positive;The rooms were small but very clean.
;
negative;The doors all have mold and peeling pain, the bathroom was moldy, the closet was disgusting, and I'm just thankful I didn't catch anything.
;
positive;Parking is directly behind the hotel, piece of cake.

positive;We liked it so much we decided to stay an extra night, which was no problem at all.
;
positive;"""I booked the hotel based on the reviews, why we were very dissapointed, when we checked in only to discover that we had got a tiny room next to the elevator."
;
negative;I got waken up every night with noises from the street and from the hall.
;
positive;The Metro stops right beside the hotel for anything out with walking distance.
;
negative;The two very young girls at the desk were not so friendly, stumbled to answer questions of the area, and seemed very uninterested in anything I was bothering them with.
;
positive;It made my first few sleepless mornings (jet lag) very useful.
;
positive;Its walls were lined with stately wood, and a small but comfortable living room came attached (couch, ottoman, high-backed chairs, the works).
;
positive;The staff is very friendly and the rooms clean.
;
positive;"We ordered room service for breakfast one day: delivery was on time and food was warm and delicious."""
;
positive;I read a prior review that said noise was an issue.
;
negative;You want a desk to work at?
;
positive;Chris, Dave, Wanda, Liz, and Clement took excellent care of us.
;
positive;The only problem we had was that one of the beds was broken - they fixed this right away but in the meantime gave us an additional room for us to stay in!!
;
positive;"""I had not been in the hotel since September 2007..."

negative;En el desayuno te tienes que dar tortas y empujones con los otros huespedes del hotel para conseguir una misera silla donde sentarte.

positive;That was a welcome surprise!

positive;Nel complesso direi molto confortevole sebbene un pizzico rumorosa e non propriamente luminosa.

positive;The pool was very handy considering it was 94 degrees!
;
positive;Everything was very clean, it just needs to be refurnished (drapes, carpet, all cloth products, but bed was very comfortable!)
;
positive;Two subway stops right outside the door, and the Broadway line just a couple of blocks away.
;
positive;We found the advice right on target.
;
positive;Steps to Broadway as well as off- Broadway shows!

positive;"Great Place!"""
;
positive;"""The Hyatt was recently refurbished and the rooms are very comfortable."
;
positive;The rooms are very quiet, well insulated from each other.
;
negative;"I was truly disappointed with the hotel & although its in a great location, I will NEVER stay there again."""
;
positive;The motel was very clean and welcoming.
;
positive;I would skip the hotel breakfast, though, as we were unimpressed and found it overpriced.
;
positive;"The only negative is not having a fridge in the room for cold drinks."""
;
positive;"\nThe hotel does offer an \""express\"" food counter, which offers Pizza Hut pizza, salads, sandwiches, etc."
;
positive;Every aspect of my stay could not have been better.
;
positive;During Happy hour they even offer free food and drink in this elegant setting for Starwood members.
;
positive;I realize families need a room when they travel, I just would have appreciated their room NOT being next to mine.
;
positive;"""I stayed here during the summer of 2010."
;
negative;Also, no continental breakfast is provided and lastly, if you have a room above the 3rd floor, you have to go to the 3rd floor elevator from the lobby.
;
negative;List of problems include:\n* Hard beds\n* Terrible pillows (these two points left with with back pain each morning\n* Poor sound insulation from street noise\n* Tiny bathroom\n* Terrible water pressure\n* The kicker is the protesting.
;
positive;The restaurant is beyond good.
;
positive;\nI would highly recomment the Orchard.
;
positive;"The continental breakfast was sufficient to start the day, cereals, muffins, waffles, etc, no eggs, bacon, etc, but can't complain I guess when its \""free\"", always plenty available."
;
positive;Location was perfect.
;
positive;"The hotel does a good job of holding several/back to back conferences at one time while maintaining good service."""
;
negative;Do yourself a favor: avoid being bitten by both your greed and the bed bugs.
;
positive;The breakfast, evening reception, & cookies/milk give the most bang for your buck in the area.
;
positive;"Still, it's a much better deal than the more prestige, $$$$$ hotels in the immediate area."""
;
positive;Probably other hotels don't even check but I wondered why they checked 60% of the time but let loads of people past whoe didn't show their cards.
;
positive;Las Habitaciones son lindas y el hotel es confortable.

positive;"I'd happily recommend it to other tourists wanting a very handy base for sight-seeing."""
;
positive;It is fun and funky.
;
positive;We got lucky and had 2 bathrooms right outside our room.
;
positive;I found some great things here:\n1) The location was not only close to the business that I was there to attend to, but there was also ample things to do in the area within 1 square mile - movies, restaurants, shopping, etc.
;
negative;Around 6am, the neighbors decided to pack up after their holidays.
;
positive;I used to live in Boston and while nothing compares with a home, the BHHB lends itself to be a home away from home.
;
positive;Metro a block away, Capitol around the corner.
;
positive;"""This is actually a dual review, as I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Denver for a week while managing a small conference at the hotel."
;
positive;\n I would probably rate this a little lower than business class, but not too far below.
;
positive;The hotel room was more than we expected.
;
positive;"\nThey charge for internet but I picked up the Crowne Plazas wifi and it worked free and fine ;)"""
;
negative;Had to request additional towels and coffee.

positive;"The food was spectacular - Compliements to the chef!!"""
;
positive;Housekeeping - rooms spotless and all toiletries and towells replenished every day.
;
positive;One of us actually had a handicapped room, which at first we wanted to change.
;
positive;I was in Denver for business and hotel was great for accomodating large groups.
;
positive;It was 5 minutes walking distance from the air and space museum.
;
positive;It was so nice to walk out the door and be able to explore Sundance Square!
;
negative;Concierge gave me wrong directions and was not very helpful.
;
positive;Decorated in rich chocolate and gold tones it feels very welcoming.

positive;"I guess I could just get used to that trek to the subway!"""
;
positive;It's a take off on the W Hotel chain or any modern boutique hotel.
;
positive;"""after few day in New York City we took the train to go to Washington DC."
;
positive;There is no place you're going to find a hotel that close to the water at that price.
;
negative;So there is that.
;
positive;However we always started the day with our hot breakfast there - everything was wonderful and fresh - could even make your own waffle.
;
positive;The first room in had was tiny with an interior window and they were oversold that night so I couldn't move my room until the next day despite alot of effort of the front desk staff.
;
positive;"The restaurant had great coffee; really!"
;
positive;I am a Platinum Rewards member and used points to say at this hotel.
;
positive;I do not smoke and have a lung condition so that smokey smell was not good.
;
positive;The meeting rooms were quiet and had good technology to help presenters convey messages clearly.
;
positive;The doormen were very personable and greeted us warmly each day on returning to the hotel.
;
positive;Also, my living room window overlooked a fire station, so there was some noise during the night.
;
positive;Attention toutefois \u00e0 demander une chambre avec salle de bain sinon des chambres ont la salle de bain commune et les toilettes au bout du couloir.
;
negative;But it has not aged well recently.

;
positive;"Better stay than any I've had at a Ritz Carlton."""
;
positive;Take a three year old to a wine tasting?
;
positive;:) Overall the trip was good... oh and the breakfast in the morning in the executive lounge is just fruit, cereal, bagels.. not hot... just so you are not disapointed...
;
positive;"But ask for an upgrade to a King when you check in."""
;
positive;Hotel staff were very accommodating and friendly.\nThe rooms are a good 3 Star, flat screen TV's, concierge to help with tours, restaurant for quick breakfasts/coffee, clean, nice bathroom amenities and very comfortable beds.\nGo ahead and pay more for a swankier hotel, but honestly, in San Fran you are out and about and this will do nicely.
;
positive;"You may not think it's a big deal, but they have coffee."""
;
positive;Skip the complimentary premier room meal for breakfast.
;
negative;"One night I recall some of them meeting up with friends (at least people not in uniform) and talking loudly at the door so the \""gang\"" looked even bigger and more intimidating."
;
positive;I would return there every chance I get.\nFirst Rate!!
;
positive;"""This is a wonderful place to stay."
;
positive;"""I really like this property for its great service and location."
;
positive;There are several parking lots around the hotel which charge about $19/day for parking.
;
negative;It wasn't our honeymoon but it was our first night as a married couple.
;
positive;The Keurig coffee maker makes great coffee.
;
negative;"I also noticed there were other people waiting in the lobby for the room to be ready and it was well past the 3:00 standard check-in time.\nWe get to our room on the 8th floor; this room was much quieter, warm, and was also clean."
;
negative;It has been a couple years, but remembering it as a fun and cool place to stay, we decided to stay there this past weekend.
;
positive;Once in New York, go to Joe's Shanghai for there famous soup inside of a dumpling and the delicous hot & sour soup, and everything else there are the best chinese food i ever ate.
;
positive;"le service \u00e0 l ar\u00e9ception et conciergerie est moyen."""

;
positive;"Great choice for a weekend or overnight stay."""
;
positive;"""My husband and I decided to splurge on a nice hotel for our third wedding anniversary."
;
negative;"After the way they treated me, if I \""accidentally\"" got a room here through Priceline, I'd pay for another room in a different hotel for the same night, to avoid staying here."""
;
positive;(So very dark, just 1 weak flourescent bulb.)
;
positive;We went to SF for a bit of romance and night life and got lot's of both, even though we were on a budget we left the city still with money in our pockets.
;
negative;"\nEarly the next morning, we notified the staff, who were gracious enough to \""comp\"" a room service breakfast for the inconvenience."
;
positive;What I got was a pleasant surprise.
;
positive;It is perfectly setup for a family trip with little kids.
;
positive;We highly recommend the red Grayline Sightseeing bus (on and off privileges) as you can see all burrows and sites.
;
positive;Location was great for walking to Central Park and Times Square.
;
positive;\nAll and all, it was a great weekend that everyone enjoyed.
;
positive;Rooms are nice, and clean!!!
;
positive;The TV felt the same way.
;
positive;However, the front desk employees were exceptionally friendly, which made up for this first impression.
;
positive;The location is very NYC...busy and a little rough.
;
positive;"""The Wyndham lived up to our expectations!"
;
positive;The bathroom was a tad small for a suite but the living room complete with barware distracted me from the small size of the bathroom.
;
positive;"""Quiet, clean, decent breakfast, nearby restaurants and excellent location for under $100."
;
positive;Having only a few rooms per floor I think helps in this regard.\nThe hotel provides the standard complimentary Fairfield breakfast, pastries, bread, cereal, bananas, coffee.
;
positive;I suppose someone has to get that room and this time it was us, but I can\u2019t help but wonder why architects can\u2019t manage to design hotels without such poor views.\nOur second issue was with checking out.
;
positive;"""JOSE ROSALES, FRONT OFFICE AGENT, HYATT REGENCY, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS\nWe arrived late in the evening for the SWARS conference and the type room we asked for was not available."
;
positive;"Ave."""
;
positive;I would suggest calling the hotel to make a reservation - they were very helpful and suggested several ways to get discounted rates.
;
positive;We went for breakfast before checking out and it was a disaster.
;
positive;No disappointments here.
;
negative;"I would finally point out that I ended up here through a priceline \""name your own price\"" purchase, for 3 stars in this neighborhood."
;
negative;The bathroom had the cheapest fixtures you could find - really grim.
;
positive;If anyone ahs any questions feel free to coantact me.
;
positive;Had a great room on the 32nd floor, with a nice city view (I'm a Platinum Starwood member).\n My pet peeve with hotels is noise, so a connecting door to another room or excessive hallway noise is always a big downer for me.
;
positive;The bed was very comfortable.
;
negative;the manger was supposed to call me about getting my money back for the night, which has yet to happen.
;
negative;Stock.
;
positive;"""Good location but a bit of a walk to get to subways compared to other locations."
;
positive;"Though some may find it \""a bit off the beaten path\"" we found many shops and restaurants that were located within a 10-15 minute walk."
;
negative;"We really regretted staying here and wished we'd spent a little extra money to stay somewhere nicer."""
;
positive;Not a big deal.
;
positive;I grudgingly went back down to the front desk as I have done in the past anticipating the worst as it has always been for me.
;
positive;They were very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.
;
positive;"We will stay again."""
;
positive;great places to eat recommended by Vinnie.
;
negative;\nNone of these incidents, individually, was a Major Problem, but in aggregate they made for a stay that was consistently full of small annoyances and not what I expect from a purported five star hotel.
;
positive;But when you book (and if you're paying regular price!)
;
positive;"I will definitely stay again!"""
;
positive;I received a courteous e-mail reply within 24 hours from one of the hotel\u2019s managers, who agreed with our sentiments, said he would consider changing the vacuuming schedule, and asked how he could \u201cmake it right\u201d for us on our next stay in Chicago.
;
positive;Having stayed an a lot of hotels, worldwide, I have to say it was sincerely impressive.\nBeyond the excellent customer service,the room was very comfortable, clean and updated.
;
positive;My husband ordered the normal pizza and said it was the best thinner crusted pizza he ever had!
;
negative;In my opinion, both of them should be sacked.
;
positive;15 stops on the way down from the 20th floor.
;
positive;I wouldn't want to try and work from the small campaign desk, surprising noting location in the financial district.
;
positive;Location is fantastic and excellent for the walking tourist.

;
positive;"very good staff"""
;
negative;This hotel needs major renovations (we've seen stains in 2003 that are still present) or need to be rebuilt (which may be in the plans)!
;
positive;I'm not sure what the conversation was about, but it does seem to a casual observer that they should have put their conversation on hold and tended to the waiting guest.
;
positive;"We'll be back!"""
;
positive;Big clean rooms.
;
positive;I highly recommend the Bahia for a family vacation or a romantic getaway for 2.
;
positive;After sightseeing the next day, we returned to our room and did not have our champagne and chocolates or bottled water that day.

positive;"The incredibly late check-in (2:30 AM) that went as smoothly as had I been there in the late afternoon, the room was exquisite, the service was outstanding (picking up my shoes to be shined at 3 AM and having them back before 9 was great), and I couldn't recommend a hotel any more than this one.\nAll of that said, I have two very minor complaints: the iron was missing the \""cap\"" that held the water in, so you had to be careful while ironing not to get your shirts wet; and the shower gel in the bathroom doesn't lather well with just a washcloth (they should either give you a real bath sponge or go back to traditional bar soap).\nThe location is very convenient for anything in Downtown or Uptown."""
;
negative;"""We stayed two nights here, mostly for its good location to the airport and downtown."
;
positive;The shuttle to sea world is great.
;
positive;"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and I will ensure that we always stay here for all of our future travel needs (business, as well as personal!)."""
;
positive;"But, for the service and location, its to be expected."""
;
positive;Out front there are tables with umbrellas.
;
positive;The new Trump SoHo is a block away, but more than triple the price.
;
negative;Perhaps we should have recognized that there would be some ups-and-downs immediately when, during check-in, one very hospitable clerk took us through the sign-in process while another Asian woman clerk screamed into a phone at the desk within five feet of us throughout the entire ten minutes of this uncomfortable and unwelcoming encounter!
;
negative;"Instead of a warm welcome we received \""Hi, your name?\""."
;
positive;Parking is expensive at 50 for 24 hours.
;
positive;Well done Mr.
;
positive;and the Manager presented us\nwith wine for the occasion.
;
positive;"""This hotel is right smack in the middle of the 5th avenue shopping district and close to central park."
;
positive;They had a tea maker in the room with very nice tea cups.
;
positive;"""I Loved My Stay At The Adolphus It Is One Of The Best Stays I Have Had In A Long Time I Would Tell All My Friends And Clients To Stay At The Adolphus."""
;
positive;\nThe elevators do seem a little 'tired.'
;
positive;Of course, once you're on the Metro, you can get anywhere in minutes.
;
negative;I guess you need to pay more money for the free features of a two star at a 3.5 star hotel.
;
positive;The Concierge Lounge on the 27th floor is excellent, worth the extra charge.\nMy only complaint was the front desk personnel.
;
positive;An easy walk to the park and shopping.
;
positive;Bed was quite hard but I got used to it.
;
positive;The Concierge services are excellent and were able to help me with directions and other information.\nThe only recommendation I have for the hotel is to improve housekeeping.
;
negative;no fridge or microwave or iron .\nbut the room smelled like urine even though it looked clean.
;
positive;!\nPersonale molto disponibile e senze presente, dal receptionist al concierge!\nStanza luminosa, arredata con gusto, con tutti i confort possibili, dal lettore dvd al ferro da stiro!\nUnica pecca: il parcheggio con un prezzo da strozzini: $ 32.00 a notte.
;
negative;Hier haben wir aber die Grenze dieser Einsch\u00e4tzung kennen gelernt.
;
positive;Glassware not wrapped and overall room was not as clean as it could be.
;
positive;Third, lets train this nice, young staff.
;
negative;We took the elevator down to leave and it basically stopped on every floor and we ended up being jam packed in like sardines.
;
negative;The bathroom was horrible!!!
;
positive;Bathrooms were nicely updated and clean.
;
positive;Their daily offerings vary from enchiladas, teriyaki chicken, and of course the BBQ Thursday nights.
;
positive;Getting to the front desk from valet and then to elevators from front desk is kind of an odd trail but the location, room size, courtyard and pool deck make this hotel a winner.
;
positive;Rooms need updating.
;
negative;"""I used to stay here while giving technical training classes, years ago."
;
positive;"And the staff were always friendly."""
;
positive;We had been advised about the breakfast, and I have to say, it was excellent.
;
positive;The view was fabulous, and the windows opened so the cool breezes could sweep through the room.
;
positive;Good value and nice folks!
;
positive;Hotel parking is limited to the 11th level and it is a long, serpentine path to get there.
;
positive;Die Unterkunft ist zwar im typisch amerikanischen Motel-Stil.
;
negative;I stepped on it and called the front desk.
;
positive;"""We absolutely LOVED this hotel!"
;
positive;"I'd rank this top of my hotel list as I've also stayed at The Palmer."""
;
negative;I\u2019m pretty sure that by judging from the neighborhood that the only thing the locals use this hotel for is to deal drugs and meet up with hookers.
;
positive;Cute little bunch of rides for the kids at the base of the Needle.\nAn easy walk from the hotel to all the attractions in the Center was probably the best thing about this hotel, vacation wise.
;
positive;A due passi dall'hotel supermercato aperto 24 ore su 24.
;
positive;Had breakfast and must say that this place has the best waffles.
;
positive;"Ask for a quiet room!"""
;
positive;Only (small)issue was I could never figure out how to shower whithout drenching the bathroom floor.
;
positive;"Very near from subway."""
;
positive;We took cabs into the centre of city, Times Square, Blue Circle ferry pier for trip around Manhatten, also to Broadway to the theatre.
;
positive;"Someone was trying to sabatoge the opening of this hotel and reported my review as \""inappropriate\"" , it was deleted within a few days."
;
positive;"""My husband and I stayed for six nights over Thanksgiving."
;
negative;The cafeteria in the lobby didn't open until 7 am, and even though there was a line up of 4-5 people at 6-55 am, the staff stubbornly refused to start serving until 7 on the dot.
;
positive;Plenty of delis and places to eat within one block.
;
positive;Staff was nice - especially front desk and bellmen.
;
positive;The satellite TV was an added bonus.
;
positive;The staff i found were always very friendly even though i was a pain in the butt by being a little clueless and kept asking questions since it was my first time in the big city haha, they were always full of advice, giving directions and tips and would recommend good restaurants and shows day trips etc.
;
positive;"""We stayed here and were put into the executive building next door which was nice."
;
positive;The room was exactly what we reserved, it was very clean, especially the bathroom, and very spacious, as we had a suite.
;
positive;Probably the best i've had at a hotel.
;
positive;The restaraunt was also closed due to a private party later in the day.
;
positive;The elevators were a little slow during busy times, but we eventually got where we needed to go.
;
positive;Oh, did I mention we got a deal on this hotel through Priceline?
;
positive;Convenient location, not right in times square but a $6.00 taxi ride will get you there.
;
positive;The immediate area includes lots of restaurants, shops and amenities, making it a pleasant place for both work and play.\nI received an upgrade to the Exec level, which obviously helps with this evaluation.
;
positive;He told us where to get the best pizza in town is.
;
positive;The hotel is in a very nice and safe area.
;
positive;We ended up at a tapas place called Luzia's.
;
positive;My kids LOVED the heated pool on the penthouse floor.
;
positive;The hotel staff is friendly and they go above and beyond to make sure each meeting is a complete success.
;
positive;We arrived to find the room was not ready.
;
positive;"""This hotel was brilliant, including excellent location."
;
positive;This place had everything and my family and I are very grateful for the excellent service that Town & Country has provided to us.
;
positive;"Will definitely return."""
;
negative;"Yet, I was only there for one sleepless night in San Jose, California."""
;
positive;Chang's restaurant right around the corner.
;
positive;However, when you stay at the Mandarin Oriental your really looking for a great vacation, and as you would imagine it was too much money.
;
positive;The guests have access to the entire athletic club including the 25m lap pool and classes.
;
positive;I would highly recommend it.
;
positive;\nCheck out - smooth, no wait.
;
positive;Jam, my waiter, gave truly excellent service and he looks a lot like Al Pacino!
;
positive;Ganzj\u00e4hrig benutzbar.\nService: Sehr guter Service der Rezeption.
;
positive;Of course lobby etc is very stylishly designed but in a style which runs out of fashion within 2 years.. What I really like is the elevator.
;
positive;"""We stayed at this hotel for 5 days while my husband was taking classes."
;
positive;We booked a room with two queen beds and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and the facilities.
;
positive;"""We were very happy with the location of the hotel: on Broadway, 2 mins from a main underground line, 3 blocks from Central Park and surrounded with delis, groceries and good value restaurants.\nTwo restaurants we would recommend: Citrus and its sister restaurant (name escapes me for the mo) on 75th /Amsterdam and 76th / Amsterdam respectively were great.\nWe asked for a high room with views and thats what we got."
;
negative;The staff did offer use of safe services at the front desk as an alternative, but this would've entailed lining up to access my valuables.
;
positive;With that in mind, I had to find a hotel to stay over night.
;
positive;This time my truck got broken into in the parking lot even though I was parked right outside the door in a well-lit spot.
;
negative;"""When you first see this hotel you get the feel of a very nice and clean hotel."
;
positive;Pretty much all subway routes can be reached within a 5 minute walk of the hotel (buy a 7 day unlimited subway pass - a bargain at $24).\nWe had a large room on the 13th floor, which was clean and had everything that we needed.
;
positive;The executive suite is perfect to allow enough space without feeling restricted.
;
positive;Very good selection, even of condiments.
;
positive;That ran us about $26 each morning.
;
positive;Museum District isn't far away.
;
positive;\nThe Fish Club restaurant was excellent for breakfast.
;
negative;When I checked in they told me there was a small demonstration across the street, and asked me if I wanted a street room on 5th floor or an inside room.
;
positive;The location was brilliant- in the heart of the city, only walking distance from Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue, Central Park.
;
negative;(wer kein gutes Englisch kann ist schlecht beraten.
;
positive;We had a front side room.
;
positive;The location is also perfect, because the hotel is steps away from Broadway and everything Soho has to offer, but Crosby is an extremely quiet street.\nWe were staying to celebrate a special occasion and the hotel staff took great care of us.
;
positive;I felt very comfortable with the linens and the overall cleanliness of the hotel.\nMinuses: We are not subway riders, so I know for many, the proximity to subways made life easier at this hotel.
;
positive;"""I travel to NYC 2-3x year for a few days."
;
negative;The girl was of no help and referenced the fact we were on a price line deal.
;
negative;"This place is Very Very noisey IT does have a nice pool and restaurant ,but if you want to be able to sleep save yourself some money and go some place else."""
;
positive;"The hotel was ideal for a six night stay in New York and we would certainly stay at the Affinia Dumont again."""
;
positive;the rooms are relatively small but comfortable.
;
positive;Everthing about the hotel was good, the room was spotless, the sheets crisp and the staff friendly.
;
positive;#NAME?
;
negative;\nThe property is full of hills (it sits on the side of a cliff) but I didn't mind that.
;
positive;I went to the Sofitel with my husband not knowing that much about their properties except that this location was right in the heart of where I wanted to be.
;
positive;Also, great location--easy on/off the beltway and the hotel is close to a lot of great restaurants.
;
positive;Lets run through my usual list: Top quality beds, linens, and pillows.
;
positive;My boyfriend forgot his toothbrush, and they had spares for free that they sent up.
;
positive;\ncool art-deco styling throughout, playful artwork.
;
negative;We had to close our black out shade because huge spot lights were aimed in our window.
;
positive;"My only complaint was no fridge or mini bar but a few buckets of ice fixed that."""
;
positive;The renovated rooms although small are modern and clean and that is all you really need in NYC.\nThe staff seemed much friendlier then before and more professional.
;
positive;for not much more money, the room was huge!!
;
negative;Acutally, we just wanted a glass of wine before going to dinner, but after seeing what has been done to the ambiance, I was almost in tears.\nUnless you are attacted to dark spaces and synthetic materials, I would give this hotel a pass.
;
positive;The only real complaint was the noise early in the morning (except for Sunday) coming from the dumpsters.
;
positive;This place is staffed like crazy for kids!!!
;
positive;Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly, and the Marina District neighborhood is a lot of fun.
;
positive;Deep-dish pizzas are right around the corner and a grocery store right across the hotel are convenient food options nearby.
;
positive;Vue magnifique depuis la chambre.
;
positive;Metro \u00e0 2 min pour aller partout dans Manhattan.
;
positive;expensive!!!
;
positive;Which it is but not free as one would assume since most Holiday Inn type hotels do offer that to their guests.
;
positive;"""This is the 3rd - maybe 4th - time I've stayed here."
;
negative;I threw them in the garbage can the next morning along with papers, tissues, banana peels, and other trash, but when I came back at night, I found the same cups on the counter !!!!!
;
negative;It was only average and I expected much more.
;
positive;"Very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere!!"""
;
positive;"It's classic \""old Chicago\"" styling is amazing."
;
positive;Check in (at around 6pm on a Thursday) looked at if it was mobbed - but it wasn't, in fact they have an evening wine sampling and guests were milling around clasping large glasses of vino - which I have to say I gazed at longingly.
;
positive;Employee did not mention that only the last 4 elevators service the higher floor, had to go back and ask security how to get to the 22nd.
;
negative;"\nOverall: good location, nice veiws, but basic, cheap, unhelpful, as annoying."""
;
positive;We picked this hotel based on reviews from several sites as we are from Ohio and traveling to visit family for a few days.
;
positive;I know it's a fine dining restaurant but this isn't the Ritz, people.
;
positive;We enjoyed ourselves at the SPA and Fitness Center.
;
positive;"""Spent one night at this hotel near Times Square and have no complaints and more good points than I have time to point out."
;
positive;But what stands out the most for this hotel is the staff.
;
positive;The minibar is expensive but we bought cokes and beers elsewhere and squeezed them into it to chill.
;
positive;Each person we encountered was extremely courteous and professional.
;
positive;"Otherwise, stay was wonderful."""
;
positive;We ate at Open City and Woodley Cafe within a couple minutes walk.
;
negative;"\nOther than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the show"""
;
positive;"Bairro bom, permite andar tarde da noite sem perigo."""
;
positive;It was beautiful and delicious.
;
positive;"Breakfast coffee and pastries were a bonus."""
;
positive;The sportsbar has a happy hour and cheaper drink prices.
;
positive;"""Camera pulita e dotata di ogni confort."
;
positive;The front reception was welcoming (the same goes for checking out.
;
positive;\nWhen making reservations, it was cheaper to book two separate reservations rather than one long stay reservation.
;
positive;No plastic cups here.
;
positive;"I definitely recommend this hotel and hope you enjoy it as much as I did if you stay there!"""
;
positive;\n-The room was immaculate and reasonably appointed.\n- I brought earplugs just in case because of some of the comments about high levels of noise coming from the club in the penthouse.
;
positive;"\nRecommended."""
;
positive;Free coffee, oatmeal, and muffins in the mornings.
;
negative;Even worse it was so noisy at night and we hardly got any sleep.
;
positive;"""Endlich sind die Renovierungen in der Lobby abgeschlossen, und man fuehlt sich als Gast wieder willkommen in diesem wirklich hochwertigem Airport Hotel."
;
positive;Free drinks at check-in, complimentary snacks, sodas, and juice in mini bar, newspaper at your door upon request, and the hotel / room has a fresh smell to it.
;
positive;\nThe breakfast is a great bonus and really sets you up for the day.
;
positive;There is also a big closet and large safe...big enough for your laptop.
;
positive;If you've even stayed in NYC, you know this is a great deal.\nThe rooms are all suites, so there is a sitting room and a separate bedroom.
;
negative;This room was located behind the elevators, the bed was awful in quality, the shower was about 1.5 feet wide and 3 feet long, and it was SUPER SMALL for over $200/night.
;
negative;The service was terrible!
;
positive;It is not in a bustling area but close to many bustling areas---which is ideal.
;
positive;"""My husband and I stayed at Nine Zero for one night recently on a birthday trip down into Boston."
;
negative;"""DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!!!!!"
;
negative;"The 30 welts on my arms, legs, face and back indicated otherwise."""
;
positive;Union Square is two blocks away.
;
negative;"""This has to be one of the worst hotels i have stayed in."
;
positive;The rooms are smaller than average for Seattle and the bathrooms in particular are tiny.
;
positive;This was a real inconvenience and was a sore spot on the trip as we are seniors and don't have the stamina we once had.
;
positive;Location is the best part of the hotel two blocks from the MBTA red line and walking distance to the Garden (20 minutes).
;
positive;The bathroom was ok but there was some mirror tile on the wall that looked out of place and was cracked and crooked.
;
positive;"All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to others."""
;
positive;The bathroom had a large sink area and counter, a separate shower (very nice) and the toilet located in an adjoining room.
;
positive;Loved the breakfast....especially that we were able to reserve a table.
;
positive;\nIf you do like cookie-cutter business-focused hotels you'll be surprised by larger than usual hotel rooms and nicer than usual decor.
;
positive;"As long as you don't require lots of space, i would certainly reccomend this hotel."""
;
positive;For shopping, Century 21 is next door \u2013 go early (it opens at 7:45am) and avoid lunch time and after work as it is a zoo.
;
positive;The room was not newly decorated, but very well kept nonetheless.\nThe staff were both efficient and friendly.
;
positive;"Entre 2 y 3 personas para atender un hotel de 32 pisos"""
;
positive;"\nVERY RECOMMENDED!!!"""
;
positive;The carpets still feel soft and new as you walk over them in your shoes.
;
positive;As a result my room was noisy and a little smelly at times.
;
negative;You could even walk to Fenway Park from here without breaking a sweat.
;
positive;Location is very good near the subway and within walking distance of many sights.
;
positive;The lobby tries to look modern and trendy but the lighting did not work for me.
;
positive;All was as promised upon arrival & check-in was friendly and a breeze.
;
positive;\nThe rooms are all in great shape and the hotel is very modern.
;
positive;O hotel \u00e9 bem localizado e n\u00e3o barulhento, com diversas op\u00e7\u00f5es para comer nas proximidades.
;
positive;The scrambled eggs were always dry and rubbery, there were no bacon, hash browns etc jusr the eggs and some sausage meat.
;
positive;Our room was clean, comfortable and we could control the heat ourselves (pity we couldn't control our gross neighbour, who's every spit-up we could hear .. and there were *a lot*!!).
;
positive;Just be prepared.
;
positive;Water, tower and apples are complimentary.
;
negative;The worst part of the hotel for me, was the hallway outside the room.
;
positive;You could buy a pass with a credit card, but obviously you need to be travelling a fair bit to make it worth it.
;
positive;I would highly recommend staying here.
;
positive;The fireplace rooms are large for a city hotel with books on the shelves, homey wallpaper, and windows that open.
;
positive;The elevator is a bit slow.
;
positive;I had two free nights from Marriott to use before the end of the year, so we decided to book a room at the downtown Courtyard, which is easy walking distance to the tourist sites downtown.
;
negative;"Insufficient plugs in room for your electronic gear, fitness center is a joke; room was sizeable but stuffy."
;
positive;"Tiene incluso una pista de jogging y aparatos de gimnasia en el centro del hotel en la 3\u00aa planta.\nUn Hotel con mucha clase."""
;
positive;Each has a different flavor to match the neighborhood but all boast the same great experience and service.
;
positive;"I will come back."""
;
positive;Nicht alle Zimmer haben Fenster im Bad.\n2.
;
positive;The upmarket shops of Chelsea are nearby, as is the Highline which was a lovely walk on a warm afternoon.\nI walked to and from Times Square area on an evening, and went in a couple of the local bars.
;
positive;Very refreshing on a hot day.\nThe location is awesome.
;
positive;I have to admit, I selected this hotel based on the reviews I saw on TripAdvisor and the fact that a 1 night stay required half the number of points of the other Marriott brands in the Austin area.\nThe earlier positive TA reviews are all spot on.
;
negative;The bed was quite comfortable, but the noise from the hallway traffic doesn't let you sleep in anyway.
;
positive;"The only complaint I have is that I am required to write 100 characters I thought my review was accurate and to the point I had a great stay and wanted to let people know but it just got annoying"""
;
positive;"The stunning lobby and the spacious rooms were unexpected.\nThe staff is warm and welcoming.\nLove the beds too."""
;
positive;"""We live in Victoria, BC and arranged a \""Clipper Vacation\"" - taking the Clipper from Victoria to Seattle."

positive;"""I have been staying here at the sterling for over a month now and find it a very nice place to live.Ther is alot of construction going on but they are really trying to improve the place.You cant beat the price for a long term stay and they have a very nice bar and very good food.Cant wait to see the place once it is complete.The 4th floor is new and very very nice."""
;
positive;\nJust a note that there aren't many food choices around: Bistro Bis is expensive.
;
negative;The waiter spoke almost no English, had no interest whatsoever in bringing me what I asked (had to ask 3 times for a glass of water).
;
positive;My only complaint is that the tub would not drain the water fast enough so you were standing in about a foot of water as you showered.
;
positive;"""I stayed at the Springhill Suites for 2 nights as part of a business trip to Chicago."
;
positive;\nGreat place across the road Cnr Lexington and 48th for breakfast.
;
positive;I tended to pop out for breakfast en route to my days activities (can recommend Dean & Deluca's New York Times Caf\u00e9 - http://www.deandeluca.com/Aboutus/Default.aspx?id=190&selItemId=190&parentItemId=14).
;
positive;Whether in the area for business or to take in the sites, this hotel was so centrally located that it made getting anywhere in town such an ease.
;
positive;The room was clean and had two flat panel TV's so that children can watch there stuff in there room and you have your own screen to enjoy.
;
positive;"""la salle de bain n'est pas en phase avec le reste (baignoire en plastique, rideau de douche)\net interrupteur des ann\u00e9es 60 !!"
;
positive;The view is beautiful and the suite was spacious.
;
positive;"""We were delighted with our choice."
;
negative;"Oh, and terrible."""
;
positive;You are basically just limited once you get inside the hotel.
;
positive;La posizione della struttura \u00e8 perfetta per visitare Manhattan e il personale oltre che gentile \u00e8 ben informato.
;
negative;The gym was not worth the extra cost.
;
negative;when I arrived there late at night.
;
positive;\nI was just left disappointed wi the location - its true that you're not far from a lot of places, but the hotel definitely feels like it is kind of nowhere.
;
positive;The beds were extremely comfortable and triple sheeting was used.
;
negative;I did phone the hotel's internet company and after\na lot of holding they remotely fixed the problem, at least for the time being.
;
positive;"Easy to find on the North Dallas Tollway."""
;
negative;The corridors and room condition were similar.
;
positive;My husband and I had a suite and loved all the decor in the room.
;
negative;"""I stayed one night during a business trip at the Prescott."
;
positive;"""We booked our stay on the computer and my guests were surprised at the savings ."

positive;The interior design is contemporary and beautiful colors have been used throughout.
;
negative;Lol .
;
positive;The rooms are clean and very well designed, the shared bathrooms very clean and equipped with showers that have several heads.
;
positive;Everything was clean and in good condition.
;
positive;Rooms can differ greatly in size, even on the same floor so keep that in mind when I talk about the size of my room.
;
positive;Its in an ideal location across the street from the public library (beautiful building).
;
positive;This information was transmitted to the hotel and when I checked in, the staff member at the desk promptly informed me that my daughter had not yet arrived but that they would have a key ready for her.\nRoom was lovely.
;
positive;\nTulio Ristorante is attached to the lobby and serves fine Italian cuisine, heavy on the seafood.
;
negative;The rooms are also very small compared to hotels in the area.
;
positive;"""Great service and great rooms, all you need is supplied."
;
positive;The only problem I encountered was finding the entrance to the hotel since the building is very narrow and the hotel name is not displayed prominently.
;
positive;"I had a lovely time."""
;
positive;It is very much in the stylish boutique mode but that was fine.
;
negative;The air conditioning was not working but the windows were hard to open and the heat kept coming on...even after it had been turned off.
;
positive;La vista da a una calle de ny tipica con sus restaurantes y debajo hay un cafe para poder desayunar.
;
negative;When I checked in, I was informed that my room had been upgraded (as a Royal Ambassador, this is guaranteed) and given that my existing booking was for the best available suite, I expected something special.
;
positive;but a kitchen lady told us if we've let the hotel know their wouldn't have been any need for us to have tacking our own bread with us as they stock it in the kitchen, what a re-leave that would have been not having all that extra luggage so if you need something just let hotel know in advance and if they can help I sure they will.
;
negative;Room smelled like cigarette smoke, even though it is a no-smoking room.
;
positive;"""Ein wirklich freundliches Hotel in einer guten Gegend."
;
negative;You can't walk anywhere except a shopping center a mile away.
;
negative;"""I booked at the Windsor Hotel after seeing it recommended in a Rough Guides book on the Washington area."

positive;"Definitely left my heart there."""
;
positive;The bed was comfortable and the shower worked great, which for me are the most important things.

negative;Well, it didn't work that way either.
;
positive;There are several convenience stores within a one-block radius of the hotel.
;
positive;We have never stayed at a hotel with such a large pool and an exercise room equiped so well with machines and free weights.
;
negative;I explained the whole situation to her.
;
positive;And it's really not far from downtown & all the restaurants.
;
positive;Our guestroom has a spectaular view of the Pacific Ocean.
;
negative;There weren't robes provided in our room, though our family members had one in their room.
;
positive;The hotel offers a number of internal bars and restaurant options, as well as it being situated close to restaurants outside.
;
negative;"; re-gave conf.# that was given us and now the second person did do some \""due-diligence\"" found the original correct #,(off 1 digit), and now found group, but still insisted that price has exprired??"
;
positive;The rooms were quiet and clean.
;
negative;Just a printed letter from the manager.
;
positive;If we had any comment to make perhaps they could have varied breakfast a little but that said, what we had was fine.
;
positive;The pool even has a 2nd smaller pool with a 3 foot depth that is perfect for little ones.\nAnd, of course, the suites themselves are comfortable and well-equipped with a nice king-size bed and a kitchen.
;
positive;Some roadworks were going on outside the hotel but we didn't get disturbed.
;
positive;We found that management had sent a fruit platter (huge -- we couldn't finish it but we tried) and a lovely note welcoming us and congratulating my daughter on her graduation!
;
negative;Nous vous conseillons l'hotel Murray hill inn, situ\u00e9 sur la 30 eme rue.
;
positive;We were thinking of using the greyline tour.
;

negative;About ten minutes after we checked in, all the power went out, and did not return for at least 2 1/2 hours (this meant they couldn't wash any t towels)...again the staff apologized said it was not their fault, something had gone wrong all around the block (aren't hotels supposed to have backup generators?)...

positive;"\nRegardless of these minor details, I would highly recomend this hotel and definately stay again."""
;
positive;\nRooms: My room was clean and well furnished with desk/pullout computer table, comfortable chair, large screen TV, and normal amenities coffee/tea, bathroom with tub.
;
positive;"Para empezar la ubicaci\u00f3n es estupenda: est\u00e1 sito en una traves\u00eda de Times Square; as\u00ed que est\u00e1 cerca de Port Autothory (por si te apetece ir al outlet Woodbury), del metro, de Macys, .... todo est\u00e1 cerca."

negative;We noticed tiny little brown bugs on the wall next to the a/c unit under the window.
;
positive;The breakfast every morning was wonderful and it was a full breakfas.
;
positive;The hotel restaurant is really good, so we ate there all three nights, since we were working long days.
;
negative;If you are lucky enough to be placed in the tower, you will find smelly hallways and doors to the guest rooms with mermaids on them!
;
negative;I was so amazed I just walked out shaking my head.
;
positive;I also had difficulty connecting to the Internet wirelessly, but the staff brought an Internet cable to the room to help with that.

positive;"""We weren't sure what to expect because some of the reviews said the place was older."
;
positive;Bar tab?
;
positive;\nThe only slight issue was the rooms at night was quite dark.

positive;We took advantage of the complimentary shuttle to go around town in, you just give them a time to pick you up and take you back to the hotel.

positive;"\nOverall it would have been a much pleasant stay if the sheets were fresh."""
;
negative;I have seen bigger bathrooms in caravans.
;
positive;"Love love love this place and can't wait to return."""

positive;"""Travel a good amount for business, including to Boston and Cambridge."
;
positive;The rooms are very clean modern and have amazingly comfortable beds, only problem we found the rooms are small and hard to keep in order for a week.
;
positive;"""We had a fantastic stay at the AMES."
;
positive;BUT, On the Ave is stylish, and the location cannot be beat.
;
positive;Room very clean and spacious.

positive;My wife and I stayed here in Dec 2002 and it was perfect.
;
positive;"""My friends and I stayed at The W Austin June 14-17, and we were BLOWN away by the experience."
;
positive;The pool is heated which was great for the kids.
;
negative;They still have no organization to valet your car--you wait at least 20 minutes or so in the street before you can pull car in.
;
positive;The value exceeds the price.
;
positive;I loved the old world style.
;
negative;They sent someone to fix it but I bet there is still no light in Rm.
;
positive;From the moment we first pulled up to the valet parking attendant, we were blown away by the friendly and professional service.
;
positive;Overall, this was a very good place to stay --- the location was close to Times Square and the subway and a very short walk to the David Letterman Show, where I managed to get tickets on Wednesday for a Thursday afternoon taping...
;
negative;Nothing of ours was missing.
;
positive;Loads of dining up and down Penn.
;
positive;So don't let the proximity to the club discourage you.
;
positive;Complimentary breakfast was buffet style with the usual cereals, waffles, fresh fruit, muffins, toast, cream cheese, ttea, coffee and fruit juices.
;
positive;I liked the fact that the downtown area of Manhattan wasn\u2019t so hectic and crazy and if you can imagine how Times Square can be when it is busy, picture Midtown and Fifth Ave just flooded with pedestrians in every usable inch of sidewalk space.
;
negative;\nI understand that establishments do close, but having already been seated, I did not understand why a kitchen would close when there is still a few people who have not ordered yet.
;
positive;I was on the 10th floor.
;
negative;Team memebers in the Hospitality bsuiness really should go above and beyond to ensure every customer stay is exceptional and can not wait to return because of a woderful experience.
;
positive;The room is comfortable and the price is good.
;
positive;There are also restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and a movie theater within walking distance.
;
positive;After we checked in we went to park the car in their cool parking area which has hand-drawn sketches of various old stars and starlets which delighted my daughter and loaded our stuff into the (small) elevator to our floor.
;
positive;Not small, but tiny.
;
negative;eg, there is meant to be a nightly turn down service.
;
positive;"""I thought this hotel had some neat details (Manga in your night drawer!)"
;
positive;Das Badezimmer war sehr ger\u00e4umig mit hervorragender Dusche und Badewanne.
;
positive;The Ramsey restaurant has a great meat and cheese plate and I always order a little extra proscuitto.
;
positive;We counted four tables that sat after us.... they had finished their food, paid their bill, and left.... all prior to us receiving our food.
;
positive;"The service is like in high end hotels, the ones with personalized service."""
;
negative;In bad need of renovations, except for the lobby.\n If they tell you the Penrose Diner across the street is a 4 star diner, they must not get out much.

negative;Could not find any vending machines.

positive;"It is a nice touch that they have a bottle of water in your car when they retrieve it for you."""

positive;"\nIt's a medium size hotel and I will definitely stay here again!"""
;
positive;It was in the best location possible very near up market shops and restaurants.
;
positive;"""We were greeted by Jill Rudnicki , the manager, with a huge smile and warm welcome."
;
positive;Also not a bad location for getting a cab.\n6.
;
positive;"""This is a rather comfortable & quiet airport hotel that is very convenient to the terminals with overhead connectors."
;
positive;Don't think I heard any other guests while I was there.
;
positive;The lounge is rather small, but good choices in the evening (not open for breakfast).
;
positive;We got fresh towels each day!
;
positive;Whenever we requested something to our room (crib, mini-fridge, bottle opener, etc.)
;
positive;Lobby is on 3rd floor, rooms on different elevators to 45th.\nGingers restaurant has good selection and good service.
;
positive;"\nThe room was great and of a very high standard, the restuarant and bar were good, breakfast especially.\nOverall the place was a very refreshing change from the bland uniformity of the major chains and if I was back in Denver I would make an effort to stay there."""
;
negative;Our room # was 305 and the carpeting was in need of repair and cleaning.
;
positive;While we were there, I decided I wanted my bed at home to be that way, so I have begun looking at feathertops and down pillows.
;
positive;No speeding traffic, noisy car horns, or waking up to trash trucks picking up at 3 a.m.
;
positive;"Overall a very nice place to stay, the location was just right and although we walked the surroundings of the hotel for just one night, it didn't seem unsafe at all.\nBed was great and rooms were good, although sometimes housekeeping service was not perfect.\nWhat we didn`t like: Excessive parking fee ($40+ per day), excessive phone fee (over $10 for a 15 second international call), and shops and restaurants closing very early."""
;
positive;"""This was our second stay at the Essex House on Central Park ."
;
positive;!\nThe beds were okay, I've stayed in less luxurious Hilton hotels with much better beds.
;
positive;The hotel is a few blocks away from the Gaslamp Quarter, and is adjacent to a small bayside shopping village with a number of small shops and restaurants.
;
positive;Each room looked like you could walk into a private office set in the 1920s.
;
negative;Our only request was quiet room.
;
negative;"Stay away from this place."""
;
positive;The front desk people are very nice & helpful.
;
positive;I think that's a great rate for this hotel, and not typical.
;
positive;"""We booked online at another website."
;
positive;"Book with confidence"""
;
positive;I found-out about the complex online, so I figure I'll put my two-cents in, since I enjoyed my time there so much (sorry, honey.)
;
negative;"""My Husband and I stayed at this hotel in 2001."
;
positive;We were happy with the location, walked to Pikes Market and to the tram to the Space Needle.
;
positive;We both loved the ultra-modern urban feel of the room and hotel.
;
positive;"""We are staying here now."
;
positive;I loved my spacious room with its comfortable king-sized bed and overstuffed pillows.
;
positive;For super tall men they have a shower just for you- I usually end up feeling bad for men as most shower heads are on the short end, theirs however are so tall that someone 6'5 would be comfortable haha.
;
positive;\nOnly negatives where that the Au Bon Pain was frequently understaffed leaving long lines and up to 20 min wait just to get a bagel.
;
positive;The hotel was sweet and we were excited to be there.
;
positive;\nI must mention that I looked like a bum when I checked in.
;
positive;"They would have taken us anywhere downtown."""

positive;Tip!

positive;"Price for valet parking overnight was insane ($42/day), but what do you expect in a big city."""

negative;Pancakes were just ok.

;
positive;We were delighted with our choice.\nLOCATION: The hotel is very conveniently located.
;
positive;Several nice things about the hotel..\nLocation - can walk to many of the key areas in SF... all the shops on Market Square and around Union Square... 20 min walk to AT&T Park, walking distance to the Powell street cable car line...\nWe were given a king sized room at the end of the hallway with floor to ceiling windows throughout the entire room facing directly East.

positive;Again, the hotel had free breakfast vouchers for my children, a great, warm pool for the kids to swim, and a movie shown by the pool on the Saturday night.

positive;\n Staff members were very cordial and helpful, especially when I had a problem with a suitcase zipper.
;
positive;I can't comment on the food or drinks as we had all meals out and about.
;
negative;"""We stayed in an executive club room for 4 nights.\nThe room was large enough and the signiture westin heavenly bed didn't disappoint as usual.\nHowever the walls were paper thin-We could not only hear the conversations and laughing in both next door rooms,we could have spoke to them,we most certainly heard every word.\nThis unfortunately included things you do not want to hear at 4am involving the couple in the room next door.\nEssentially there was no privacy,it was like staying with the waltons except late at night that couple next door weren't the waltons!\nThe shower in the rather small bathroom was awfull with sometimes only luke warm water and the water pressure was poor.\nThe bathroom was a disgrace I thought,it was kitted out like a public washroom in my opinion.\nThe bathroom floor tiles looked dirty as if they hadn't seen a mop in a long time.\nThe club lounge was nicely appointed but the hot snacks in the evening were poor,they tasted like they were reheated over several nights eg dried out mini quiches and mini sausage rolls.\nIt was a nice enough place to relax and read a paper untill the crowds came in at snack time's and at breakfast time.\nThe self service basic continental breakfast was grand.\nI wouldn't recommend this hotel to be honest,it's too pricey for what it offers and it is far from luxurious.It's more like a poor 4 star or a standard 3 star.\nThe only 5 star quality I thought it had was the fact that it offers 24hr room service."""
;
positive;DC was an amazing city...too much to do and see..wish we had more time there.
;
positive;\nI was gong to order room service for breakfast but did not as it was, without a doubt, the most overpriced room service I have ever seen.
;
positive;The restaurant definitely met our breakfast needs, although it's a tad pricey and rather bland for a restaurant in a 4.5-star hotel.\nEven though the restaurant fell a bit short for our wants, everything else about the hotel met or exceeded our needs.
;
positive;"The real good thing about the hotel is its location and I really mean you can walk everywhere"""
;
positive;\nI asked for a room in the South Tower on a high floor and got exactly what I wanted.

positive;We were on the 9th floor, so we didn't hear street noise.
;
positive;\nBiggest Complaint: $20 per night to park.
;
positive;They went out of there way to make sure that we had great experience and enjoy our time there.
;
positive;I didn't use any hotel amenities really, I was working during the day, and socializing during the evening.
;
positive;"Inoltre la stazione della metro pi\u00f9 vicina \u00e8 a soli 5 minuti a piedi..."""

negative;Some time then passed and the noise seemed to be getting louder.

;
positive;"""the room was spacious and very well equipped."

negative;I really didn't enjoy my stay, but I was trying to find a reasonable rate in a prime location, during a peak season.
;
positive;"But it still gets to me.\nWe will definitely stay here again."""
;
positive;Maybe it was too early in the morning but it just got to me after a while.
;
negative;I agree that the location is fantastic and the nightlife is top class with celebs floating around on every corner.
;
positive;The room service lady, Carmen, made me feel right at home and fed me well both of the nights I was holed up in my room trying to beat a deadline.
;
negative;As a result, several times I had to wait in line or on hold for 10 minutes for the pleasure of being subjected to their shabby treatment.\nTrue, the bathrooms have nice toiletries and the room has a plasma screen TV, but this is just smearing lipstick on a pig.
;
positive;We didn't eat in the hotel so can't tell you about that and sadly missed the free cocktail as we were out and about in new york.
;
positive;"I'd recommend it."""
;
negative;"For the over $500 they took from my account without telling me, I personally feel that priority should be given to hotel guests at the restaurant.\nSTRIKE 3: We went to breakfast around 9:00 the next morning leaving the \""PLEASE SERVICE\"" sign on the door."
;
positive;And playing with their loud toys.
;
positive;We played Golf at the new TPC course - wonderful.
;
positive;Also, the television/entertainment system is extremely hi-tech, which is great, but it seems to be too hi-tech in that the lag time between selections is excruciating.

positive;We had the view of the river/lake, which was wonderful!!

negative;I left my wife there with all our bags while I went back to the front desk to request a different room, and then went up to check it out.
;
positive;Easy to get around the city.
;
positive;Everybody was indeed very accommodating to us and to our puppy, they delivered puppy treats and toy and cleanup bag to the room.
;
negative;Luckily we could open the windows (which was very dangerous for kids as the windows are only 2 feet from the floor).
;
positive;"but was very good place and the room was a tad small but this did not worry us, they took $100 from us for holding and this was a bit annoying - but was refunded a couple of days after we left"""

;
positive;Service was excellent all around.
;
positive;"All in all I would love to stay again!"""

;
positive;The restaurants are excellent and everything we had was of the highest quality and taste.
;
positive;"""Abbiamo opzionato questo Hotel perch\u00e8 molto ecomonico rispetto agli altri."

positive;The staff could not do enough for you and you get a note everyday to tell you what the weather forecast was the next day.
;
positive;I stayed in a queen room, and it was cozy.
;
positive;Beautiful property with an amazing atrium!
;
positive;Breakfast included a hot, basic well stocked breakfast buffet which is a great deal, if you consider that even some top notch hotels do not throw in breakfast as a perk.
;
negative;\n The second problem was on Friday night when I placed the \u201cdo-not-disturb\u2019 sign on the door prior to going to bed early.
;
positive;They may have a small area with some machines to use temporarily.
;
positive;"My sister and brother in law had a small beer and glass of wine in the hotel bar for $22.00 by comparison we shared a nice bottle of wine in a local restaurant for $17.00.\nThe location in the city was great - walking distance to Central Park, Rockerfeller Center, Times Square, Bloomingdales, Dylans Candy Bar and numerous diners, delis, restaurants, theaters, supermarket and subway.\nAll in all a good experience for our first trip to New York - would certainly recommend the hotel for location and service."""

negative;Also we think for the price it's bad that they charge extra for breakfast and water and Internet.
;
negative;"You have been warned."""
;
positive;No free newspaper on the weekends.
;
positive;\nThe rest of the staff was also very pleasant, but Mr. McNeil was to be commended for making this an extra special stay.

positive;The entire staff is friendly, not overbearing, and happy to help out with any small thing.They thought of everything.
;
negative;"""It's in Downtown LA and; therefore, pricey, I get that, but for the prices I expect much better."
;
negative;Cool down and dry out takes about 1 hour.
;
positive;Das Hotel ist sehr elegant und macht einen gepflegten Eindruck.
;
positive;There did appear to be a musty smell in the bathroom - better ventilation is probably required.\nReception staff friendly and efficient - and other than the musty smell the rooms were kept clean.\nLet's face it, if you are in New York you are not likely to spend a great deal of time in your room so the best feature of the hotel is the location.\nWhilst we did use the subway sometimes, it's best to walk so you can see the sights.
;
positive;Other than that, the room was clean, comfortable and the housekeeping staff was superb.
;
positive;However the truly outstanding feature has to be the staff- they were attentive without being smarmy and the service was unforgettable.
;
negative;once we headed up to our room, I changed my mind.
;
positive;On this partiular trip I left my cell phone charger in the room.
;
positive;It took a long time to get connected, and once you did, the speed wasn't that great.
;
positive;It was like they rolled out the red carpet for me.
;
negative;This visit, the heat in my room did not work - on the second maintenance visit to fix it, the maintenance man told me 'this is a problem with a lot of rooms, I'll just bring you a space heater.'
;
positive;The hotel is only a block or so from the Riverwalk, and 3-4 blocks to other shopping/attractions, easy walking distance even in the June heat.
;
positive;\nBut the staff was very helpful and cordial, and our maid and the turndown service kept our room well stocked and comfortable.
;
negative;Literally 35 minutes on the phone and finally I just gave up as she had no idea what she was doing.
;
positive;Perfect to have snacks to get you through between lunch and dinner.
;
negative;My fears started to be realized when I called on Friday, July 1 (check-in day) to confirm my reservation and the phone wasn't answered (12 rings each time) the first two times that I called.
;
positive;Subway is convenient.
;
positive;"The property is so well maintained, and the staff is so very friendly and curteous.They informed us our \""suite\"" was ready."
;
positive;I would definitely stay again oin this hotel\nSo a bit about San Francisco.
;
positive;And we also received a bit of condescension when we left our boarding pass information they promised to book as the flight opened to get the A passes.
;
positive;Down comforter and sheets were top quality and very comfortable.\nLocation is superb.
;
positive;And boy, am I glad to have done that!

positive;I called Starwood Preferred and received excellent service - they were even able to secure 2 nights for me with my Starwood points over a weekend during the ridiculously busy month of December in Manhattan.
;
positive;"""Great service from beginning to end."
;
positive;"This was my 1st trip to NYC and would definitely return and stay here."""
;
positive;"The hotel is old and probably has seen better days but I have no hesitation in recommending The Affinia Manhatten to friends for their trip to New York."""
;
positive;Crisp fresh bedding.
;
positive;The room is HUGE!
;
positive;Staff is nice and friendly.
;
positive;They really need to add many more lights in the parking lots.\nOur rooms were as requested, a very nice room.
;
negative;If you want to experience downtown Chicago, stay at the Affinia.
;
positive;"I will definitely use this hotel over other hotels next time we come to Austin!"""
;
positive;I just thought it might have been handled a bit better.

;
positive;The valet parking is $24 per night, which is on par with other downtown hotels.
;
positive;A friend saw reviews and said to me is this true what people are writing here and when I read them I was so supprised!
;
positive;Also there was a guy on the night shift named Frank that was very friendly.
;
positive;The front desk staff were always happy to assist with recommendations for food and booze.
;
positive;On a alors la possibilit\u00e9 de faire pas mal de choses \u00e0 pieds.
;
positive;\nGreat location - right in downtown, near some great restaurants (go to Dahlia!!!)

positive;I really like that each room has a refrigerator and a microwave.
;
positive;His rum punch is to die for....my girlfriend had two and wanted more!
;
positive;"""We have stayed at the Marriott Courtyard on the Magnificient Mile in Chicago many times and each time, the service exceeds what it was the time before!"
;
positive;We ended up eating breakfast at the Pour House along the street for $20 less.
;
positive;It's in the heart of the business district, which has it's pros and cons, depending upon the reason for your visit.
;
positive;Beds were comfortable and rooms were chic and modern- we upgraded to newer rooms and were worth it!
;
negative;Actually the motel room would have been better.
;
positive;The manager has already replied saying both points were being taken care of.
;
positive;The directions she gave for the valet parking entrance were also entirely insufficient.
;
positive;Be prepared to walk.
;
negative;I basically had to get a cab every night to go to dinner which isn't cheap.
;
positive;Receptionist was super nice and knowledgable.
;
positive;"Just a \""here's your key...NEXT\"" attitude...didn't ask if we were familiar with the area, if we needed any help with the bags, point out to where the elevators were, nothing - just swipe the card and hand you the key... \nAdding all the PROs and CONs together we come up with a 8 and if it wasn't for the food and the pool and the Front Desk staff this would have easily been a 9/10... \nWould we stay here again -- 100% YES\nWill we stay here again next month when I am back here on business - 100% YES"""
;
positive;Apon our arrival we found hardly any renovations going on.
;
positive;1st time visitors to Chicago, the Concierge was very helpful with pointing out best place for breakfast and how to get about town on the rail and supplied us with umbellas for the one rainy day.\nOne downside is we being smokers opted for the smokers floor.
;
positive;The sheets and comforters were nice, and clean!
;
negative;The very unhelpful receptionist Cassie stated that she could not believe that we had no photo ID as this was required over the whole of the US (not where we had been so maybe only in Boston) she was condesending very unhelpful and finally helped by another receptionist showinf confirmation E-mails we were allowed into our tiny noisy room would not recommend to anyone.
;
positive;I have NEVER asked to change room and I did twice here.
;
positive;The bed was very comfortable.
;
positive;It is a historic building, and has a few glitches - one of the bathrooms did not ventilate well and had some mildew on the ceiling.
;
positive;(We'd never ridden a subway before and were initially intimidated.)
;
positive;The menu was very full and the food preparation excellent.\nThis marked our third stay at the Colonnade over a period of 34 months.
;
positive;"Had a great time and my kids loved the pool and room."""
;
positive;"""I was at the Magnolia Dallas for over two weeks on a business trip."
;
positive;But we walked to most of the sights, but if walking for hours on end is not your thing, taxis here are very cheap - we caught a cab from pier 39 back to the hotel and was only $12.
;
positive;Our daughters' stayed\ncomfy on a sleeper sofa which also had a tv.
;
positive;It is really well located, close enough to Times Square to be in the centre of things but still maintaining a calm atmosphere inside.
;
positive;The manager promptly met with me and understood the situation.
;
negative;"""We stayed here for 1 night on our way home from a southern vacation in May, 2006 and boy was it a mistake!"

positive;We stayed for three and then visited Washington for two nights before returning to the Casablanca for a night before flying home to Australia.\nThis was our third visit and it was great to return!.
;
positive;The free breakfast buffet had a lot of offerings.
;
positive;HD-TV (leider nur englische Sender)\n8.
;
positive;We ate at a couple of restaurants that were close by and within easy walking distance.
;
positive;So this is very nice if you really intend to stay there some what longer.
;
positive;to tourists on the wharf, this location probably isn't for you.
;
positive;Aveda products for the bathroom.
;
positive;They were friendly, professional, and ensured that all my packages posted to the hotel were kept safely, my room was suitable, and that I felt comfortable.
;
positive;And it was fun visiting the theatre on the 2nd floor one evening and a great performance of the Mikado.
;
positive;Some of the rooms are a bit worn but very clean and the suites are a great option for families.
;
positive;Our room was on the second floor facing a brick wall, that was a bit of a downside.
;
positive;Gibson guitar is right across the street from FedEx Forum too.
;
positive;There were 4 of us (2 couples) in a room with 2 double beds.
;
positive;No one is grumpy by any means, but they don't exactly go out of their way to make you feel at home either.
;
positive;The rooms were very clean and comfortable.
;
negative;If only someone would have called us to stop us from making the long trip.
;
positive;Same goes for the shudder of the air-conditioning switching on and off through the night.
;
positive;Davvero pulito e ben tenuto, anche negli spazi comuni.
;
positive;El Valet parking es caro y se cobra aparte.
;
negative;"Do not stay at this hotel as you may get robbed and the hotel will do absolutely nothing to help you"""

negative;Seemed like something the person who gave me the late check out could have mentioned.
;
positive;Very clean room with great maid service and a beautiful view.
;
positive;Great value.
;
positive;I assumed there would be a million things to do around here... After the Dodger game on a Tuesday night my brother and I went for a walk to find a place to get a beer or something.
;
positive;The hotel is perfect if you want to be in the heart of the city.
;
negative;"Skal lige sige vi havde valgt et superior v\u00e6relse med to store Queen size senge...\nNew York er fantasisk, men bliver ikke dette hotel igen.."""
;
positive;"""We were extremely pleased with this hotel."
;
positive;For me the best place to stay, breakfast is perfect!
;
positive;Also the electric shades were a cool touch.\nI found the staff of the Grand Hyatt Seattle to be friendly and obliging.\nThe location of the hotel is a BIG plus.
;
negative;However our experience turned out to be very positive.
;
positive;The staff was extremely helpful, and someone was always available.
;
positive;The Marriott is something else entirely--a brand new highrise.
;
positive;Staff were OK, but a little bit brisk even though they weren't all that busy.
;
positive;Di fronte il central park!
;
positive;Room was large, bed was comfy, staff was friendly and helpful.

positive;My son loved the pool, and I loved the peaceful atmosphere.Also, the breakfast was excellent.\nThe besy part of thr trip, was the sleep I got.
;
positive;If you want a quiet, relaxing vacation, go to Maine!\nThe distance to the subway... there is a subway station less than a block away.
;
positive;It was my husbands birthday they gave us a upgrade and sent him a mini birthday cake and a bottle of wine.
;
positive;\nThe beds were very comfortable.
;
positive;"""Called the hotel around 12:00 and asked if we could check in a little early and it was no problem!"
;
positive;"I am a member and requested a high floor on my reservation but was assigned the second floor; they changed it during check-in."
;
positive;It was my girlfriend's birthday, and we decided to eat dinner in SF and celebrate her birthday at a club near by the hotel.
;
positive;I cannot than k the staff enough for all the help they gave us while we were there.
;
positive;"""We had a delayed flight so ended up having to stay overnight somewhere after our flight back from Europe to Indiana."
;
positive;A great value for your dollar.
;
positive;"""My husband, 5-year-old daughter and myself stayed at the resort for 4 nights and absolutely loved it."
;
positive;The cafe is in the basement and has no natural light.\nNow that I've listed all my gripes, I would still recommend this place if you can get it for a decent price.
;
positive;We could always tell where we were in relation to the Empire State Building, so getting our bearings was easy throughout the city.
;
positive;Very friendly Irishman at the front desk.
;
positive;With the acception of Darryl...the others seemed only friendly when they were about to get a tip.
;
positive;walk from the subway.
;
positive;"""Took my wife to NYC for her 40th birthday."

positive;"""Ideal nach dem langen Flug."
;
positive;The continental breakfast is a nice touch with good bagels and there is FREE wireless throughout the hotel.
;
positive;"Would stay there again for sure."""
;
positive;It is $12.95 for a 24 hour period and less per period if you buy their multi-day package.\nI ate one dinner at the hotel restaurant, called the Rio Rancho, and the food was good.
;
positive;"""We went there for our first anniversary having never been to Chicago before, and were pleased with the value, the cleanliness and the location."
;
positive;We arrived 2 1/2 hours before the standard check-in time of 3:00, but he was gracious enough to find a room for us AND although we booked a standard king cityview, he upgraded us to a corner room on the 26th floor with floor to ceiling views of Herald Square and Macy's!!!
;
positive;Staff was friendly, room was large, included a kitchenette, and it was very clean and comfortable.
;
positive;Nicole was just wonderful.
;
positive;They went as far as to stand in the street to make sure you are able to pull out of the spot.
;
negative;They are not explaining anything!!
;
positive;It was the wrong room - we had booked a superior double to accommodate the three of us and instead found ourselves looking at one king bed.
;
positive;"""We Decided totake a trip to Austin for spring break."
;
positive;The next morning we asked Aisha at the Concierge desk for brunch recommendations and she suggested Friend of a Farmer, about a block or two away.
;
positive;"also litter the harbor so finding places to eat shouldn't be a problem."""
;
positive;We did have a hot water issue, but management took care of that immediately.
;
negative;Unfortunately -- This hotel ranks as one of the worst Hiltons we have visited.
;
negative;On top of being bitten and having experienced a bad reaction to the bites, we are now having to deal with the transport of the bugs to our home.
;
positive;Lobby a bit deserted and restaurants not too busy.
;
positive;Responsive, competent, and polite service personnel.
;
positive;"Nice touch since some people (like myself) don't like dining at the hotel (there are several of the Houston \""faves\"" nearby including the Pappas family restaurants and yes, even a Whataburger).\nThe gallery staff was very friendly and welcomed me to the property, introduced themselves and asked several times if I needed help with anything."
;
positive;"""Located a hundred feet from the red Metro line (Vermont/Beverly), smack in the middle between downtown and Hollywood and a block from the Hollywood freeway, this is a perfect base for exploring Los Angeles."
;
negative;unfortunately booked 2 nights and am writing this review while sitting in this dump.
;
positive;"""We received a small bedroom on the back side of the hotel (no views)."
;
positive;"""The entire staff was terrific."
;
positive;The location was excellent if you are in town for work or a conference, Union Square and Mission ST are a very short walk and for the price compared to what else was available at the time, you really couldn't beat it.
;
positive;Staff was very friendly and accomodating.
;
positive;"Great attention to detail makes for a great stay!"""
;
positive;"""Stayed here again in January with our 2 teenage children.\nThe suites are spacious with a kitchenette a lounge room and a bedroom with 2 queen beds."
;
positive;\nThe suite was gorgeous - tastefully decorated and the size of an apartment - perfect for a long stay.
;
positive;"Otherwise cannot complain!!"""

positive;The bed was very comfortable.
;
positive;Trip Advisor members have done a good job with their reviews of the Affinia Dumont and I was not disappointed.
;
positive;If I stay here again I would request a room on the other side of the hotel.
;
positive;However, when we checked in and saw the room's actual size (so small!
;
positive;I loved the soothing warm beige,grey,pale yellow and green color schreme - style was modern and sophisticated.
;
positive;Otherwise, there is a Walgreen\u2019s, 7-11 and Starbucks located across the street for more reasonable snacking.
;
positive;The food at the restaurant downstairs was good being in the middle of downtown Seattle was great.
;
positive;La atenci\u00f2n y la limpieza buenas.
;
positive;"""Great hotel great location friendly and helpful staff."

negative;i was left on hold on the service line for so long I gave up and went to the front desk.
;
positive;but the beds are fantastically comfortable.
;
positive;Great Food.
;
positive;On the second day, we had to call and get someone to clean the rooms.

;
positive;All the lights went on, they didn't switch them off and we had to get out of bed to switch them all off again.
;
negative;We went to the pool bar twice - first while we were endlessly waiting for our room to become available, and then on Friday night at 11p.
;
positive;They were very helpful, the room was clean, just enough towels, and free breakfeast!
;
negative;WiFi charged at the regular outrageous rates (when will that ever stop?).
;
positive;The ladies in the kitchen were such sweethearts, they opened up early to accomodate us.
;
positive;It is also a block away from the Red line which made it easy to take public transportation.
;
positive;That worked.
;
positive;We stayed here for 5 nights and we had no complaints, which is a seal of approval for any hotel.
;
positive;"""Having just got off the plane in LA, we were quite jetlagged and tired, but this place was relatively easy to find and there was ample underground parking for our hire car."
;
positive;"""Nous avons reserv\u00e9 une chambre avec un tr\u00e9s grand lit, tr\u00e9s confortable."
;
positive;Vom B\u00fcgeleisen bis zur Kaffeemaschine ist alles im Zimmer vorhanden.

positive;The rooms were quite nice and very clean.
;
negative;None of the doors on other floors opened, until the ground floor.
;
positive;The staff was friendly, and made me feel right at home.
;
positive;\nOur room faced I-5 which didn't bother me.
;
negative;This property has experienced some wear and tear.
;
positive;"It is in a great location--easy walking distance to both the Loop and North Michigan Avenue shopping and restaurants; the staff was extremely pleasant and accommodating; complementary breakfasts were elaborate and delicious; rooms had full kitchens."
;
positive;Decided to go out on a limb and book a property closer to the beach this time - It was beyond worth it.\nThe property was recently remodeled, and room furnishings are on par with a much more expensive hotel.
;
positive;One elevator broke down completely.
;
negative;"""My daughter and I recently stayed in this hotel while she attended a conference at the hotel.\nThe pros:\n1."
;
positive;The free breakfast that has both hot and cold items is great.

;
positive;"""They REALLY need more/bigger elevators."
;
positive;It was our honeymoon and they offered us a bottle of wine for free as a present which was so nice!
;
positive;"""We were just looking for a convenient place to stay for one night within an easy drive of Balboa Park."
;
positive;"Consigliato"""
;
positive;so advise against room near elevator.
;
positive;The bathroom is quite nice.
;
positive;That says it all - this hotel obviously treats it staff well - and they in turn treat guests wonderfully!
;
positive;"The only other negative is that I waited for almost 30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive at the airport, although I called when I landed."""
;
positive;"We would most definitely book with the Salisbury again when visiting New York."""
;
positive;The rooms are relatively large and clean, the bedding is new and upscale, the fixtures are updated, the carpet, drapes and furnishings are contemporary and in good repair, and the outdoor pool and courtyard area is large and pristine.
;
positive;I cannot thank all the staff enough and I will do nothing but promote this hotel to my family and friends as it was excellent.
;
positive;I was very pleased when we arrived.
;
positive;Lots of great shopping around nearby Union Square and a short walk to the theatre.
;
positive;"""REALLY NICE...refurbished room, comfortable bed, granite bathroom, no complaints!!"

negative;The walls were beat up from other suitcases hitting them.
;
negative;"Es gibt viele Hotels in der N\u00e4he, die ein besseres Verh\u00e4ltnis bieten und somit werde ich dieses Hotel nicht weiterempfehlen."""
;
positive;The Residence Inn does a great social evening on Monday to Thursday and offers free wine, beer and food for 90 minutes.
;
positive;It looked over the roof of a restaurant but you could see downtown Boston.
;
negative;The hallway smelled like a bathroom, the room was unclean with old food and bugs behind the bed.
;
positive;One time, I was just in the lobby using the free Internet provided, and one of the staff just happened to walk by, stopped, and welcomed me back, saying it had been a while since he had seen me.
;
negative;Every morning we got woken up by the slamming of doors because once you let the door go it slammed against the frame and shook the walls.
;
positive;It is located two block from where my daughter lives, It iis reasonablly close to the metro, and pretty convenient to most of DC.
;
positive;"""We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect location for our stay in Chicago."

;
negative;I called the hotel on my cellphone as I was leaving the hotel to get the late checkout even though I wasn't packed.
;
positive;They were very courteous and always right there to render service to us.
;
positive;The bed was very comfortable.
;
negative;I took pictures and videos and will try to upload them.
;
positive;The location, as others have said, could not be matched.
;
positive;Bellhop was great.
;
positive;It also has a great restaurant across from the lobby which made it super easy to get something good to eat after traveling many hours to arrive.
;
positive;The hotel is directly connected with an enclosed walkway to the hospital with no need to cross the very busy 34th street or brave the elements.
;
negative;"He shows ticket to head bellman--who says \"" why are u giving this to me.\"" I requested another bellman to help."
;
positive;All employees where very friendly and made u feel at home.
;
negative;One of the items I ordered was not included on the tray -- it took me nearly an hour to get someone on the line to follow up, and then they argued with me, claiming that the item had been delivered.
;
positive;Not only are they very corteous and professional, but they are well connected, experienced and effective.
;
negative;Wasting no time we asked for a room change and were told that the hotel was busy and that the only other room available would not be ready for another hour or so.
;
negative;Also rooms on the side of the building next to the Port Authority well be noisy.
;
positive;The room had a great view and the bedding is amazing.
;
positive;Location is wonderful.
;
positive;O \u00fanico inconveniente \u00e9 que fica na mesma rua do Corpo de Bombeiros...(teve uma noite que as sirenes foram insistentes...).
;
positive;Since our room was not yet ready, we walked across to Bryant Park (behind the library) for lunch, 15 minutes later room was ready.
;
positive;"The best thing about the hotel is its location; you're just one block from the Metro (subway), the metro was clean."
;
positive;I live in Las vegas so i'm use to great service.
;
negative;And due to the fantastic location, we decided to stay at the St. Regis.\nThe good:\n*The stuff is amazingly helpful and friendly.\n*The St. Regis Bentley is a fantastic perk and the driver is super nice.\n*The location is top notch.\n*Bathrooms are gorgeous.\n*Rooms are large.\nThe bad:\n*Rooms are old and dilapidated.
;
positive;The staff was great and we weren't usually up early enough to fight for breakfast.
;
positive;"""I booked a 3nts stay directly from the hotel website."
;
positive;The first night I stayed I had the Braised Short Rib Risotto...ridiculously good!
;
positive;Sadly My Wife and I did not care for the location so we asked nicely if we change rooms and were placed in a room in much better location in the hotel.
;
positive;Every room has its own closet.\nIt was very nice that there was free internet, wired and wireless.\nWe didn't have the complimentary breakfast though, we like to go to Caf\u00e9 1134 on Coronado when we are in San Diego.\nThis was actually our best hotel experience ever...
;
negative;I left a tip for the other lady.
;
positive;"We got a great deal through Omni and I would book there again."""
;
negative;HMM.\nSo basically we got nothing resolved in the matter and the Hotel Manager was rude and basically did not want to hear that maybe one of his staff members may have been in the wrong.
;
negative;Funny, on my departure, I've always left unopened sodas and juices for the next guest.
;
positive;On booking in we were told that the Chairman of the hotel wished to meet us who had been informed it was my husband's birthday trip and had even arranged for a bottle of champagne for our room.
;
positive;The bonus point was that the group rate for the wedding was unbelievably affordable for me.
;
positive;Doorman Steve, what an asset.
;
positive;Hotellet virker meget nyt og moderne.
;
positive;Tremendous rooms for NYC.
;
positive;Whether you need a manicure appointment or a dinner reservation you don't even have to think about it...the front desk staff takes care of your requests.
;
positive;My kids liked that the room had the feel of a suite w/ a separate sitting area and sleeping area divided by a half wall.
;
positive;They recommended some great restaurants and had a great knowledge of the area.
;
positive;"The property itself is charming (excellent condition, conveniently located); what is most outstanding is the staff \u2013 very customer oriented \u2013 welcoming and attentive.\nIn particular, I want to recognize Miguel Mosino and his role as Guest Services Manager."
;
positive;The two TV's are great.
;
positive;"As for the staff you are always greeted with a smile and a willingness to serve your needs."""
;
positive;bed on firmer side.\nshower pressure ok. temperature control could use some improvement.
;
positive;Also for cheap eats in the surrounding area: a falaffel place on 79th and Amsterdam, and Zabar's (a NYC institution) at 80th and Broadway, both the corner cafe and the supermarket, with excellent appetizing counter and also prepared foods to go, fairly priced.
;
positive;"""This is one of my favorite hotels."

positive;"""Ett klart prisv\u00e4rt hotell en liten bit fr\u00e5n h\u00e4ndelsernas centrum."
;
positive;Les chambres sont propres, confortables et calmes.
;
negative;If you cannot sleep please contact the Reception & we will give you a set of ear plugs.\nBreakfast was poor & not worth the money.
;
negative;$85 is too much for 11 minutes on the telephone and it is unacceptable for the $12 hotel service fee to not be disclosed along with the room rate.
;
positive;"I will definetley come back!"""
;
positive;"The lobby and room were lovely--I really enjoyed the bath products, the \""rainforest\"" shower, and the bed was comfortable."
;
positive;Chinatown, so what, it's a new experience, safe and very cheap food, look for the cleanliness sticker from the NY authority.
;
positive;We ate their many times at the end of a busy day of site seeing.
;
positive;Our room overlooking Huron was much better in that regard.
;
positive;El hotel prescinde de servicios como el desk, aunque tiene una oficina abierta hasta las 10 de la noche, pero todas las gestiones se hacen via internet.

positive;By the time we decided it was time to change rooms, (4:30am) there was no point since we had to be up in another hour or so.
;
positive;After an early morning drive from the Phoenix area, we arrived in San Diego to a traffic nightmare.
;
positive;We got a great deal on Priceline (less than $100 per night) so I won't sweat the small stuff.
;
positive;We got engaged during our stay and received very warm congratulations from all the staff.
;
positive;Sandwiched between the bay and the ocean has the feel of luxury resort property in Hawaii.
;
positive;Staff friendly.
;
positive;We felt safe even late at night and we were right by the shops.\nPS: there is no air-conditioning indeed, but being San Francisco you don't really need it, and the hotel is not trying to hide it as it says so on their website.
;
positive;I was only in one of the rooms, but the dim lighting, projection screen, and table set up were very comfortable.
;
positive;"Stay here, you will enjoy it."""
;
positive;Straight away a member of staff came over to offer him some too.\nOn another note, this was my husband's first trip to NY and it worked out to be a brilliant location.
;
positive;The property is located on the bay affording great views and plenty of space for leisurely walks.
;
negative;We complained to the staff, who promised to have it cleaned again.
;
positive;"Love security into hotel..made me feel very safe."""
;
positive;"""Very conveniently located near to K Street and not far from Georgetown, across from GWU."
;
positive;\nI did have breakfast at the hotel.
;
positive;The hotel was sold out the night we arrived so a Platinum upgrade was not available but the room we were given was more than adequate.
;
positive;We were really lucky with the weather and couldn't have asked for a nicer end to our holiday.\nWe had a two bed unit, which was really spacious.
;
positive;"\nThe Hotel 1000 is a very nice boutique hotel and, but for the issues we had with the air conditioning and televisions, we would have truly enjoyed our stay."""
;
negative;Unacceptable.
;
negative;I prefer to stay at Marriotts because of their reliability and consistency and I won't allow this incident to change my mind.
;
positive;The room was nicely decorated and very clean.
;
positive;The second level where the coffee bar was was also very nice with spacious comfortable seating and a nice selection of sandwiches and drinks.
;
positive;A few goodies for the kids left in the room.
;
positive;The place feels cleaner and newer than many similar hotels -- perhaps it's because there's laminate (bamboo?)
;
positive;"""Hotel was very clean and good location."
;
positive;"I wouldn't normally stay here at their rack rate prices but there was a discount rate for the meeting I was attending."""
;
positive;"This is a treasure."""
;
positive;\nCONS:\nRestaurant like every other hotel eating establishment is WAY over priced.
;
positive;Great hotel & a great price!
;
positive;It's only about 300 meters from the exit 40th Street SW.
;
positive;It is centrally located to just about everywhere in the city.
;
positive;!\nIn a nut shell, the hotel was great, the staff very, very helpful and the location fantastic, especially on New Years Eve!!!
;
positive;When we go back to NYC, we will definitely stay there again.
;
positive;We are a family of 6 and brought along Inlaws.
;
positive;When I called the front desk and tod them the issues a guy told me that they are cooler's not refrig.
;
positive;The hotel is unique in that though it has many rooms, it is very manageable by guests and it feels warm and cozy rather than giving a cold impersonal feeling as some large hotels do.
;
negative;"I will never again ever ever ever walk near this place again, Kimpton: I was lead astray, never again!"""
;
positive;De badkamer was klein maar schoon en functioneel.
;
positive;Odd-numbered rooms look over the bay and downtown in the distance.\nThere is a complimentary internet access terminal in the lobby, and (I think) free wireless internet access in the public rooms.\nWhile the larger main hotel has larger pools and more restaurants, this place was a nice respite.
;
positive;We were greeted like royalty at check in.
;
positive;I even had turn down service (I'm a Platinum PC member though) which was a really nice touch.
;
positive;The rooms were exceptionally clean and spacious for NYC.
;
negative;There is no closet in the room, the hangers are right in your room.\nThis place has a nice location.
;
positive;"""My family and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Houston and we absolutely loved it."

positive;\nAttention juste au bruit de la rue si vous avez une chambre cot\u00e9 rue, mais comme on n'y \u00e9tais pas souvent en journ\u00e9e, \u00e7a n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 grave.
;
positive;If that is an issue for you, alert the hotel before you show up.
;
positive;Todo limpio y comodo.
;
positive;It was like we were coming to visit friends.

positive;A block away from the convention center, bus ride to the giants at&t ball park.
;
positive;"""My fiance and I stayed here this summer."
;
positive;All this and then there's the location.
;
positive;"Very helpful staff."""
;
positive;The room facilities were more than adaquate, very stylish and modern.
;
positive;I wish it were longer!
;
negative;There is a long line with a lot of angry people.
;
positive;In the end, it cost us $250/night.
;
positive;Second time I called, I had a question about where I could print my boarding pass in the hotel.
;
positive;"""The hotel was nice and very clean."
;
positive;"The rooftop terrace was \""closed for renovations\"" - but I'm sure it's awesome as the Empire State Building Towers over the whole area.\nIt's only one subway stop to Times Square, so we walked there as well - about 15 minutes - up Broadway."
;
positive;Noise from the atrium was not a problem for me during my stay.
;
positive;Only snag was that we promised robes but none were in the room when we checked in.
;
positive;Also a spray pad and toddler pool.
;
positive;"\nI will definitely stay here again."""
;
negative;The first night around 3 a.m. there were 9 police cars barricading a local coffee shop across the street.
;
positive;We did not get one of the recently updated rooms or new beds, but our room was clean and quiet.
;
positive;CD player and TV were a bonus as everything was closed on Xmas eve and Xmas Day.
;
positive;"THANK YOU, GILD HALL!"""
;
negative;"""I stayed here last year for a business meeting."
;
negative;When I arrived after 9pm I was given the key to my room.
;
positive;"The shopping along Broadway just a couple of blocks away is excellent, with branches of most of the Midtown stores, a new Bloomingdales and lots of designer shops.\nOverall, couldn't recommend it more highly."""
;
positive;Then on the days we took the car out we had it out for the entire day.
;
positive;We particularly enjoyed the jazz on Friday evening.
;
negative;etc.
;
positive;They even solved the common problem of not having electric outlet near the bed by positioning the desk as one of bedside stands.
;
positive;My only complaint was that the in room movies were outrageously priced - $20!
;
negative;"""The only positive I can give is that it is near Times Square.\nThe rest.... Vile- the room smelt continuously of Subway food- it got into your clothes and made you feel sick."
;
negative;Rooms were not ready for several hours, housekeeping was inconsistent, tv and internet service was poor, and hotel personnel were rude.
;
positive;The hotel is located within walking distance to monuments, white house and museums and also close to metro.Staff at the in house resteraunt was very nice .
;
positive;Pretty impressed overall!
;
positive;I guess I'm saying, some things in this hotel will need updating in the years to come.
;
positive;Debo decir que aunque en la habitaci\u00f3n hay una carta del gerente pidiendo disculpas por el ruido que puede haber en la noche por la construccion del nuevo WTC, no tuve necesidad de usar los tapones para el oido que te dejan.
;
negative;"And that was a group convention discounted rate!"""
;
positive;There is of course a certain level of street noise but it is not even remotely intrusive and we slept soundly every night.
;
negative;We accepted that it was difficult to maintain good quality service during the storm however then the prices should have been reduced, our rooms for example were not cleaned and there was only one waiter who was run off his feet.
;
negative;"""This place seemed like a great deal- $169 for a king in mid town."
;
negative;"""I booked marina inn for four night stay at orbitz ."
;
positive;"I would recommend to anyone visiting Chicago!"""
;
positive;In my opinion these are not good enough complaints to not stay there as overall the hotel was faultless, very plush and spacious, amazing maids, great location.
;
positive;"""Looking for something not too pricey in EXPENSIVE Boston for a quick weekend."
;
positive;The staff were great.
;
positive;"But, that is a minor \""preference\"" thing.\nWe asked for a late checkout so we could go for a run that morning - and were graciously accommodated."
;
positive;Inbetween this I liaised with a wonderful lady who worked at the Hilton called Hope Boorojian.
;
negative;$5.95 PER MINUTE TO USE THE COMPUTER IN THE BUSINESS CENTER!
;
positive;The room was spacious and clean & the bed was comfy with nice soft sheets.
;
negative;I will never do business with them.
;
positive;We overlooked the parking lot AND the Space Needle (very cool).
;
positive;I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel Allegro to anyone staying in Chicago.
;
positive;Would stay again in a hearbeat.
;
negative;"I believe the bathroom show IS the one shown in the TripAdvisor warning pop up."""
;
positive;Roof top bar is nice.
;
positive;"I would stay at the Eventi again in a New York Minute!!"""
;
positive;Our kids basically had the water park to themselves.
;
positive;It was a good size and had 2 bathrooms.
;
positive;I really loved the power strip near the bed to make the overnight re-loading of cell phone and PC easy.
;
positive;"I love the river view."""
;
positive;Hotel parking and a shuttle to the airport eliminates that hassel.
;
positive;All of the bathroom fixtures and tiles were newer.
;
negative;"I can't believe that they get away with charging those prices, I would definitely not recommend this hotel."""

positive;"I give this hotel a 5 star!"""
;
positive;If you are looking for formal elegance you will hate this place, but if you're up for casual, beach house theme at its very best you will love it.
;
negative;Basically it's walk-able to most places.
;
positive;Hotel checkin was quick and painless.
;
positive;"Overall, we were impressed with the value and convenience."""
;
positive;"""I recently completed a 4 night stay at the Four Seasons Austin."
;
positive;One sits in front of the CVS across the street all day.
;
positive;This was fine because we could get up and get going to see the beautiful city.\nWe did not use all the amenities they had to offer at the hotel but we did check out a few.
;
positive;Their is a fun rooftop bar (casual) as well as the more well known Boom Boom Room.

positive;We were placed in the furthest building away from the main pool but even then it is only a 3 minute walk.
;
positive;"All of the employees went out of their way to make me feel welcome and respond to every request."""
;
positive;We weren't planning on staying in the room much, so the size was perfect.
;
negative;"Big waste of time!"""
;
positive;Hint Hint.
;
positive;This was annoying because we were there for dance.
;
positive;The kids stayed in one while my wife and I stayed in the other.
;
positive;The room was superb, with only some very small maintenance issues keeping it from being an A+.
;
negative;I was told no definately not but that the pipes in our room had burst as it was an old building from 1914.
;
positive;The front desk staff were very helpful and I was booked into room 214.
;
positive;"Thank you HC."""
;
positive;"Thank you to Yari for the special service!"""
;
positive;Every little thing is taken care of and the amenities are fantastic.
;
positive;The rooms were clean and spacious.
;
negative;They had rooms that were larger by 100 sg ft for $429.00 If you can book a room at the liberty for under $300.00 it might be worth it.
;
positive;"Somehow this bed worked for both.\nWe've traveled a lot and between us we feel this is one of the bext hotels we've experienced.\nThe John Ruskin poem carved in stone around the hotel adds to the experience."""
;
positive;My husband and I were traveling with our 4 children.
;
positive;The elevator won't allow you to access the 35th floor (location of pool/gym) until 5:30, so the front desk staff suggested I take the stairs.
;
positive;When i do come back to NYC I would stay here again upgrade my room.
;
negative;Roaches.
;
positive;For what you are getting, you should be paying $100-130 tops in my opinion.
;
positive;I found quite annoying was that numerous emergency vehicles use the road in front of the hotel quite frequently.
;
positive;)\nI had heard so much about the red walls, the crazy security, how some of the staff was rude, etc.....we kind of giggled when we got in the elevator (which is red) thinking about those reviews because it is soooo not a big deal!
;
negative;This was a lie because we contacted her two days later on a Tuesday.
;
positive;It felt a bit like a cave, and the maid sevice cart was loud, but the room was set in the back and it was quiet despite that.
;
positive;"""We stayed in the Michigan Avenure Westin hotel this past weekend and we were very happy with the hotel and staff."
;
positive;Large room with a good view of the city and the park ( although descibed as a city view room).

;
positive;This is for a someone that likes a more modern feel.
;
positive;The River Walk is right behind it which is so convenient and enjoyable The room was spacious, modern, comfortable, clean and with a nice view of the river below.
;
negative;"\nThere are plenty of other good hotels in Center City; don't stay here."""

positive;Will say that the staff was very friendly from porters, to front desk and Jim and Vincent at Concierge desk.
;
positive;No kettle but not everything can be perfect, right?
;
positive;I get really thirsty in the hot weather so my vote is buy orange juice in your room fridge and drink for a lot less.
;
positive;80 degrees F outside so they were maybe over compensating.
;
positive;A lady named Ruth served us and she was great.
;
positive;"Good location and easy to get to Metro or cabs."""
;
negative;Each time I travel to San Francisco, I make it a point to stay here because of the proximity to friends in the Mission but I will never stay here again.
;
positive;The rooms are a little small and the elevators are a little dark (and blue), but fair for the price.
;
positive;Close to the subway, too, for those places a bit too far away to walk.
;
positive;Also, since I come to the US Open, the hotel offers bus transportation to the BJK Tennis Center.
;
positive;Visited roof top pool on a really hot afternoon - welcome dip in the small but clean and not crowded pool.
;
negative;The shower on the floor of my freshman dorm in college many years ago was probably cleaner than the shower in my room.

;
positive;"After another splendid breakfast at Ed's Chowder House, we had to bid the Empire \""Adieu\"" and we were delighted to be able to see the lobby fully lighted in all its glory."

positive;It is a very nice, basic, boutique-style place.

positive;At busy times every day it was not unusual for every elevator that stops at your floor to be crammed with people.
;
positive;We told her we already had plans and she offered to send cookies and milk to our room that evening.
;
positive;From the high quality coffee served every morning to the wine reception every night.
;
positive;"We'll be back next time thru Jax."""
;
positive;They checked me in and out efficiently and were happy to address my concerns.\nThe room itself was clean and tidy, well up to my particular standards.
;
negative;I booked the Hilton thinking that I would get what my money was worth, but how wrong could I have been.\nMy company paid $680.00 per night for an executive room, the room was big but it was very dated and in need of modernisation.\nThe furniture was old and needed to be replaced.\nThe morning of my meeting I woke up to find my shower was not working.

;
positive;Besides location, a hotel is a hotel is a hotel.
;
positive;The hotel itself is what you'd expect from a 3 star hotel -- no incredible amenities, but everything was clean and in working order.
;
positive;This one was no exception.
;
positive;\nThe washroom had a great soaker tub that looked directly into the room, so you could have a view of the city.
;
positive;The hotel was enormous, breathtaking and very pristine.

negative;Era tutto gi\u00e0 pagato al nostro arrivo per una camera matrimoniale (prenotata mesi e mesi prima).Ce ne hanno data invece una con due letti di una piazza e mezzo ciascuno, abbiamo chiesto se era possibile avere come da prenotazione una matrimoniale e il giorno dopo abbiamo fatto il cambio.
;
positive;Microtel was the only one that was under 100$ and I looked up reviews here on tripadvisor.
;
positive;We were very happy with the location.\nMy only complaint was the noise level at night.
;
positive;We did not feel unsafe at all.\nAs for the woman who said the rooms were filthy and their child got black feet off the carpet, she needs to realise that if you let your child run around on the seal outside that this is where you get black feet from, not the carpets in the suites.
;
positive;"As a runner, I found the location on the Riverwalk ideal as I had the opportunity to take a pleasant run up to the new Museum Reach area of the Riverwalk; early in the morning it was quiet and full of nice landscaping, plants, and flowers."

positive;\nits in the ideal location, just a 10 min walk from Michigan Ave, and close to all the theatres which was great.
;
positive;The room has a floor to ceiling window and a nice skyline view, as supposed to seeing your neighbor within reaching distance.
;
negative;The reason for this room check became apparent when I pulled the covers back on the bed and it was covered in hair!
;
negative;"We had two issues in our room over the weekend stay, the first being that the TV did not work consistently throughout our weekend stay, While we weren't in Chicago to watch TV, we did find it frustrating that when we wanted to watch something, (ie, weather report as it was a hot weekend) more often than not it said \""no signal\"" in the upper right hand corner of the TV."

positive;"""Traveled 4 hours to go to an Astros game with my son."
;
positive;La atenci\u00f3n del personal en general fue muy buena, todos fueron muy amables.

;
negative;upon our check in, the service person called the manager, who explained to me, someone came in, demanded a room & was paying cash, so they gave him our room for 2 nights, of our 7 night stay.
;
positive;I have been everywhere and experienced in all (good, bad and crazy).
;
positive;As others have stated \u2013 the bathroom floor does get wet because there is only a slight lip on the shower and no curtain or door.
;
positive;On my next business trip to Houston, I will stay here again.
;
negative;4 rooms.\nWe had a very good memories of a previous stay, after seeing the gorgeous photos of the hotel, the rates, I expected retreive the same quality hotel.
;
negative;The variety of choices weren't great for the complimentary breakfast, I've had better.
;
positive;I couldn't find my Starwood number, he let me stay in the line anyway:).
;
positive;Found everything great except that the wireless internet didn't work at first but then I got it for free (as it should be) and the toilet made a noise all night.
;
positive;Great locaiton on 5th Ave so close to Times Square, Grand Central.
;
positive;Close to BART and MUNI as well.

positive;It was a beautiful bowl and fun to have.
;
negative;"Over all bad stay, will not stay again when we visit Phoenix."""
;
positive;Well, this had led to some undesirable consequences which i will describe in the following, so if anyone stumbles into the special that i have had, please beware.\nAs i checked in to the hotel late at night after the 400 mile journey, i was greeted by the receptionist, who indicated to me that the special offered to me must have been a mistake as the buffet breakfast could not have been included in my price.

negative;"""Muy caro relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio.\nConsidero que el sofitel es una tomadura de pelo y por mi propia experiencia hay mejores hoteles en NY.\nEn la habitaci\u00f3n hay ruido aunque est\u00e9s en una planta superior a la 20.\nNo lo aconsejo."""
;
positive;Very easy to get on and off the freeway.

positive;We used the fitness room, it was really cold & I was glad I was wearing a sweatshirt.

positive;We would definately recommend trying his facility.

positive;I spied the healthclub and pool...has all the latest cardio equipment (even w/ TV monitors attached!

positive;The bathroom too was small but always spotless.
