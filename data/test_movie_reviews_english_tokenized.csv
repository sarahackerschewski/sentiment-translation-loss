positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!!
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;It looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by Richard's looks.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;)<br /><br />All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, it's a real treat.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;But she enjoyed it.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;Yes, it's all the same.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
negative;And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;Enough said.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;"This movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group ""The Band"" in that singer/ keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes."
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
positive;It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I didn't care!
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;Enough said.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;One of the best!
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;One of the best!
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;Sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but, there's something special about them.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;"Man, it is even worst than ""Out for a kill""!"
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
negative;This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.<br /><br />0 out of 10, and that is being generous.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird.
positive;And there are many.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;It's just magic!
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;), and national hero.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
positive;"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making."
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
positive;You'll know what I mean.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;And you know what?
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;Nobody really dies.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;"Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a considerably better film ""Coal Miner's Daughter."""
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;Let me continue.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
positive;From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;The ending is a bit weird, but I won't tell you anything more about it.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;What really surprises me is no one used the name Allen Smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.<br /><br />Anyhow, where to begin.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.

negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;One of the best!
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;), and national hero.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;"Similar to ""They Live"", ""1984"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city."
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;I thought, at least the U.S. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout.
positive;And there are many.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;It looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by Richard's looks.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;I don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby Jack Frosts' were getting killed.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Right then.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;), and national hero.
negative;Like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs!
positive;You be the judge<br /><br />Claudette - An African-American transvestite.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
negative;And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
negative;Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;Working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;Another thing I enjoyed: you care about the characters.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;"No need for an acting career.<br /><br />Such absolute rubbish can only be ""Made in Bollywood"" of course!"
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;They're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other.
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;As it should.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;Maybe I'm a bit masochistic?
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet?
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;It's just amazing.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;was poorly done.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;This is an awful film.<br /><br />This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;As it should.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;"This movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group ""The Band"" in that singer/ keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes."
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues.
negative;Enough said.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;Enough said.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;)<br /><br />All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, it's a real treat.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;Since finding them yourself is half the fun, I've marked them as spoilers.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Cast of Characters<br /><br />Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling White Knight.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;was poorly done.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
negative;Remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old VHS recorder?
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;Sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but, there's something special about them.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant.
positive;As it should.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;Right then.
positive;Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice.<br /><br />The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
positive;<br /><br />I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that.<br /><br />This is a pure thriller/horror movie.
positive;And there are many.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Obviously, the Black Queen<br /><br />Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).<br /><br />Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the White Rabbit<br /><br />Dr.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;It offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;It is not a pretty picture.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a pretty good time watching it because I really did!
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
positive;"If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split""."
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;(One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;I just can't see it any other way.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
positive;I challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;The plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;Nobody really dies.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;I thought, at least the U.S. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;Obviously, the Black Queen<br /><br />Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).<br /><br />Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the White Rabbit<br /><br />Dr.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Right then.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
negative;It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;The plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;As it should.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;Like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs!
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice.<br /><br />The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it.
positive;The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up.
positive;But she enjoyed it.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;He has abs!!!
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone.
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;This film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;Such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete plane.<br /><br />By the way, in a small role as a porter you'll see Frank Coghlan Jr.--the same actor who played Billy Batson in the CAPTAIN MARVEL serial.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;I just can't see it any other way.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;Redeeming features?
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;Oh and he is rich!!!
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;Religious or not!
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;What really surprises me is no one used the name Allen Smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.<br /><br />Anyhow, where to begin.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;Obviously, the Black Queen<br /><br />Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).<br /><br />Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the White Rabbit<br /><br />Dr.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
positive;"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making."
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;What a downer!
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;It is not a pretty picture.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
positive;Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice.<br /><br />The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;But what did I see in this version?
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;<br /><br />Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (Cheshire Cat)<br /><br />The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.<br /><br />The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book.<br /><br />The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;As it should.
negative;He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;I just can't see it any other way.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;Alas, the famously sensitive Manuel would commit suicide.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;What really surprises me is no one used the name Allen Smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.<br /><br />Anyhow, where to begin.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;<br /><br />Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (Cheshire Cat)<br /><br />The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.<br /><br />The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book.<br /><br />The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;What a downer!
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly?
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
negative;Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.<br /><br />Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
negative;This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;However, no plane could fly the way this one did--especially in 1940.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;Oh gosh,I'm really fed up with all these generic Japanese horror films about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;But she enjoyed it.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;Let me continue.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
negative;Enough said.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;What a terrible movie.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;And I am not being unfair.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;Religious or not!
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;It is THAT bad!
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
negative;Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;<br /><br />John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'mad'?
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;I tried to sleep while watching it but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares of it.<br /><br />Please don't watch this movie!
positive;Such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete plane.<br /><br />By the way, in a small role as a porter you'll see Frank Coghlan Jr.--the same actor who played Billy Batson in the CAPTAIN MARVEL serial.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;"""The Fallen"" is just a bad executed remake of those movies!"
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;Let me continue.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
positive;And there are many.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;The story felt honest and brutal.<br /><br />The film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
negative;The bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;I thought, at least the U.S. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."

negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.

positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
negative;Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes.
negative;Enough said.

negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;Nobody really dies.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;It's just amazing.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Maybe I'm a bit masochistic?
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.

positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;), and national hero.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').

positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.

positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;If you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for Seagal.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;And there are many.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn.
negative;"No need for an acting career.<br /><br />Such absolute rubbish can only be ""Made in Bollywood"" of course!"
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;One of the best!
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a pretty good time watching it because I really did!
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggest the White Queen.<br /><br />Other Connections<br /><br />Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;And there are many.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;I've never heard how he ended up in a movie.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
negative;"No need for an acting career.<br /><br />Such absolute rubbish can only be ""Made in Bollywood"" of course!"
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost

positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.

positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;Additionally, it was first used in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE--all had the exploding glass globes--a plot element that obviously has been overused.
negative;It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;Obviously, the Black Queen<br /><br />Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).<br /><br />Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the White Rabbit<br /><br />Dr.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;It's just magic!
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
negative;This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;"This movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group ""The Band"" in that singer/ keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes."
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;What a super deal.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;And it did it more than once!!
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;), and national hero.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;(One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.

negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;Religious or not!
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;You be the judge<br /><br />Claudette - An African-American transvestite.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
positive;It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but by these later films it was rather passé.<br /><br />Fortunately, the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well--with a nifty conclusion where, of course, the culprit reveals himself.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly?
negative;What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;Let me continue.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;This is an awful film.<br /><br />This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
negative;Right then.
negative;What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;This is just a waste of time.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
negative;But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;As it should.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a pretty good time watching it because I really did!
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;And I am not being unfair.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.

positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;As it should.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;)<br /><br />All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, it's a real treat.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;You see mountains, waterfalls, rockies.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;This movie was terrible.
negative;Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;It's one of the best experiences I had watching a slasher movie.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;However, no plane could fly the way this one did--especially in 1940.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
positive;It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I didn't care!
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"

positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;You'll know what I mean.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;Now much of this plot was repeated in other Chan films, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly?
negative;But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;As it should.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
positive;As it should.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;And there are many.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;Working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
positive;One of the best!
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;"If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split""."
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;Ten lines is a lot so I don't know what else to say.<br /><br />Press the eject button NOW and you wont regret it!
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;Alas, the famously sensitive Manuel would commit suicide.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;It's just amazing.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;"Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a considerably better film ""Coal Miner's Daughter."""
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;Maybe I'm a bit masochistic?
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;As it should.
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;"Four of the five members of the Band would appear in another bad film ""Man Outside."""
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
negative;This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen.
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />But hey, you're not alone!!
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;"""The Fallen"" is just a bad executed remake of those movies!"
positive;(One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I didn't care!
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;Yes, it's all the same.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
negative;Nobody really dies.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;Enough said.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;As it should.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;Remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old VHS recorder?
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
positive;I thought, at least the U.S. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
positive;And there are many.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
positive;One of the best!
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;"No need for an acting career.<br /><br />Such absolute rubbish can only be ""Made in Bollywood"" of course!"
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;One of the best!
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;"If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split""."
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;Oh and he is rich!!!
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!!
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;I tried to like this movie.
negative;What a super deal.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;This movie was terrible.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;It is not a pretty picture.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;The plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet?
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;He has abs!!!
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.<br /><br />Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
negative;He seems to be running out of ideas, enthusiasm and money.
positive;The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R.

negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn.
negative;And I am not being unfair.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making."
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;), and national hero.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.

positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;Working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;Enough said.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
negative;What a terrible movie.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice.<br /><br />The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;This is an awful film.<br /><br />This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;-may contain spoilers-<br /><br />Clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;He shouldn't have went to the joint, the swine didn't have a warrant, how his middle aged ,blubbery self maintained a loyal stable of kung fu wenches is a mystery only a student of cults can explain, but all that is beside the point.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac.
negative;This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
positive;And there are many.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggest the White Queen.<br /><br />Other Connections<br /><br />Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
negative;There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;The ending is a bit weird, but I won't tell you anything more about it.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;As it should.
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
negative;It is not a pretty picture.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
negative;This is an awful film.<br /><br />This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;This is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new American bomber.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;Right then.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;), and national hero.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;Ten lines is a lot so I don't know what else to say.<br /><br />Press the eject button NOW and you wont regret it!
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
negative;It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;This is an awful film.<br /><br />This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.<br /><br />Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;Right then.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;<br /><br />I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that.<br /><br />This is a pure thriller/horror movie.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;It looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by Richard's looks.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!

negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;I've never heard how he ended up in a movie.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
negative;The bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!!
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;It offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
positive;And there are many.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;Obviously, the Black Queen<br /><br />Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).<br /><br />Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the White Rabbit<br /><br />Dr.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
negative;It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;One of the best!
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;And you know what?
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
negative;There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes.
positive;And there are many.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;Oh and he is rich!!!
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;As it should.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;The places where it's shot are so wonderful.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;<br /><br />John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'mad'?
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;He has abs!!!
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!!
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;The bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;You see mountains, waterfalls, rockies.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;But she enjoyed it.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;Like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs!
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;And there are many.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;was poorly done.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;Right then.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;What I mean is, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Religious or not!
negative;It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;It was enjoyable to watch enough not to care.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;What a terrible movie.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
positive;And there are many.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."

negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;I've never heard how he ended up in a movie.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;The plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;Also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
negative;Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.<br /><br />Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;"No need for an acting career.<br /><br />Such absolute rubbish can only be ""Made in Bollywood"" of course!"
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;Oh gosh,I'm really fed up with all these generic Japanese horror films about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;No, it has nothing original.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;Nobody really dies.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
positive;As it should.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;It is not a pretty picture.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;), and national hero.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;One of the best!
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly?
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;<br /><br />Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (Cheshire Cat)<br /><br />The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.<br /><br />The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book.<br /><br />The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;Alas, the famously sensitive Manuel would commit suicide.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;It was enjoyable to watch enough not to care.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;was poorly done.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;This movie was terrible.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together make an unbearable nightmare.<br /><br />It is also terribly slow!
positive;Since finding them yourself is half the fun, I've marked them as spoilers.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Cast of Characters<br /><br />Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling White Knight.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;And there are many.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;<br /><br />John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'mad'?
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;I just can't see it any other way.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;As it should.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;was poorly done.
negative;Nobody really dies.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
negative;And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;And there are many.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;The plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;A quality movie all round.
negative;And I am not being unfair.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;But she enjoyed it.
positive;No, it has nothing original.
positive;Another thing I enjoyed: you care about the characters.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;Remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old VHS recorder?
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.

negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;What a terrible movie.
positive;), and national hero.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;It's a glorious home movie of a legendary performer that compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from Established Hollywood to indie film snorefests,hits its mark.
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;One of the best!
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;Redeeming features?
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
negative;was poorly done.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
negative;Right then.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?

negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;Enough said.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
positive;<br /><br />John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'mad'?
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day.

positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
positive;As it should.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;But what did I see in this version?
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;What a downer!
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;You be the judge<br /><br />Claudette - An African-American transvestite.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.

negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.

positive;), and national hero.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;Anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch Art film.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;Enough said.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;They're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;I've never heard how he ended up in a movie.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
positive;Obviously, the Black Queen<br /><br />Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).<br /><br />Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the White Rabbit<br /><br />Dr.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;And you know what?
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;One of the best!
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
negative;What a super deal.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;As it should.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
negative;Also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;"Four of the five members of the Band would appear in another bad film ""Man Outside."""
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
positive;Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice.<br /><br />The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;What a super deal.
positive;This film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;<br /><br />I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that.<br /><br />This is a pure thriller/horror movie.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;What a downer!
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;The story felt honest and brutal.<br /><br />The film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;A great camp film, but a very bad film overall.
negative;And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet?
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
negative;"This movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group ""The Band"" in that singer/ keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes."
negative;And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet?
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
positive;You see mountains, waterfalls, rockies.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;Nobody really dies.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;To right that woman.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;"Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a considerably better film ""Coal Miner's Daughter."""
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;What a terrible movie.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
negative;He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;What a super deal.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
positive;What a downer!
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;He has abs!!!
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;Nobody really dies.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;A fun dumb movie!
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year.
positive;Additionally, it was first used in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE--all had the exploding glass globes--a plot element that obviously has been overused.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one.
negative;Frankly, I have never heard about this movie before.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;What a downer!
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;It's one of the best experiences I had watching a slasher movie.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and retired from the film industry.
negative;Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;As it should.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;It's just magic!
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;The story felt honest and brutal.<br /><br />The film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;But what did I see in this version?
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly?
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.<br /><br />0 out of 10, and that is being generous.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
negative;They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot.
negative;-may contain spoilers-<br /><br />Clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;), and national hero.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat.
positive;The plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
negative;A great camp film, but a very bad film overall.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
positive;the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;Redeeming features?
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;Religious or not!
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;I tried to like this movie.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;It was enjoyable to watch enough not to care.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;He has abs!!!
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;<br /><br />I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that.<br /><br />This is a pure thriller/horror movie.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
negative;Abhishek tried hard but failed.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;Nobody really dies.
positive;It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but by these later films it was rather passé.<br /><br />Fortunately, the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well--with a nifty conclusion where, of course, the culprit reveals himself.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;And it did it more than once!!
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen.
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.

negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;One of the best!
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;Anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch Art film.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;Religious or not!
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;Working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;Rudy Ray Moore came from that background and the character of Dolomite is a mix of the bold Black badasses who strutted through.
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.

positive;Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."

negative;"""The Fallen"" is just a bad executed remake of those movies!"
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;(thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough).
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;A quality movie all round.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.

negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.

positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggest the White Queen.<br /><br />Other Connections<br /><br />Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;was poorly done.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;Oh and he is rich!!!
negative;I don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby Jack Frosts' were getting killed.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;Alas, the famously sensitive Manuel would commit suicide.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;As it should.
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
positive;You'll know what I mean.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;Religious or not!

negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggest the White Queen.<br /><br />Other Connections<br /><br />Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole.

negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.<br /><br />Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.

negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;Not that it mattered much.

negative;It is THAT bad!
negative;Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.

positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."

negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.

positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.

positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;And there are many.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;It offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;Religious or not!
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;Working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
negative;"Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a considerably better film ""Coal Miner's Daughter."""
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;It looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by Richard's looks.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch."
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;"""Ghost Train"" is no exception.It is clearly influenced by ""Ringu"",""Ju-On"",""Shutter"" and ""Pulse"".Two years ago I was into such modern ghost stories,because they usually managed to give me some goosebumps,unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in ""Ghost Train"".In fact the film is really boring.Noriko goes missing in a subway tunnel-like an elementary-school classmate-Nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances,with the help of a youthful train conductor and another ""disappeared"" child's mother.The film offers some mildly creepy moments,however the CGI effects are laughable and the climax is illogical.Skip it."
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;This is an awful film.<br /><br />This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
positive;According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and retired from the film industry.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;The places where it's shot are so wonderful.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;"Four of the five members of the Band would appear in another bad film ""Man Outside."""
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together make an unbearable nightmare.<br /><br />It is also terribly slow!
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;As it should.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;You be the judge<br /><br />Claudette - An African-American transvestite.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;No, it has nothing original.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;Let me continue.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
negative;I don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby Jack Frosts' were getting killed.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;To right that woman.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
negative;Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me?
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;Right then.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;Ten lines is a lot so I don't know what else to say.<br /><br />Press the eject button NOW and you wont regret it!
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;<br /><br />Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (Cheshire Cat)<br /><br />The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.<br /><br />The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book.<br /><br />The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
positive;<br /><br />John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'mad'?
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
negative;Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself.
negative;Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;As it should.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;It offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;"Four of the five members of the Band would appear in another bad film ""Man Outside."""
positive;It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all I know, may be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;I don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby Jack Frosts' were getting killed.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
positive;Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;I tried to sleep while watching it but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares of it.<br /><br />Please don't watch this movie!
positive;I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
negative;was poorly done.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
positive;And there are many.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;"""How do we know it's him?"""
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;(One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!!
negative;Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku!
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!!
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
negative;Enough said.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;And there are many.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;And there are many.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;One of my top movies of the Summer so far.<br /><br />A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green.
positive;One of the best!
negative;Anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch Art film.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;Otherwise, its a totally different movie.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;What a super deal.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
positive;One of the best!
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;)<br /><br />All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, it's a real treat.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
negative;He has abs!!!
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses.
positive;I thought, at least the U.S. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet?
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
negative;Anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch Art film.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;Anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch Art film.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
positive;A quality movie all round.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;Right then.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
negative;-may contain spoilers-<br /><br />Clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;-may contain spoilers-<br /><br />Clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;What a terrible movie.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;I challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Another thing I enjoyed: you care about the characters.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;I challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;"There is also a rip-off of the classic ""get some!"""
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;As usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes).
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;The places where it's shot are so wonderful.
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
positive;I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;Nobody really dies.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;What a terrible movie.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly?
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.
negative;"No need for an acting career.<br /><br />Such absolute rubbish can only be ""Made in Bollywood"" of course!"
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;The ending is a bit weird, but I won't tell you anything more about it.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
negative;What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;Oh and he is rich!!!
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />But hey, you're not alone!!
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original.
positive;Sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but, there's something special about them.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;His kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />There's enough of old action movies with good action.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'Feux Rouges').
negative;There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;"Similar to ""They Live"", ""1984"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city."
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly.
positive;The various Law & Order and CSI franchises had better be glad Dolomite doesn't pass through.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;"I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction."
negative;Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;The bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.
negative;Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;Right then.
negative;Enough said.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
negative;And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />But hey, you're not alone!!
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;A great camp film, but a very bad film overall.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;"But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery."
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;And that's even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
positive;Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way).
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
positive;This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I won't repeat the same compliments.
positive;The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />But hey, you're not alone!!
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;"""Ghost Train"" is no exception.It is clearly influenced by ""Ringu"",""Ju-On"",""Shutter"" and ""Pulse"".Two years ago I was into such modern ghost stories,because they usually managed to give me some goosebumps,unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in ""Ghost Train"".In fact the film is really boring.Noriko goes missing in a subway tunnel-like an elementary-school classmate-Nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances,with the help of a youthful train conductor and another ""disappeared"" child's mother.The film offers some mildly creepy moments,however the CGI effects are laughable and the climax is illogical.Skip it."
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;Also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet?
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
positive;"""The Muppet Movie"" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable."
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;And there are many.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;was poorly done.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;"""How do we know it's him?"""
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;<br /><br />Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (Cheshire Cat)<br /><br />The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.<br /><br />The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book.<br /><br />The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."

negative;And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />But hey, you're not alone!!
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B.

positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;Would we like that done to us in a hundred years?
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.

negative;Redeeming features?
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.

positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating.
positive;But she enjoyed it.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;Here, again we have a dull Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />

positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.<br /><br />0 out of 10, and that is being generous.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.

positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
negative;His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
negative;I've never heard how he ended up in a movie.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;Like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs!
negative;And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;If you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a Roger Corman film.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does.
negative;I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;AX 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
positive;And there are many.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;was poorly done.
positive;And there are many.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;But i found this movie truly moving.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;I challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;As it should.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;(One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
positive;Religious or not!
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.

negative;You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie.
negative;Also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
negative;!<br /><br />Antara Mali cannot act.
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
positive;The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.

positive;), and national hero.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
positive;The story felt honest and brutal.<br /><br />The film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Alas, the famously sensitive Manuel would commit suicide.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;"The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare."
positive;Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
positive;It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.

negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.

positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;What a super deal.
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;via Bill Paxton.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;In any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
negative;I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently again as last night -- well, I should say I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.

positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.

negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice.<br /><br />The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;<br /><br />Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (Cheshire Cat)<br /><br />The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.<br /><br />The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as Alice's adventure did in the book.<br /><br />The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
negative;There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does.
positive;)<br /><br />All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, it's a real treat.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath.
positive;One of the best!
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
positive;First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions.<br /><br />Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)!
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year.
positive;Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
negative;I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
negative;The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
positive;there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .<br /><br />they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).<br /><br />in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite.
positive;In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.

positive;), and national hero.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
negative;Several SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;"If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split""."
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;What a downer!
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson.
negative;*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;There are many more major examples.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
negative;And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute.
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;And so much better than ET!
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;Now much of this plot was repeated in other Chan films, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.

positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.

negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;I watched part of an STV the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.

positive;You be the judge<br /><br />Claudette - An African-American transvestite.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."

positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
negative;This was the major plot.

negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.

negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.

negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep.
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
negative;To start, the acting was terrible.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;"The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess."
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;"There's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the ending is yet another ""art film"" commentary on the futility of war."
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;<br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
positive;), and national hero.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart.
negative;It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
positive;I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;It is not a pretty picture.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;This was like watching a bad car wreck.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate.
positive;Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
negative;"The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that ""you can lose your life-- or your mind!"
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
negative;Redeeming features?
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;"Four of the five members of the Band would appear in another bad film ""Man Outside."""
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggest the White Queen.<br /><br />Other Connections<br /><br />Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
negative;<br /><br />For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!)
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;Yes, it is a bit cheesy.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
positive;THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;Greetings, Moviegoers!
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
positive;But strangely enough, I actually think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;A quality movie all round.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.<br /><br />well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.<br /><br />i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .<br /><br />the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).<br /><br />rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).<br /><br />
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
negative;"No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie?"
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.<br /><br />Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;It has everything better about it from this film.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;Religious or not!
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;Simply, I lost track of Seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
negative;They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
negative;"The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.<br /><br />This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of John Cleese."
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
negative;It looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by Richard's looks.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />The fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
negative;This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;Any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it.
positive;What a downer!
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone.
positive;It only shortchanges the film's values.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
positive;The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror.
positive;I blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and I dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
negative;I KNEW the Germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious!
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.

negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
negative;The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie.
negative;The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s.
positive;To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book.
negative;Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;To right that woman.
positive;Yes, it's all the same.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.<br /><br />Without going into excruciating detail, I can only offer the following advice.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;Guttenberg is rubbish.
negative;The one about a family of pteranodons.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
negative;Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;What a downer!
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;And I am not being unfair.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;Redeeming features?
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
negative;This was the major plot.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
positive;A quality movie all round.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;"Similar to ""They Live"", ""1984"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city."
positive;This is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new American bomber.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;was poorly done.
negative;The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
negative;This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me.
negative;For starters, I once met the director when he was going to WW2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked DARNED good.
positive;This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
positive;How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
negative;And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of the Axis side done well, yet the GI side done comically.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
positive;The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;"But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters."
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.<br /><br />The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey.
positive;However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990.
positive;and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane.

positive;"Similar to ""They Live"", ""1984"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city."
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
positive;Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him.
negative;One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;But even in 1941 the legend was still potent.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;Absolutely heart-wrenching stuff, yet uplifting at it's core.<br /><br />A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steel-working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone, arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10.
negative;Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself.
positive;I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat.
negative;A couple of giant spider/insect flicks.
negative;It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting.
negative;Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;"Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie ""Aliens""."
positive;"Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing ""Rainbow Connection"", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown."
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
positive;Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited.
positive;It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2.
positive;And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;So many people hated this film!
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;It is THAT bad!
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;<br /><br />John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'mad'?
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
positive;So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it!
positive;<br /><br />I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that.<br /><br />This is a pure thriller/horror movie.
negative;It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;), and national hero.
negative;I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin.
positive;One of the best!
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role.
negative;The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb.
positive;In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;"The lady cops,ADAs,and coroners would all be enthralled and the males be subject to such soul shivering,badge melting warp speed kicks ( Wouldn't you just love to see David Caruso's Horatio and that know it all on CSI get Dolomite's Hush Puppies pulled from their respective asses)Ice T might start crying and get back on the Playa Trail.<br /><br />Low low budget,bad but enthusiastic acting,and a vision at what gutbucket nightclubs offered to its patrons;funk bands soul singers,the last vestiges of old style Chitlin Circuit entertainers( that weirdling dance troupe)James Brown,Wilson Pickett,Otis Redding,and a host of others came from those clubs to glory, while their peers labored on in local or regional stardom."
positive;In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours.
positive;Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail.
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;What I mean is, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
negative;There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;What really surprises me is no one used the name Allen Smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.<br /><br />Anyhow, where to begin.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
negative;-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground.
positive;The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I don't agree.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;There are many more major examples.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
negative;She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;Acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try.
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
positive;Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex.
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;Love that hermit.
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
positive;One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
negative;"""How do we know it's him?"""
positive;He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along.
positive;Currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I am interested to see if this trend continues.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;So do the aliens, for that matter.
positive;His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character.
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!
positive;It's one of the best experiences I had watching a slasher movie.
positive;"Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the ""Insolent Waiter."""
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
positive;But he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;And there are many.
negative;A great camp film, but a very bad film overall.
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
positive;It offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior.
negative;It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene.
negative;It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process.
negative;This movie was terrible.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
positive;But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.
positive;However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film.
positive;But, Faith akin, being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
negative;When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;Oh and he is rich!!!
positive;Since finding them yourself is half the fun, I've marked them as spoilers.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Cast of Characters<br /><br />Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling White Knight.
negative;If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
positive;After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast.
negative;This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.<br /><br />0 out of 10, and that is being generous.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;The photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad.
negative;Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either.
positive;I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
negative;The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).
negative;I tried to sleep while watching it but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares of it.<br /><br />Please don't watch this movie!
negative;That's a Rugby ball.
negative;In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).<br /><br />If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;I am disappointed.
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;"Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
negative;Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays.
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;If that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-This movie is terrible.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;After an hour I could no longer stand it.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies).
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
positive;It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV.
negative;To right that woman.
negative;There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;Believe me I will never make that mistake again.
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through.
positive;But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war.
negative;"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising."
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;"This film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's ""Mutt"", Grand Theft Audio's ""We Luv U""), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty."
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;Since finding them yourself is half the fun, I've marked them as spoilers.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Cast of Characters<br /><br />Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling White Knight.
positive;In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley.
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;Now that's a dubious achievement.<br /><br />HERE'S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;"""How do we know it's him?"""
positive;Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
negative;you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
positive;Also, it's not 100% comedy.
negative;I could hardy wait to be seated.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
positive;"But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond ""beyoglu-old town"" It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason."
negative;Not that it mattered much.
negative;I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn't see it through to the end.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
negative;"This movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group ""The Band"" in that singer/ keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes."
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;GOAT EATER.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;<br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.
negative;Nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
negative;DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
negative;This movie received a great write up in Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02.
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
positive;I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews.
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie.
negative;Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;"The ""climax"" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film."
positive;Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
positive;The more I have learned about the coach and team the more I like this movie and its message.<br /><br />I have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
negative;Thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if I'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
negative;SS DOOMTROOPER.
negative;This was how the movie STARTED!
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
positive;Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance.
positive;I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris.
positive;And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
positive;Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;So many people hated this film!
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;The chase scenes are standard fare.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;What a downer!
positive;The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic.
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;Had I now known who had directed this film, I'd have sworn it was directed and written by a German...
positive;It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation.
negative;The movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />What can be done, you ask?
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.

negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
positive;Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
positive;In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy).
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
negative;The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
negative;This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.<br /><br />0 out of 10, and that is being generous.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.

positive;He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion).
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
negative;Right then.
negative;All the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood.
negative;And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />But hey, you're not alone!!
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
positive;The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew.
positive;Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake.
negative;But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.
positive;"I highly doubt there's much left to say about ""The Muppet Movie"" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment."
positive;He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him.
positive;I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;"I challenge anyone who is a ""Aliens (James Cameron 1986)"" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.<br /><br />Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead ""Jack Scalia"" was really absolutely horrible."
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;And I am not being unfair.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;Right then.
negative;"The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."""
negative;His super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life.
negative;"The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the ""motion"" shots."
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;"There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing ""Muppets from Space"" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year."
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
positive;"Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of his major films."
negative;"Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg."
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation.
negative;I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea.
positive;Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later.
negative;This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;The role really deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />You truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
positive;Coach Gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!).
negative;"There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie."
positive;Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;Love that hermit.
negative;It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa.
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.<br /><br />It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is very predictable.
negative;Enough said.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic.
negative;The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all.
negative;Let me continue.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger!
negative;Endless JASON sequels.
positive;The plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
positive;As it should.
positive;Amorphous shapes.
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
negative;There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored.
positive;But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes.
positive;If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more.
positive;I may be a sentimentalist.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
negative;That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.<br /><br />There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched (I kid you not) 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly.
negative;The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it.
positive;As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy.
negative;God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves.
positive;The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background.
negative;"Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I will give this movie a ""1"" because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing."
negative;Horrifyingly bad.
negative;And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works?
positive;While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability.
positive;The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent.
negative;"Just don't be expecting anything along the lines of ""Devil Went Down To Georgia"", ol' Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics."
positive;Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing.
positive;Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
negative;If you ever get a chance to see it, do something else.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;"Provoking an ""ugly cry"" from this watcher.<br /><br />A film worth watching a second and third time."
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
negative;So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver).
negative;What a terrible movie.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
positive;I'll keep hoping!
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;Oy vey... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized.
negative;and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
negative;You'll have a more enjoyable time.<br /><br />The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department.
negative;"We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clichés like ""I just need you to hold me"" in the totally wrong places and situations."
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;"It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV."
positive;This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best.
positive;Since finding them yourself is half the fun, I've marked them as spoilers.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Cast of Characters<br /><br />Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling White Knight.
positive;Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit.
positive;Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film.
positive;Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first.
negative;"Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a considerably better film ""Coal Miner's Daughter."""
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
negative;I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine.
positive;All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it.
positive;As it should.
positive;I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters!
positive;And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical?
negative;She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch.
negative;"Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM."
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba.
negative;Your time will have been better spent.<br /><br />This has been my first movie review.
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
negative;"She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His ""bodyguard"" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler."
negative;I tried to like this movie.
positive;"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making."
negative;But I just didn't care about the characters at all.
negative;I turned it off halfway through.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels.
negative;I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;"""Never Before, Never Again"", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden."
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city.
positive;Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
positive;You be the judge<br /><br />Claudette - An African-American transvestite.
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it.
negative;Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso.
positive;He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently it never happens.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.<br /><br />What made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club.
negative;"We can't really go back to the days of the ""Fade-to-Black"" cue that someone has been killed."
negative;It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
negative;I really wish he'd kept that up.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story.
negative;In the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
positive;It shocked me that this still goes on in the world.
negative;It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time.
negative;Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen?
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre.
positive;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
negative;Ha, joke's on you.
negative;A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;GOAT EATER.
negative;Shame on whoever gave this junk an award.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it.
positive;I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.
negative;Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, have someone flog you with a rubber hose.
positive;<br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;"Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit."
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
negative;I could have told someone how it would end once I got through the first ten minutes.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
negative;Endless HELLRAISER sequels.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;If we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
positive;The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.
positive;As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
negative;"Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.<br /><br />But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine ""thriller""."
positive;No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius?
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;Religious or not!
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before.
negative;Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids.
positive;Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007?
negative;Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson sort of way!
positive;As it should.
positive;I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war.
positive;An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully.
positive;DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.
positive;Not so with Forever Strong.
negative;As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.
positive;"This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe))."
positive;In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life.
negative;So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together.
positive;Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth.
positive;He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial.
negative;A kickboxing scarecrow.
negative;This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie.
positive;It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released).
negative;Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
negative;And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood).
negative;Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one.
negative;"This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent ""God damn""."
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
negative;This was the major plot.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
negative;An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive.
positive;The two are diametrically opposed.
negative;If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know, I could have been ¾ of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.<br /><br />By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding off.
negative;I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash.
positive;It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
positive;Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree.
negative;That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon.
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;And so much better than ET!
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;If there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog.
positive;As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
positive;Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers.
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
positive;Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to.
negative;We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls.
positive;I believe Carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all.
negative;RGV's lost his marbles.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
negative;Yes, this movie is a horror.
positive;In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made.
negative;"IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice over on an ""enhanced"" DVD (there's another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking."
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.
negative;I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder.
negative;Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene.
negative;The phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the American military at all.
positive;I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
positive;It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration.
negative;This movie was terrible.
negative;It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
negative;So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together.
negative;This is just a waste of time.
negative;The one about a family of sabertooth tigers.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
negative;I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003.
positive;Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.)
negative;After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
negative;I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;)<br /><br />All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, it's a real treat.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character.
negative;Worse than all Dean Cain films combined.
negative;The whole command structure between crew and Capt.
negative;awful, awful, awful.
positive;Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all.
negative;Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all.
positive;Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why.
positive;Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.
negative;Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not.
positive;They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier.
positive;The story felt honest and brutal.<br /><br />The film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.
positive;What I mean is, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;How do you NOT wrap that up?<br /><br />I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
positive;And much better than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer.
negative;The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.<br /><br />I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog.
positive;For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again.
positive;Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War).
positive;Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
negative;"It included such lines as ""I got a bad feeling about this"" and ""Kill me"" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the ""alien hop"" just before it pops out of his stomach."
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;One of the best!
positive;The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels.
positive;Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?
negative;The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.
positive;One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart.
negative;I rate it 1 star out of 10.
positive;"With todays ""evil doer"" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.<br /><br />Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous."
positive;Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song?
negative;"Because as much as I applaud what he accomplished on a clearly ""next to nothing"" budget, when I popped out the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours of nothing."
positive;Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
positive;But, while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films.
positive;This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.
negative;Not that it mattered much.
positive;And there are many.
negative;All the character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles.
positive;On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo.
positive;The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
positive;And it did it more than once!!
positive;"This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but I'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version."
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
positive;It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it.
positive;This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time.
positive;Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who.
positive;The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own.
positive;I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto.
negative;The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie.
positive;Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing.
positive;Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it!
positive;After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence.
positive;A pulsing thud thud every two seconds.
negative;I knew nothing of the plot nor the players.
negative;"This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover ""watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!""."
positive;This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.<br /><br />It's worth every penny.
positive;"There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated ""Rainbow Connection"" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, ""Movin' Right Along"", and ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday"", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo."
negative;This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up.
negative;That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program.
negative;I am disappointed.
negative;It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve.
negative;I like to think I have seen it all.
negative;Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder.
positive;I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade.
positive;Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue.
positive;"And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes?"
positive;The best videos, like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around.
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
negative;Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.
positive;It was the first movie that reduced me to tears.
negative;"""Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels""... 'nuff said."
negative;Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
negative;""", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and ""acting"" natural."
positive;Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved.
positive;Kermit takes his advice and goes west.
negative;The GIs simply got shafted hard in this film.
positive;From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
positive;Since finding them yourself is half the fun, I've marked them as spoilers.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Cast of Characters<br /><br />Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling White Knight.
positive;And there are many.
negative;If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, this is gold.
negative;But this movie didn't do it.
positive;"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan""."
positive;This is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions.
negative;You could guess he was the main problem long before the end.
negative;If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.<br /><br />I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv, if it has I don't know why.
negative;One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at.
negative;Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.
negative;Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
negative;These reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />You see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters.
positive;Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics.
positive;But a shape-changing alien.
negative;There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough.
positive;He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess).
