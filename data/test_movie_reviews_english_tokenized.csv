positive;America is on top right!!
positive;Director Griffin Dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly.
negative;Well he's a Nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible, right?
positive;It was a totally unexpected delight.
negative;"Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"""
positive;I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming....
positive;This might be(except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best film.
positive;"I am sure it will one day take its rightful place with such great shows as ""The Fantastiks"", and ""Waiting for Godot."""
negative;<br /><br />Major hypocrisy #2: The Nazis make a propaganda movie about a German sniper who kills nearly 300 American soldiers.
negative;The fact that McGivers switches back to Kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way.
negative;It has more of a comedy tone to it as well which hinders it greatly, if they really felt the need to make a sequel they should have made it an R rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it.
negative;It looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception.
negative;A lone hero left alone in a ship (building, airplane, whatever) wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons.
positive;How about when Gus' sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cable-access special effects quality mastercraft?
positive;Aishwarya was easily at her best.
negative;Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does, and PLEASE for the love of all that is decent and holy... GO AWAY and stop degrading yourself like this!
positive;"He rejected the ""training"" of the karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense no holds form of training."
positive;What is the significance of the rotting corpse at Sierra Bonita?
negative;Formulaic, to say the least.
negative;Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 90s.
positive;I know I've done it-and so have many females I know.
negative;Nothing unexpected happens.
positive;The story-telling is great.
negative;"Is there anybody there?"""
negative;Rudolph Mat√©'s film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's, Dexter Cornell(Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage.
positive;The first half of this fun flick shows Quinn being trained and indoctrinated.
negative;In fact, only the vikings (wizard excepted) are funny.
positive;This production was top notch with the original music score, and the actors put their hearts into it(you can tell).
positive;But Thomas' friends arrive to help save the day.
negative;But pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film.
negative;"Waste it on better movies."""
positive;The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic.
positive;But I can tell you it was good and I did laugh, not as much as I had hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction.
positive;But Slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened--however, Slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it!
negative;I guess the movie was set in New Orleans, but Aside from the afore mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in Anytown, USA.<br /><br />My recommendation: don't bother!
positive;Would a person with low self-esteem, be considered a schizophrenic because he/she shuns company ... preferring instead to live in a world of his/her own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security?<br /><br />Konkona, as Meethi, is outstanding!!
positive;"Whether it's arranged marriages (which it used to be like among Jews about 150 years ago, or like it is among many modern Indians), they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or, just plain loveless marriages....."
positive;What it lack in Minghella subtlety (different writer) it partially makes up for in boldness as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual.
negative;The characters in the storyline are not convincing, neither Jane nor McCracken nor Andrej.
negative;Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation, wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive.
positive;Perhaps even more than the Performing Arts kids, we were expected to change the world, although not necessarily become famous.
negative;The jokes were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original Bruce Almighty's Jim Carrey.
positive;And the homosexual guy-isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah?
negative;The special effects are embarrassing even for a made for TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack.
negative;Most probably self funded this is clearly an attempt to redress important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged, who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch, buy or rent this film, why would anyone bother in the first place?
negative;What Lonsdale is doing in this is anyone's guess.
positive;He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance.
negative;Maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh?
negative;We have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice.
negative;"The key stroke logging was laughable to say the least.<br /><br />Regarding the software that was supposedly being installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested, retested and tested again on a sandbagged system.<br /><br />But probably the worst possible part of the movie was the ""virus""."
positive;This was a excellent back when it came out.
negative;No, no, I mean a LOT.
negative;"""(Belloc,""The Example"").<br /><br />I had absolutely no other reason to watch this dull movie except that Rourke was in."
negative;Eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didn't do a very great job.
negative;We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.
negative;moments overwhelm anyone's capacity for suspension of disbelief, the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped.
negative;I'll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10: one point apiece for James Mason's performance, the early scene with the children, and the authentic Victorian typesetting in that auctioneer's handbill.
negative;"I'm saying that it was almost down there with ""Kazaam""."
positive;Again, I have seen SO many bands perform, some small - some the current 'masters.'
positive;That alone makes it worth seeing.
negative;The dialogue sucked.
positive;The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.<br /><br />It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone.
positive;We are helpless without each other.
positive;Do I need to say more?
positive;This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for.
negative;but, i highly doubt it.
negative;It's not awful but what a waste...
positive;Check it out sometime.
positive;Is it full moon tonight?
positive;!..The actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished..Now everyone needs to get on with their lives...only one problem though...they have to get new lives...the old lives are gone forever...Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!!
negative;I don't know.
negative;Wouldn`t alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something ?
negative;"It employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you've seen in ""Outbreak"", ""Armageddon"", the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others.<br /><br />The direction is awful."
negative;A genuinely touching stage moment, several of the seductions, and a few of the comedic color actually work out.
positive;She flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for.
positive;As one familiar with the type of humour shown in the TV series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen.
positive;Ever since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favourite video games.
negative;This movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes.
negative;At first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac, but as it turns out, he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie.
positive;Is Geena hot or what?
positive;<br /><br />Furthermore, I won't go into the glimpse one gets of legendary Parisian entertainers, including a brief vision of Piaf, nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural.
negative;The sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality.
positive;David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming selves with Granger as an especially delightful and ingenious gentleman.
positive;"<br /><br />4/ Bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes <br /><br />5/ the trapeze scene while Nero chasing after Bugs <br /><br />6/ the famous Human Cannonball scene after which Nero the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hula<br /><br />The magic moments which keep Acrobatty Bunny fresh at all times in our memory:<br /><br />1/ When Bugs comes out of his bunny hole, he thinks he's in the Pinocchio tale; and starts acting to save Pinocchio out of the giant whale's stomach <br /><br />2/ When the Lion roars to scare him, Bugs replies back to him with roaring<br /><br />3/ Bugs arguing with the Lion for he's making so much noise, then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him <br /><br />4/ Wearing rubber heels at the circus, Bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes Nero to bounce!"
positive;Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend.
positive;The movie was even better then the commercials put on.
negative;I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind.
negative;"Yep, that's how fast it was produced... the song that ""inspired"" it was still big on the charts when the film was released!<br /><br />Despite decades of seeing bad movies, this one still impresses me for its extravagant, no-holds-barred, headlong jump into the most tedious, absurd, and indelible cinematic badness."
positive;The Blue State mentality.
negative;This final installment to the House Party series is by far the worst, not just sequel, but film released by Hollywood.
positive;The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment.
positive;Kudos to the graphics and character voice overs.
negative;And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention.
positive;On t.v., the lack of close-ups and distant sound reproduction may prove daunting.
positive;Yes, please!
positive;I think my favorite scene is at the very end, with Phil in a full body cast.
negative;He takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty.
positive;We are shown the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man pinned to a stockade wall and a lance sticking out of his belly.
negative;I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man from Lambert's Tarzan.
negative;Amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn't a threat to her.
negative;The biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it's just plain stupid.
positive;It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection, mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting.
negative;My kids stood astonished because even THEY know that Lot was not even thought of when Noah was building the ark.
negative;When a BBC murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer must be: The Homosexual.<br /><br />Who murdered the sexy blonde teenager (who's also a pathological liar) on her way home from school?
negative;Watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell.
positive;The 35mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts.
negative;"""<br /><br />Karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids I've ever seen."
negative;I've enjoyed watching Lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when Lost is good, it's really good!
negative;Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process!
negative;Why did she agree to do this?
positive;"Olive falls for Bluto's less than honorable attentions; until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out, ""Hey Babe, how 'bout a kiss?"""
negative;The two directors certainly must have known each other and either had a sort of juvenile rivalry or an actual dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to upstage them.
positive;She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book.
positive;Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders, adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.
positive;Is it too derogatory for the medical field?
negative;"This movie is essentially a ""how-to"" on how to be a well-connected pedophile."
negative;One can only assume they all had property there.
positive;"""This is my stamping ground."
positive;We had no auditions, but instead rigorous entrance exams.
positive;Soon came Skateboard Odyssey in Mission Viejo.
negative;"Although none of the songs have the word ""moon"" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great nontheless."
negative;"I lied if I'd tell that I remember it in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's.<br /><br />Supposedly, ""Fuckland"" is a critic of Argentinians, presenting us (I'm an Argentinian too) as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty, ridiculous victories, and think we're the best thing that God (who is also an Argentinian) created."
negative;"Kagome for example: She overreacts too much to my taste; she acts like Yuka from Elfen Lied."
positive;The subsequent flirtation Herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut.
negative;Characters scream, wail, howl and yell, chitter and laugh maniacally.
positive;Even though I have already seen the movies a lot of times, when I seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for Kramer vs Kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.
positive;It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything I've ever seen.
negative;I think the Geneva Convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasn't the point here.
negative;"A final note, be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the ""dramatic"" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A."
negative;Scene after scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly.
positive;He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface.
negative;You know, I didn't expect much from this film, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was senseless.
negative;But I seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making Hard Justice.
negative;Shot on video it appears, with a bad script and bad direction, one would think it would also have horrible production value.
positive;'Hi-De-Hi!'
positive;Lance bears the onus of all¬óexcept the few who know about the circumstances that brought about the change of orders putting Holloway in charge of the detail.
positive;"For those who might think Paget & Hunter can't act and were only hired for their physical attributes, check out their subtle, overlooked, heartbreaking work together a few years later in ""White Feather"" (another Fox production that has sadly vanished into the realm of ""lost films"")."
positive;<br /><br />One more note: Laurel & Hardy buffs, that bake sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC-the 'flapper' getting into her car and getting it in the rear end.
positive;it was a sleeper movie.
positive;How dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly!
negative;"I hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director ""Pieter Jan Brugge"" cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words ""suspence and thriller""."
negative;Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is.
positive;Even today, the end result is highly effective.
negative;"As like many films funded by the government bodies the film takes it self way to seriously, the script and its execution appear to be chores rather then gifts and unfortunately for the talented thespians, their brilliant performances (particularly Tom Long as the fractured protagonist) are stuck within the confines of a pompous wan k fest."""
negative;"Goudurix could be great (like in the book) but he is too clearly a ""cool guy"" having a love affair (with an uninteresting made up female character)."
negative;"Where ""The Grinch"" was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, ""The Cat"" was destroyed by Myers."
negative;As in, she doesn't end up with AIDEN, she ends up with GABRIEL.
positive;I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film communicated to my senses.
negative;<br /><br />In this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated.
positive;And if you're knowledge of John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby, or other family friendly movies, then you must prepare yourself for Pink Flamingos.<br /><br />Explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unsanitary acts with chickens are just a mere portion of some of the depravity in this movie.
negative;:-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because I was laying out a newsletter on my laptop when it came on some cable channel late one night.
negative;The backstories, agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese, shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them.
negative;When many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are taken into questioning.
positive;"And he plays Hari Om impeccably- from his absolutely perfect ""Bollywood e-shtyle"" to his awkward, shy manner with a first kiss."
negative;Not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he directed!
negative;I can go through this kind of mind**ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in e.g.
positive;The show's writers, cast and crew have proven themselves the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre.
positive;It gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved.
negative;The thunderclap occurs about an hour into the film, when Raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses.
negative;And Trivett is the ultimate clown in black-face.
negative;Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to full Technicolor.
negative;Definitely to avoid.
positive;Certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered Trenet and Aznavour.
positive;Its not only creative but its also fun.
negative;It made no sense.<br /><br />And again, how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote Mt.
positive;Their scenario parts and their actors both do extremely well, providing us with a bracing feel - right after the episode, you'll realize that the show really needed people just like that.
positive;And Harry Crystal lives that belief.
negative;I will never forgive you in this life or the next(which is not looking good from my newfound beliefs) .
positive;And sure it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot.
positive;Really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry.
positive;Check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!
positive;One wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of white-black relations (if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early, they must of left dumbfounded, if not offended).
positive;"Breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive, lizard-brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two ""cattle"" (as Hitchcock called actors) a love-scene of searing intimacy."
negative;Burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective (just increasingly annoying, because nothing important ever seems to get said).
negative;His affected British accent is terrible and he portrays Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century.
negative;"And the strip scene with Mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all; perhaps the director likes this sort of thing.<br /><br />Plot logic: when Memphis and Mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why doesn't Mark Lester's mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loonies drive it off?"
positive;In the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull.
positive;As for the fact that the comics do marry shrews, I suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve.
positive;Never had I seen such a powerful true story movie.
positive;The melodrama gets a bit thick, and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this film to the next level.
negative;<br /><br />The concert sequences just sucked.
positive;It was not without its problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the time period.
negative;"Every once in awhile I'll remember that I've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a cross between ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"
positive;Try to see it.<br /><br />
negative;Oh, Hell, why not save yourself the expense of a funeral?
positive;So well done.
positive;its witty, devilish, thrilling, comedic, and full of toasty action-packed goodness!
positive;This film seems like it will skirt both sides.
negative;I failed to understand the whole idea of it.
negative;The whole layout of the surrounding future world ?
positive;"A film much alike to David Mamet's ""House of game"" and stuff like that."
positive;Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way.
positive;So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road.
positive;But them 'Paches is pretty smart.
positive;Superb story that reels you into the movie, emotional, yet light-hearted.
negative;TWO THUMBS DOWN!
positive;"The particular theme of films this night was ""Neglected 70's Crime Films"" and boy was her right."
negative;This film has possibly, the worst title for a stooge short ever dreamed up.
positive;"It was shown at this year's Cannes festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program which offers ""original and different works"" outside the competition."
negative;Too bad they were in the wrong configuration.
negative;It's not a pleasant wait.
positive;Rocky Horror Picture Show fans, this film contains notable music, mind you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3.
negative;A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul.
positive;It's really, really a shame.
positive;Most Westerns use landscape as an awe-inspiring backdrop: there is little sense of actually living in the West.
positive;If you liked the first three then you'll love this, go watch it!
negative;If you 're not familiar with the original series, you won't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.The story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film.<br /><br />Kusama's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller , it's simply unworthy of the original √ÜON concept.<br /><br />Charlize Theron might be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the √ÜON character.
positive;It is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction.
positive;"This is certainly better than their original 1960's acid-trip film that was in it's place, is leagues better than ""Honey I Shrunk The Audience"" (and far more fun), barely squeaks by the MuppetVision 3-D movie at Disney-MGM and can even beat the original 3-D ""Movie Experience"" Captain EO."
positive;The Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc Set of this also holds nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a Play All function, about 38 minutes worth of BTS material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes.
negative;You would not believe, that this director earlier has made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun.
negative;"the costumes are perfect,good actors, there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful, and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey Lone Ranger alive, the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and those songs like ""The Man in the Mask"" are so bad that they are funny."
negative;Man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen.
negative;This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose.
positive;"Would we be dubbed as being ""off our rockers"" if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds?"
positive;"Then a series of events in his very ""white"" little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events."
negative;Cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field, control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves Control's past.
positive;what's great about speed racer is that you're never too old to watch it.
positive;Sometimes someone does something out there.
positive;A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man.
positive;This cast is far superior, as well.
negative;"He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like ""blow their brains out with guns"", and how ""God is in control when your born and when your die""."
positive;Go see his film Shades of Grey as well.
positive;Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help Davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head.
negative;Then, there was the cheapest video camera (which they used).
negative;The acting sucked.
positive;This character is really unforgettable, too.<br /><br />Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is the uncorrupted morality, nor by power or love or hate.
positive;The sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut, it has since become a Classic in it's own right.
negative;The problem is that Lenzi lets us get a good, long look at the cannibal feast scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season STAR TREK episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots.
negative;While everyone else was solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the English word faster.
negative;"There's ""The Gay Guy,"" (Pawel Szajda as ""Ricky,"") who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned, and ""The One Who Knows What's Going On."""
positive;><br /><br />It was entertaining and was just what I needed.
positive;"The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, yet still has that commercial edge - an ""indie"" movie for the masses if you like."
negative;"Of course, before that it has the clich√© ""You really believe that?"
positive;Having never seen it before I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what all the fuss was about.
negative;More dancing, and a scene of Angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak.<br /><br />The film muddles its way to a finish, and I heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
negative;The end of the movie just seems to implode on itself.
positive;The film gives a very good and believe appearance to it's characters, especially Pacino.
positive;and is certainly NOT an artistic triumph.
negative;brr... terrible!<br /><br />This movie had great potential.
negative;He finds out the hotel is over-insured.
positive;Why it isn't available on DVD yet is a mystery and a tragedy.
positive;Fonda and Douglas are sent on a routine assignment at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film.
negative;For a B-actor, I must admit I really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills...
negative;I asked myself if the plot wasn't about the action but about the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found that the character was inconsistent - either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother.
negative;Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing.
negative;For an amazing serial killer film check out Se7en if you have not done so.
positive;A most meaningful film and a must see.<br /><br />please note the date of this review.
negative;It is pure TV movie hell, the cast doesn't seem all that bad, but they act terribly.
negative;4/10
positive;portrayal of lesbian women is delicately handled and well done.
positive;official who seems to be a Cheney clone.
negative;The critics and the public got this one right back then - it was lambasted and a box-office disaster, and rightfully so.
negative;How it got released to every major cinema no idea.
negative;They spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller.
negative;That information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever.<br /><br />*That said I did like a couple of parts right in the middle.
positive;This era was not just the dawn of sound in cartoons, but of a cartoon character which would go down in history as the world's most famous mouse.
positive;the Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic.
positive;Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught.
negative;To identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct.
positive;They answered to 'The Commander', played by the late Noel Coleman.
positive;"Some critics were harsh on Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995, deeming that she was ""flat"" or ""dull"" in the role."
negative;(1) Her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and(2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film).
positive;Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
negative;Surveillance only wishes it were Natural Born Killers... in fact, it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was.
negative;Any Tom and Jerry is funnier, heck even funerals are funnier.<br /><br />Just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the Stooges' performances: It's three guys behaving, running, even talking like retarded infants, causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem, with no plot, no real purpose, and no real conclusion.
negative;Not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else.
positive;has to be the best of its genre.<br /><br />It is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times.<br /><br />I would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day.<br /><br />It is a shame that the DVD doesn't have any extras but as they didn't have DVDs when this was filmed that is understandable.
positive;People and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape.<br /><br />In 1979 Herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
negative;Also living in Pia's mansion is Horatio (the sexy but dumb Al Cliver), a mystique who speaks nothing but nonsense.
positive;"Less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH should not be really be compared with such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, or PSYCHO; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST."
positive;"Interestingly, there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times.<br /><br />By 1934 director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the Poverty row side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies, and ""The Ghost Walks"" was one of them."
negative;Not so fast Bucky.
negative;Come on, just be realistic at least.
negative;Who am I to say they aren't?
negative;Many scenes are very unrealistic, and the acting is quite poor.
negative;After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate.
negative;The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original.
negative;Another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter.
positive;How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris?
positive;Strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though I wonder how this great German director felt about being given this job.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting.
positive;In fact Rising Damp should have been made as a film just so Rossiter could have been eligible for an Oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent.
negative;Admittedly, I only watched about two hours at the most of it, but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy had portrayed her characters, and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing.
positive;I absolutely love this film.
positive;"The opening at CERN where the ""God Particle"" or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie."
negative;Sleep or play solitary are best choices.
negative;Please, even if your life depends on it, DO NOT, and I repeat: DO NOT under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage.
positive;If you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere.
negative;Nothing interesting happens.
positive;Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go.
positive;Both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away.
negative;This movie isn't scary at all!
negative;Neither were the characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin adequately portrayed.
negative;Another stinker from the PM Entertainment group, and thankfully one of their last.<br /><br />'Firetrap' is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'The Towering Inferno' I don't mind Low budget B Movies as long as some effort is put into them - there is no effort whatsoever in 'Firetrap' is stars Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here and that's saying something, the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps.
negative;"Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" clich√© horror with a more thriller-like pacing."
negative;I don't know who was in charge of special effects, but I could have done better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder that doesn't have a battery.<br /><br />9.
positive;Juhi chawla does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny deol plays the hero and action man.
positive;That was us up there on the screen.
positive;The thirteen-minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker I'm not terribly familiar with, though 'The Blues Brothers (1980)' is a classic, and I hear that 'An American Werewolf in London (1981)' is a stupendously entertaining horror/comedy.<br /><br />Whether or not 'Thriller' actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate, taking into account its extensive length {though Jackson bettered this effort with 1997's 'Ghosts,' at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song comprises less than half of the total running time.
positive;On a trivia note is Character Actor and Dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985).
negative;Naraku has just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world.
negative;It's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though.
positive;<br /><br />Besides Heifetz, one thing the film does do is touch on, albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses.
positive;If you shoot him now, things will quiet down.
positive;"The south-supporting ladies find a badly wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends.<br /><br />Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed."
negative;That is, however, IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation.
positive;Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993.
negative;That's a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash.
negative;Jane brings out the humanity in him, and he brings out the untamed side of her.
negative;Without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though Lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved.
positive;For me TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn`t need tissues it needs insulin .
positive;"""Black Water"" is a movie that in a way surprised me, and definitely exceeded my original expectations."
negative;"This ""film"" would make Helen Keller get up and walk out of the theater.<br /><br />6."
negative;This was probably one of Irwin Allen's Biggest films and I think he thought a lot of it .
positive;I realise how he felt.<br /><br />Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene.
negative;"A pretentious but - to varying degrees - watchable collection of mostly pointless ""stories"".<br /><br />But let's start from the top.<br /><br />Kaurismaki: If one ever wondered what Finnish love/romance was like, perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication."
negative;That's fine.
positive;Many of us will miss his off-balance humor.
positive;Aside from the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of the piece, as Sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who, rest assured, gets everything that's coming to him.
negative;These guys could make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck!<br /><br />After that hellish obstacle is fixed, Masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away.
positive;"The story ends with a movement to the next thing, as distinct from resolution, which isn't the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise."
positive;Bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as Corrina.
positive;I found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between Ford's and Thomas's lives as they first found out about, and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with, their spouses' deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people.
negative;Heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie.<br /><br />Overall, this movie makes even the worst of Scifi Channel movies looks fantastic.
positive;Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham.
negative;It looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house.
negative;There is even no Typical horror clich√©s,too.
positive;I just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost), because this movie takes full advantage of that format.
positive;It also made me cry.
negative;However, I finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances.
positive;So when DEADLY VOYAGE a made for TV film by the BBC and HBO based on a true story I vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the TV schedules I sat down waiting to be bored senseless .
negative;I think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of Lenzi's films looking for something new by the formidable director.
positive;even if you think no, i'm not going to watch a film from dad's time.
positive;He works in a foundry where he hits red hot metal into shape (an early joke about Langdon - he is a small, light man, not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer).
positive;half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright's involvement with Dana Andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...This is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the Indianapolis 500...The characters in the movie are the typical post WWII Americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their lives...Happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice!
negative;A lot, a lot!
negative;The love that Ray and Pooja feel for one another, as well as the almost giddy closeness of the family unit, is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality.
negative;The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes.
negative;"I listened to rap and R&B growing up, but the group ""Immature"" never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player."
positive;Whatever you think, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
positive;Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality.
positive;The story of two brothers who meet after the War between the States and end up on different sides of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless, and the shootouts and the atmosphere are great.
positive;It was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />This is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely.
positive;The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling.
positive;I keep notes on all the films I see and rate them.
positive;Fonda plays a TV reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist but is only allowed to be a TV reporter.
positive;Later Tommy gets himself into some real trouble when he disobeys orders in an effort save his buddy.<br /><br />This film is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that held my interest and top-notch performances by all.
negative;I began watching this movie on t.v.
negative;A well-heeled London solicitor, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident.
positive;and when we do its no where near as good as this games.
positive;Seen all 4 installments, this one is by far the best of all.
negative;<br /><br />-VIVIAN is 19.
negative;Simply put, this film is so bad that I almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it.
negative;The screening I caught this at had the director and cast in attendance.
negative;for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.<br /><br />I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part.
positive;I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs.
negative;DON'T WATCH THIS.
negative;(Hamilton Ontario???)
positive;Witherspoon is wasted in this role.
negative;I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull.
positive;I want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on N.Y. streets, circa 1959 & experience a time I've only seen on film & in photographs.
negative;And I guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times.
positive;Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds.
positive;Totally different than anything I had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind.
positive;Without giving the plot away, this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story.
positive;I feel sort of the same way about slasher movies.
positive;Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background at the top, as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance.
positive;Even years later, I remember this movie well.
positive;The special effects are awesome, but what is even better is the writing.
negative;"The plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of acting at times it begged the question to be asked, ""Why are we doing this?""."
negative;I rented the DVD because I thought it was all stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short was SMA, the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action.
positive;Also worth a look for fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin.
negative;Towards the end of the movie I still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity.
positive;It's a remarkable piece of work, that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist, people leaping out of bath tubs, or superheros coming to save the day.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot.<br /><br />If you watch this film, and are not impressed.....
positive;The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating.
negative;John Garfield, Jr. looks a bit like his father, but not as interesting.
negative;If we don't, the gag, like the movie, falls flat.<br /><br />There are action scenes naturally.
negative;That about sums it up.
positive;"""L'appartement"" sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end."
negative;And only two parts made me collapse with laughter.
negative;But, if you feel Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.<br /><br />There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome.
negative;"The ""heroine"" seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of Judy Garland, the ""hero"" is bland as white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene out of the deal."
positive;(It's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin).
negative;The twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it.
positive;Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing.
negative;"""Harry & The Hendersons"" (1987) was the first big budgeted film to use Bigfoot, with a terrific creature design by Rick Baker."
positive;It isn't pretty.
positive;Every critic panned Chris Farley and David Spade's movies.
negative;Clue: If you think the former, you've picked up the wrong movie from Blockbuster.
negative;In fact, the narration was the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious I have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over-the-top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it.
positive;Everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what's more likely more then one person.<br /><br />Lastly, the music used is just great(a lot of Cars, u2,lots of obscure(now) songs from the 80's.-an 80's purist's dream.
negative;I would have given this LESS than a 1 rating if it were possible.
positive;Only recently (e.g., Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.
negative;This ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK in that, anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given.
negative;The CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the Sci-Fi channel and the writing was pathetic.
negative;What happened to white go-go boots?
positive;For Storyteller adicts, it features The Man Himself introducing the myths, the lion from 'True Bride,' and... No Annoying Opening Theme!
positive;Of course, it's the guy that likes to collect eyeballs, and he's got quite a collection going.
positive;I can go on, but I won't gush too much more.<br /><br />This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture.
negative;Rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone else the favor.
positive;"It's clear enough early in the film that Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the ""unpatriotic"" elements of American society."
positive;<br /><br />As with any TV series, there are episodes that shine and those that don't.
positive;The whole time you are watching it you are thinking WTF?
positive;The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over.
negative;To begin, I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off.
negative;Terrible!
negative;Oh yes, I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash.
positive;With her beauty, she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history.
positive;Benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell.
negative;Jjaks wakes up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her.
negative;This is one of the hardest to watch films ever, There are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written, badly acted line.
negative;I didn't want it to suck.
positive;"Not equally ingenious as ""Pulp Fiction"" but things seem much more natural in ""The Apartment""."
negative;I found out it was Flex like hours after watching the movie.
positive;Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of fame, hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment.
positive;Most of the ones by Christopher Guest such as: Best in Show, For your Consideration, A Mighty Wind, and Waiting for Guffman
positive;This leads to the bitter, grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender.
negative;A bit unbelievable when the POWs use camp made re-breathers to swim between the POW camp and the Filipino village, every night.
positive;Had it not been for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous.
positive;A great film for fans of true to life problems befalling believable families.
positive;His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist.
positive;Well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected.
negative;Just didn't have any meaning to it I could see.
positive;Surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.
negative;It deserved only 3 out of 10!
negative;There were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more.
negative;Or what if blacks made a movie glorifying the Nat Turner Rebellion?
negative;It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society.
positive;It was unforgettable.
positive;His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing.
negative;Like Linnea Quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint, 30 year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course... Rollerdisco!
positive;I suppose it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically.
negative;"anyhow, if you are out of options when it comes to finding new ""horror"" films that you haven't seen 1,000 times already, (as i was) and you are debating this one, i would still skip this."
negative;"There's also the painfully comic Maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as ""being effeminate in his pleasures"" in the annals).<br /><br />The interiors are rather meager and rely on clich√©s upon clich√©s."
negative;There is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters, and so suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no allure at all.<br /><br />The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, I was quite surprised.
negative;A Jewish girl's family is butchered, she goes into hiding, later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge.
positive;She rescues him and takes him back to the school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence so that he will be taken to prison, the headmistress, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their black servant Hallie (Mae Mercer), and the mostly teenage girls take him in, heal him, and fall under his spell.
negative;A policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping Luther, even though at one point he has a rifle squarely aimed at Luther while Luther clucks and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance.
negative;So he tries to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful.
negative;Sounds very good.
negative;He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all.
negative;"Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits."
positive;Finally I discovered what I thought I remembered as a four year old.
positive;"<br /><br />Some little touches that make this film undeniably Hitchcockian- the use of non-English dialog, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale in ""To Catch A Thief""); the use of foreboding, Arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; Stewart and Day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain."
negative;If it's not one of the Stooges, it's somebody.<br /><br />I was astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this.
positive;An absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden.
negative;"You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""."
negative;Yes, BLINKS!
positive;Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances.
negative;"In short, it is clearly one of the worst sci-fi movies of the 80's and I would be so bold as to say ""of all time""."
negative;this is by far the most pathetic movie Indian cinema or any cinema has come up with.it is totally a piece of crap.the story line odes not hold any water.
negative;No madder how much time is spent in mind over matter, benefit of a doubt, walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.<br /><br />The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eight grade.
positive;Vasili Merkuryev, as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance.
negative;This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability.
negative;Regardless of the nice cars in the film, or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie AND witnessing tool, Lay it Down hardly delivers.
positive;"I thought it was something along the lines of ""My great escape"", but I've searched on the internet, books, pretty much everything I could think of to try to, and I just can't find it anywhere."
negative;This film comes on.
positive;Yeah he went to that convention in SONS OF THE DESERT that ruined her plans, but he wanted to get some private time - there is nothing suggesting he and Stan cheated on their wives.
positive;When he comes back from the Foreign Legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed.
negative;"to ""I just killed 12 people and boy, are my arms tired."""
positive;Half Storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit.
negative;it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments.
negative;<br /><br />What's going on here?
positive;And for a catharsis junkie like me, that's about the best censorial experience I could ask for.
negative;But this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie.
negative;Some of the film was also shot in Jamestown, CA, very near Columbia.
positive;The music is great.
negative;Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage.
negative;"The film was ninth of twenty-two features produced by Haworth, each of which was tailored to Hayakawa's talents and to his stock company of Japanese actors."""
positive;"Unless you have something like Ray Bradbury's ""The Sound of Thunder."""
positive;"Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it is interesting to see him in an early role, or any role, where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic.<br /><br />Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as the headmistress, and I cannot imagine another actress of the time being as good in the role; a long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I don't think Laurie could have embodied the role in the same manner as Geraldine Page.<br /><br />Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the film ""A Patch of Blue"" as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter's character is another high point in her short career) is at her prime here, delicate and masterful at the same time."
positive;I didn't like the idea on how they thought Chris Hansen would do a show on tourettes and let a boy speak out and bash the Jews.<br /><br />One thing I did not like is how South Park thought that people with tourettes syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that.
positive;71 minutes of eye-candy (the plot, having something to do with nefarious derrings-do in ancient Egypt, is beside the point) offers the cinematographer and audiences the delectable sight of Debra Paget wearing an assortment of see-thru veils, most of which hit the ground when she shakes and shimmies thru a slave-girl production number unparalleled in film history.
positive;this movie is worth the time, if you haven't taken the time to see it do so the next time you rent a movie.
positive;You know what would be so great??
positive;Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera.
negative;Trash at its best.
positive;A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good.
negative;This man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared.
negative;Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude.
negative;Nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script.
positive;The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage.
positive;John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made.
negative;""", ""Sunset Boulevard,"" the Lana Turner LSD movie ""The Big Cube"" and the Manson murders, which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this so-called ""movie"" was made!"
positive;Let me depart from many comments I've read here, and say that this film ranks as one of the five best Bonds, along with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, Licence To Kill, and For Your Eyes Only (the ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around).
negative;Unintentionally Python-esque.<br /><br />On the positive side, I loved the background music.
negative;This movie actually almost made me cry.<br /><br />For starters the fake teeth.
negative;Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain.
positive;The soundtrack is enjoyable and adds flavor to the movie.
positive;Further, Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit, though).
positive;The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in the Zephyr Team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige.
negative;"The utter lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some ""progressive"" pseudo feminist.<br /><br />Saddest part of the whole show is that these women live unfortunate miserable lives."
negative;Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this point.
negative;If it were paced faster, it would be awesome, but they didn't (*sigh*)...Scares.

negative;Maybe James P. Lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises him.<br /><br />In 'Dreamland (2007)' however, he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no acting that deserves that name.<br /><br />In any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it, even a one minute one.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works!<br /><br />I actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the West.<br /><br />Recommend it only to your worst enemies!

positive;<br /><br />From the very beginning, it's clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date, starting off with a long back story, told through inter-titles, about the tragic love story of Carmen.
positive;The ending, however, is tense, stunning and effective.
positive;For the most part, I only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past.

negative;That being said, the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that I saw.<br /><br />Rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work, I will simply comment that nothing works.
positive;I thought this was a very good TV series and I would like to see it continue.

negative;I hope that when the next person wants to make a movie/series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did.
negative;It's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part I despise, by the way).
positive;Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character.
positive;Ward Bond portrays Elder Wiggs, the main voice for the Mormon group moving the wagon train to the Lord's destination.
negative;How can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic?
positive;"The quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from ""Dalmatians"" (with some nice nods to French Impressionism, it appears), and the villain here (the butler) is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well."

negative;Moore searches for him, is told at a hospital he is dead, then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited.<br /><br />It's a nice little romance, but hardly more than that.

positive;This is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever, maybe the best cartoon of all time.
positive;Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops.

positive;Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter.

positive;Thanks an adequate script, the film is pretty good but I was surprised to hear no French accents at all in the film even though it was supposedly about French people!
negative;What the (beep) is going wrong with Disney the last years?
positive;And naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve.<br /><br />Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it.
positive;In comparison to The Passion of the Christ, another recent film that people believed to be very Anti-Semitic, Merchant of Venice makes Passion look like a Jewish holiday.
negative;Makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie.
positive;i bought the film not so long after seeing it on TV, i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs.
positive;It's interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also a famous screenwriter as well as director).
negative;One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst.
positive;The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated.
negative;The film's exploitative violence, though, is often only shown in brief close-up, and never dwelt on for very long, which diminishes its effect (interpret that how you may).

positive;Thanks for making this film!

positive;"If you think piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film ""LA PIANISTE"" is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement, perversion and darkness, I've got news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's novel ""LA PIANISTE"" (on which the film was based) is twice as ""repulsive"", ""disgusting"", ""deranged"" and even more fascinating -- though there can't be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that Isabelle Huppert has reached here, above all other mortal actresses in activity today."
positive;Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching Bullitt.
positive;The entire cast manages to pull in a powerful performance despite a few lousy one-liners.
positive;And 1, for that matter.<br /><br />The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2.
negative;Obviously the majority of people watching this were going to be Jewish and Christian parents with their kids, so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people?
positive;Certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but Strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film.<br /><br />As written above, the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage.
positive;"Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of ""12 O'Clock High"") and his men boil in on horseback and capture Tucsos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of ""True Grit"") wants to shoot him on the spot."
negative;No I did it with free will.

negative;The same goes for the characters.
positive;It's definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />By the way, This is my first review, so I don't know if any of those things were spoilers..
negative;It was called Hex and a show from BBC.
positive;With a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information, given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is.
negative;Don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgement.
negative;Besides, she can sing and the busty well aging Peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots.
positive;The vampiric traits and weaknesses are, however, used in humorous ways, and created some uniquely entertaining bits.
positive;What's gonna happen next.... dude just get with the chick already.
positive;It has so many memorable performances and moments.
positive;He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.<br /><br />In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans.
positive;In Besson's and Jolivet's tale we see the new world from the eyes of Don Quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character.
negative;I don't care how much it costs or didn't cost to make, movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder.
positive;But also around this time I began to recognize that the more raunchy, mature, surreal, obscene, and (though I didn't know the term at the time) satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff I was used to.
positive;Had it not been for William Faulkner, perhaps To Kill a Mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow.<br /><br />I found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, To Kill a Mockingbird, may not have been as original as I'd always thought it was.
positive;David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same thing with their screenplay for Dad's Army and it worked superbly.
negative;All one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on, whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster (and he rarely does), he's not worth watching.
negative;I figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the Conan movies, but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that.
positive;"One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany, ""This is so... high school!"""

negative;The film meanders along but never builds any momentum.
positive;also the actor are really good but the girl is better.
positive;If Ann were in James' place, it would be shattering.
positive;Her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes, as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis.
negative;"Both ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" (1972) and the first film entitled ""Sasquatch"" (1978) have become minor cult classics, but neither were very memorable."
negative;I bet the director was either mega-stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every David Bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap.
negative;<br /><br />Any positives other than David Hood the third... yes The aerial shots of London largely submerged were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story,if you'll forgive the expression, as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage.
negative;My opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but, this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a British film industry in existence.
negative;The DVD sound track is horrible.
negative;Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the pacific northwest in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains.

negative;"But their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a ""Home Alone"" scenario to them.<br /><br />""Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver"" is much more goofy than the first too."
negative;The tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all.<br /><br />Even more over-the-top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous S/M crime belong to a large, yet secret, group of S/M lesbian executives.<br /><br />Full of bad editing and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations - including Barkin's detective salary apartment.
negative;The trouble is that our female supremo, whilst now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying over the fate of her two daughters who have taken a trip to South West London and haven't telephoned to say they were alright.

positive;The trauma, the suspense is just amazing.

negative;If talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over $100 lunches in swanky restaurants, indiscriminately shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male in site is considered empowering, the fate of western women may be doomed as we speak.<br /><br />Aside from the damage it does to the female gender, Sex and the City is NOT ENTERTAINING.

negative;I just saw this early this morning on the Fox channel quite by accident (my dog woke me up) - I had seen it years ago and thought I remembered it fairly well.
negative;The Alpha Video version I saw for this review was heavily edited, and one wonders cow much nekkid people were chopped out, not that it would have improved the film much.
positive;I wonder if Gabin was that lucky.
negative;"Second; A weak script that seems to be all over the place."
positive;The women and the music are beautiful.
positive;If you notice the early episodes of 30 Minute Meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years.
negative;I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.<br /><br />First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard.
negative;And the zooming into another scene, how terrible childish.<br /><br />The music is so badly chosen that it never adds something.
positive;I do think Josh Hartnett is good looking, but c'mon..Chris Klein is the most gorgeous man I think I have ever seen!!!
positive;Despite the overall bleakness of FM, the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit, belief that against all odds, life will persevere and possibly even flourish.<br /><br />Having finished writing this post, I referenced FM to discover that Herzog shot it in Saharan Cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup.
positive;In one of the most powerful episodes Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with Ullman's character that has been re-edited and distorted for political effect by one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene.<br /><br />
positive;This film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful film-making I've every seen.
negative;I won a free rental and chose this movie from Blockbuster.
positive;This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling.
negative;What?!
positive;From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home.
negative;The only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits.
positive;For those interested in race relations in the United States, and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process, it's well worth your time and effort to find this documentary.
negative;God bless Randy Quaid...his leachorous Cousin Eddie in Vacation and Christmas Vacation hilariously stole the show.
negative;Astaire is an ex-hoofer-turned-gambler who goes back to dancing to earn some money, getting mixed up in impersonating a letter-writing admirer to Hayworth's stone-cold society beauty.
positive;"A real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of Westerns in 1979-80, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American westerns were directed by European √©migr√©s), which seems a bit of an over-reaction.<br /><br />The plot is simplicity itself, as Martin Sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with Sam Waterston's nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time ""before the legends began."""
negative;"Also; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth."
positive;The acting was fantastic..especially Mari Blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester.
negative;The English subs talk much about life without death (is it possible?
positive;This was just the thing.<br /><br /> I found it informative (like the part about Keanu's neck...) and some of it was funny.
positive;if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself.
negative;And Van Devere is pretty good also.
positive;<br /><br />Ford's and Thomas's performances are believable and nuanced.
positive;And I guess that is about the highest compliment that I can pay to a film.<br /><br />
positive;You get that and then some.
positive;Being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for Ted, and he suffers professionally but also learns there's much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with, and really get to know, his own son.
positive;"The animation/CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case."
positive;Though not completely original--it owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it holds its own with a sense of humor, genuine creepy moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio, and the fun performances by Chuck Connors and the cast.
positive;The ending was indeed excellent and entertaining--so good that it elevated the film from a 6 to a 7.
negative;But like those shows, in the same way as those shows, Walker TR is just as insulting and just plain silly.
negative;They get PO'd at Sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at Mike that lands across his girlfriend Patty(Kristina Sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment.
negative;Now with the singing angle this could be a Hijacking, Let's Land the Plane Movie MUSICAL!
negative;Not really worth a review, but I suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around out there... Bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods.
positive;Since I don't watch TV, I watch at least 250 films a year, most on DVD.
positive;Thank you to the cast and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion.
positive;"The trailer trash chain smoking and binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorbike so that she can get away from ""all this crap"", her corpulent and mostly silent boyfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but rather absent-minded mother, members of a brass band whose skill improving efforts at home aren't getting a favorable reception neither from their families nor their neighbors, the depressed Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant customer on his way to ""a very important business meeting"", an elderly man having a nightmare about bombers in the skies, a young girl dreaming about marrying the young rock star that she is so madly in love with."
negative;"So far each one has been as scary as an episode of ""In Search Of"" 3/10"
positive;"It isn't a glamorized, unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film ""Dahmer"" (2001) was."
negative;The director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesn¬¥t understand and he doesn¬¥t want to.
negative;This particular Sir Percy Blakeney appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and volatility.
negative;Okay.
negative;Doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared.<br /><br />The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©.
negative;The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot, and hates people don't hate India because it's hot (this point is covered several times).
negative;I know these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporanos and more...) but this movie is very bad, very bad.
positive;They could have spent the money elsewhere.
negative;I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities.
positive;<br /><br />But I'm so sick of bitching about this.
negative;Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should blast away any notion that Peru is a vacation paradise.
positive;She has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience.
negative;"It could of been better (especially in some parts), but it was ""okay""."
positive;When The Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a series of well-acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them.
negative;I had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movie...and I was right.
negative;I'll watch most anything, but this was unwatchable.
positive;With a change in setting or mood, the music also adapts, adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers.<br /><br />The whole idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to progress.
negative;Nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck.
positive;Its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are.
positive;This video is frightening and I highly recommend it if one can find it.
positive;So, no annoying people talking, as appears to be the norm in the 'talking-to-the-tv' age.<br /><br />All in all, a good premise and a competent delivery, given the intended goal.
negative;"Well, grown in 2 days: moost have od'ed on those Miracle Grow spikes...Anycow, it comes not from Hell, but from the grave of a fake native, Kimo(Greg Palmer, ""The Zombies of Mora Tau""), murdered by the native elders for hanging out with those awful American scientists."
negative;It had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say Castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.<br /><br />Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story.
positive;If comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly.
positive;While no one knows for sure this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of it but cannot prove it.
negative;It only destroys any accidentally created excitement.<br /><br />To finish it up, the fighting scenes... my 3 year old niece would make a better fighting scene.<br /><br />This movie is not even good for a laugh, it's just that bad...
positive;I consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless.<br /><br />To summarise, MR. BEAN is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family.
negative;This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film.
positive;Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his endearing personal character.
positive;I did'nt have much expectation when I got the DVD(3rd was such a drag), but to my delight this one was fast paced with some slick punch-lines.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.
positive;Of course the Road Runner is chased by the Coyote and of course the Coyote fails to catch the Road Runner with every new attempt.
positive;This is more than an adorable film, it has amazing cinematic techniques used, it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions, and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110-minute voyage.
negative;"""Believe in God or you will go to Hell!"""
negative;2 out of 10.
negative;Nicole Eggert didn't look the part, didn't act the part, and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide.
negative;When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash.
negative;The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played a normal, dramatic character.
positive;And all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheavals of that era, although many are just touched upon... as part of the tapestry.
negative;Because when the universe is collapsing, you get to decide if you want to be a part of it.<br /><br />She chooses yes.
negative;The cast was fantastic, but the movie itself was horrible.
positive;Very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked.
negative;WTF?!
positive;"And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say ""enough is enough,"" even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power?"
negative;It's the little side-incidents.
negative;I'm liking it so far!
negative;What's a giant mutant insect to do?
negative;Maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune.
positive;Part of the film's power lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters, forcing us to view the mythic struggles and quests in a different light.
negative;Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team, the Timber Wolves.
positive;I don't see much middle ground.
negative;This REALLY got me.
positive;And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary... We all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen.
positive;Merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable.
positive;Scheider reminds me a lot of, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer who beat the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie : tough durable and destructive.
negative;"With a MySpace URL and a mighty (if puzzlingly subjective) promise of preserving so-called ""old school American horror,"" ""Hatchet"" will draw a lot of curiosity seekers with its DVD release (where that claim is emblazoned on the disc itself)."
negative;The whole storyline is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution.
negative;This Spaghetti Western uses three American lead actors which takes away a little of the typical spaghetti aura.
negative;Every single time the characters move the camera is bouncing.
negative;It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film.
positive;The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewicz's utilization of the new technology seems like old hat.
positive;My wife & I just got married around the time this show started up!!
positive;This is a Black and White film from France,<br /><br />Simple plot, gangster on the run seeking & getting help etc.
positive;<br /><br />I have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women?
negative;Cast Luciano Pavarotti as the Pilot.
positive;She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life.
negative;The movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it's hilarious.
negative;The film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for Amanda Plummer that is downright humiliating).
negative;"The creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said ""let's make fun of the Russians and at the same time show people how advanced we (Americans) are""."
positive;No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than Herzog -- possibly this is where he feels most at home.
negative;Even the worst Van Damme movies make this look crappy.
positive;The drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist, as does another guy doing a magic trick, begging the question: what's with the goggles?
negative;5 Norton (former C action movies star ) does nothing but pose as an eccentric trendy weapon smuggler who traffics white slutty girls hand picked at a night club where they willingly follow some idiot posing as a millionaire snapping at them ( you reap what you sow ) 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first butchered cop is the former patrol teammate of the super-hero ( yaawn!
negative;Avoid at all costs even if you're family of David Bradley, you'll be glad you did, word.
negative;There was no plot, no tension, only a lot of boredom !!!
positive;I give this movie 5 stars out of 6.
positive;Maybe I'm psychic.<br /><br />It took a while to warm up to Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little leeway.
negative;Heh.
negative;Otherwise don't bother, it's not worth the effort.
negative;a beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her wealthy friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt.
negative;All of the story is told through painfully dull narration.<br /><br />The film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas.
negative;"But not in a ""cool"" way."
positive;<br /><br />The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker, sadly in his last film role, but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable, as the character is a marvel to behold.
positive;When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home.
positive;And not enough can be said about Peter O' Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave and Michael Bryant's acting.
negative;In a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting, Herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in San Francisco.
positive;There's one thing though, it's got to be one of the most jarringly, and intense thrillers I've seen in quite a while.
negative;WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag?
positive;"The AFT had no grounds to storm the compound; it was the AFT that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men, women, and children!!"
positive;Some things are unrealistic.
negative;My vote 1/10 (it would have been zero).
negative;A president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel.
negative;I have already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of 'fussy mother' (yes, thats as far as character development and back-story goes), but I was impressed by the actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast, having appeared in everything from classic movies such as Richard Attenborough's 'Oh What a Lovely War', and 'The Eagle Has Landed', and TV including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s, Star Trek, and even going to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in 1995s Judge Dredd) whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers I have met - often incapable men, whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak.
positive;Sure the ending was expected, but I feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members.
positive;It gives you almost no spoilers, but it is great to have if you are a Matrix Head like me.<br /><br /> There is no spoon.
negative;Everything in this production is amateurish.<br /><br />Always a joy to watch, Mary McDonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation.
negative;"Minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this ""civil-war love story""."
negative;Or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - that 'rock' band Brian Austin Green is in is really terrible, I think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents.
negative;Please, stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel.
negative;And yes, I'm sure there will be responses to this about how his conscious got to him, but come on.<br /><br />The main character crawled out the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him.
negative;He didn't, really.
positive;It's the best proof that the series, ingoing its 4th season, is still alive and kicking hard.<br /><br />Although the producers don't amaze us with some more flash-forwards this time, the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying, as it brings some shocking facts.
positive;"Lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his ""love story in the city of dreams"" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs.<br /><br />The acting is top rate, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn/Betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance."
positive;<br /><br />Tony Lo Bianco is very good as Vito the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off Buddy and the mob to the point that leads to Buddy's partner Ansel getting killed.
negative;This documentary primarily aims for the horror-loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already, haven't we?
positive;Her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona.
positive;This is about as far as I can follow the analogy.
negative;This could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting, filmstock and editing<br /><br />Destined to be a time-filler on Sci-fi channel, when they've overused everything else from their library, and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream.
negative;"Be warned, the next time you see ""Richard Kelly"" involved in any production, run away."
negative;If necessary I will die on this journey to see her dreams realized.
positive;"I haven't heard dialogue this good since ""Blake's 7."""
positive;The romance between Tromeo and Juliet was believable, and erotic, not pulled off by many adaptations.
negative;I would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though.
positive;"<br /><br />At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called ""boloney""."
negative;I'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time: Don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay, then 5 minutes finishing the rest.
positive;The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and I think that is a mystery in itself.
negative;One positive note, that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values.
positive;Just Go see this movie.
positive;"This ""childrens"" film has excellent morals and shows teamwork."
negative;And if you insist on watching this, do so with the sound turned off - save your eardrums.
positive;Troma at its best, this film really is a gem, and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time.
negative;Not one of director Roger Corman's best.
positive;"Recently, my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like ""Raging Bull"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but this time my VCR took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of Lionel Jeffries' ""The Railway Children""."
negative;If you want a movie that drags you into darkness, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
positive;The creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all.<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />The game is still intact, the jokes are here, folks.
positive;FAITHFULLY!!
negative;This made me go 'What the F**K.' <br /><br />-There is no 'Kelly' in the movie.
positive;One thing I love about this movie is the direction, because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations.
positive;The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing.
negative;Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family!
positive;I think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has.
negative;This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire.
negative;Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time?
positive;Oh sure, it follows the storyline of now having Popeye in the U.S. Navy.
positive;Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris.
negative;Dialogues in this flick just killed me.
positive;This movie has made a HUGE impact on me and I plan on buying a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library.
negative;I give it a 2 for using London as a location, which is a nice change, for Gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on London and the gates).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one.
positive;This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans.
positive;(strong) A
negative;This is very silly because it once again makes Kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything.
negative;OK, yes I know I'm a Philistine, and I have no knowledge of, nor love for opera.
negative;You could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably.
positive;Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple.
negative;Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic.<br /><br />There were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers, but that isn't even worth mentioning.
negative;One day, a rebel who wishes to marry the princess decides that it's time they ventured into the cursed land to claim it for the king and the king agrees, when they reach the land the king is captured by the beast and the rebel returns home to lie to the kingdom that the king has been captured and killed.
negative;At first I thought perhaps that when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer, they might have reversed two of the reels.
negative;Without a doubt, this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) CGI.
positive;A man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems.
positive;To say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it...if you are into creepy, Gothic tales, find it and rent it.
negative;"By this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'Herbie Rides Again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to the return of Jones's typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast's frantic mugging."
positive;Teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining.
positive;"Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out.<br /><br />Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in '40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth)."
positive;How many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class Dad mixing it with the flower children aagh!
positive;This movie, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me, features two well-known Hong Kong pop stars.
negative;Along the way, she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be Orson Welles' brother and he later takes a header off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie.<br /><br />This is a strange little film that is very cheaply made--and it sure shows.
negative;The Boyfriend: He's just around to co-exist with The Final Girl until his demise.
negative;"Go Rent ""Circle of Iron"" or ""The Killer Shrews"" instead."
negative;Yes, I'm amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage.
negative;see, this movie is really terrible, the acting is pretty good, but the casting is awful gear and Willis did their best to play these characters they simply cant play.
positive;Bonham's genius shines more on this DVD then on any album with Zeppelin, the Band of Joy or Lord Sutch.
negative;Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal.
positive;You will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve.
positive;Great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be miss-interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience.
positive;Jacobi's rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge.
positive;Now that's a utopia worth building.
positive;Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby.
positive;I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally got around to watching it.I really enjoyed watching this film as you don't get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this.
positive;Very new to Americans then....REMEMBER THAT!!
positive;Had it not been for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, the acting here would be much more lauded.
negative;Okay, I'm sorry to the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've seen yet...First off, the acting was okay.
positive;"I mean, ""Best"" has everything."
negative;I can only assume that his recent cornea transplant was a success then.<br /><br />Watch the trailer as thats a warning as to how bad this film is.
negative;Probably the worst film I've ever seen.
negative;All these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a movie theater.
positive;Behind that pass there is the whole 'Pache nation.
positive;"The taut filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people most remember about the film of course, and indeed it's pretty remarkable; but I liked the half-completed location of the final shootout, once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portrayal gritty sides of Paris in stark black and white; and Servais' channeling of both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in his spare but brutal performance.<br /><br />Perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought-provoking; George Auric's at turns modernist, romantic, and jazzy score is another highlight."
positive;I cannot recall any other TV series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc) that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking (at times) and suspenseful ride.<br /><br />I think that at the end of the fourth season, things were finally becoming tightly focused and I am shocked at the decision to cancel the series.
positive;Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story, even when viewed over 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique.
positive;Look at how perfect that pie is, but go back and look at the cake Betty makes.
negative;That's the case here.
negative;Well acted, yes.
positive;I thought I read here that there is sometimes an assumption that *Revenge of the Rats* is a sequel.
positive;"name acronym on the headboard of Bugs's bed <br /><br />2/ Bugs Bunny's short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor <br /><br />3/ When Nero the Lion calls his friend the Elephant for help, Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the Elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse, he uses Nero as a broom!"
negative;Just a couple of minutes later, we then see that particular scene.
positive;If you enjoy suspense this movie has it.
negative;If you are desperate enough or a Hackman freak see it otherwise don't!<br /><br />Live well and prosper
positive;"But if you like a good soap as I do, ""The Best of Everything"" will more than satisfy you."
negative;Not once has it been funny, captivating, exciting or original.
negative;Also, CBS put out a miniseries on JPII that is better than ABC by far.
negative;By the way, Did I mention that this movie sucked.
negative;"<br /><br />Everything in ""Paranormal State"" is short-handed into half hour, ""Dog the Bounty -- er, Ghost Hunter"" blocks."
positive;It was an ideal embodiment of impermanence.
positive;This Italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish-creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure-hunting, a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists!
negative;Director Fabio Barreto got a strange Academy Nominea for his last movie O Quatrilho.
positive;"I think the use of a ""fake"" war makes the film timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the film relevant to everyone."
negative;Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-reliant to be doing the dreamy-eyed, pouting, unrequited love bit, more appropriate to lovelorn school kids than the parents of four grown children.
negative;I watched this knowing it would be bad, but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of.
negative;As an homage to Underdog, it is even worse.
negative;This is a far cry from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him.
negative;The dialog and plot are about as complex as that of a Dr. Sues book.
negative;The rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the B-film qualities that some of us cherish.<br /><br />I recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it is almost nonexistent.
positive;The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers.
negative;This contains some spoiler information, but the movie is not worth watching anyway...<br /><br />Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer-director Damian Harris is beyond me.
negative;He is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that I can't tell you.
negative;When a Bogart lookalike--asking a question about a falcon--is the best joke, what follows is anemic indeed.
positive;She becomes a stalker/lunatic/nut-job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after he's done with her.
positive;Unfortunately, it was not networked.
negative;"It's weird, this film; you get the impression that the makers of this snooze-fest spent more time in the local bars than on set."
positive;Mute Witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves.
positive;I very nearly did not see 'Hi-De-Hi!'.
positive;Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts.
positive;"The amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it: Soon, much sooner than you realize, you too will find yourself saying, ""Is that Meat Loaf?"
positive;The endings of both versions leave room for interpretation.
negative;I should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15-minute mark.<br /><br />To Lynch's credit, she did manage to interject many things that make a good film: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors.
positive;"This movie takes a handful of ticked-off young film makers and clearly and cleverly shows the ""why"" of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the Waldo film."
positive;Now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn't very good, especially at the beginning.
positive;If only there were more genius' like justin out there!
positive;Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks.
negative;Like Camp Rock.
positive;It's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place!
positive;It's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where I live.
positive;It is a definite guarantee.
positive;It is an innovative means of conveying a shift in the `reality' of the moment, and works beautifully.
positive;"Along the way, they also encounter ""Doctor"" A Locksley Hall and his ""Hoochey Koochey Wagon"" and lend them help.<br /><br />Lovingly directed by Ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail."
negative;This is one entertaining flick.
positive;On the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, I think there was some overkill in this department.
negative;All the actors stay true to the script.
negative;That was worse than this, quite a bit worse: but it did have one thing: it had beautiful women in negligees wresting each other -- for about 20 minutes.
positive;We all seem to be in agreement.
negative;My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count.
negative;Her father and mother and 2 other siblings died in the movie.

negative;"Maybe that's how the book goes, but for as long as I can remember the first utterances of Tarzan were ""Me tarzan, you Jane""."
negative;The entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor.
positive;In many ways the film resembles 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening sequence.
negative;She represents everything that is wrong with American woman.
negative;No.<br /><br />Acting, corny and rubbish.<br /><br />Sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.<br /><br />Cinematography.
positive;Camilla Belle did really well in this movie, and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her.
positive;Memories, tapes, and reruns on CourtTV just aren't the same as watching it come on every Friday.
negative;Perhaps you could steal her from me, marry her, give her the babies and the picket-fenced home she yearns for.
positive;What a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true .
negative;)<br /><br />And where was the Mod in that Squad?
negative;"I have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the Poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. """

positive;Normally I try to avoid Barbie films, but this one was unmistakably awesome.
positive;It is now, by far my favorite movie of all time.
negative;"When I saw promos for A&E's ""Paranormal State"" I knew I was going to watch."
negative;There was no story to be told, just a show off of acting, technique, beautiful scenes - that were all EMPTY.
negative;If you watched Pulp Fiction don't see this movie.
positive;It went downhill when Cadell left to return to the theatre though.
negative;She shows a little too much flesh in this movie, something Davis and Crawford would never have done.
negative;This well researched film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats.
negative;Exactly the sort of film the Irish Film industry shouldn't be making.
positive;"<br /><br />Gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in, although he gets to do the ""right thing"" in the end.<br /><br />I found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject."
negative;As I write this user-comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sweeney Todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of Oscar nominations if I'm not mistaken.
negative;I'll review this film version solely on its own merits, as I don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.<br /><br />The film's opening credits are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting.
positive;However, thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script, this one is a joy to watch.
negative;Both films were targeted at family friendly audiences, thus inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone.
negative;In fact, the whole bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious that they make the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison.
negative;The only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why.
positive;I think this is the first REAL director's cut I've ever seen.
positive;In the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention.
positive;In this respect the film pales in comparison to Rising Damp's brilliant series.
negative;).<br /><br />Some new stuff is doing well (the Olaf character, sometimes, like with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, SMS -not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: does anyone know imagination?).
positive;And I also liked hearing from Otto Frank.
positive;Furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the FBI stormed Mount Carmel Center and when the building was burning.
negative;As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films.
negative;To top it off, the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity.
positive;It's not a children's movie.
negative;"By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here.<br /><br />One of the other users commenting on this states ""This is a Classic film and should be ENJOYED and not picked apart""."
positive;"A new movie that's in the making, called ""Dreamseller,"" is in production, which is about the story of Novak's dreams, shattered by his addiction."
negative;As soon as the movie starts, you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected, and you will be right.<br /><br />In the first half hour, it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable U.F.O.
positive;John Cusack stars as Hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies.Believe it or not Demi Moore is his co star...If you love the eighties,grew up around that time,or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh.Wait until you see the cartoons..what a riot....
negative;The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really.<br /><br />Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico.
negative;A guy in a rental recommended it.
positive;Slightly forced at times.<br /><br />Kudos on Dax Shepard in this one.
negative;"Most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end, a speech in which Raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) lectures us all on the verities of parent/child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least.<br /><br />""Baghban"" is a sappy, corny saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king-sized box of See's chocolates."
negative;They aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes?
positive;As for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was a lot better than I'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.
negative;The performances are horrible by pretty much everybody.
positive;But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary.
negative;The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily.
negative;But after the kind of funny introduction of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story turned out kinda dull.
negative;The Jackass: Sure, he looks pretty, but he's the idiot in the movie that's inserted purely to be an idiot.
negative;"I have never wished I could be watching a movie with Dean Cameron in it instead of what I was watching in my life, but ""Ski School"" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes all unleash their Tupperware tits<br /><br />Where I saw it: Starz on Demand"
positive;She, herself, was pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot--and the novice director was unsure, fairly green, and having great difficulties with all the decisions, logistics, etc.
positive;Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I've read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes.
positive;The question, however is: Did Hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment, or did he make self-justice?
positive;I thought I would be worn out watching the movie again, toughing it out just to look for the added scenes.
positive;Second, Christopher Doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame.
positive;Suspend belief and spend a couple of hours watching this, you will be glad you did.
negative;"When the twists and turns finally revealed themselves, rather than saying ""Ahh, I get it!"""
negative;"Somewhat fitting, given the actual fifteen minute content.<br /><br />I can do without any of the ""Shemp A.D."" stuff, but I will admit to having a few LOL moments from the two-man comedy offered by Moe and Larry in some of the new footage (and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all, considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs).<br /><br />Another bright spot to this and the last A.D. debacle ""Commotion on the Ocean"" is the decided lack of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head."
positive;I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend.
positive;), but it's Sandvoss who has become something of a gay icon, with his sensitive portrayal of a sweet-natured innocent whose journey from Darkness into Light leads to a startling revelation about his place in the world around him.
positive;Around the time of Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even The Maxx were hitting TV sets via MTV, USA put out two shows- one of them was Weird Science, and the other was Duckman.
positive;<br /><br />Well after I finished 15 Park Avenue, there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me.

negative;When they fell in love.
positive;The tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.<br /><br />Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines a fellow agent with whom Horrigan develops a grown- up relationship.
negative;things that Grange Hill was doing better when my parents were young!
positive;There is a sublime scene reminiscent of A CANTERBURY TALE, when jewellery left as a trap by White Bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind: there is a haunting, tingling, magical, thrilling effect more reminiscent of the Arabian Nights than a horse opera.
negative;When Luther steals the boyfriends motorbike the movie takes a turn for the worse.
negative;This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen.
negative;He even made the awful Vegas Vacation at least worth a look.<br /><br />I will say that he tries hard in this made for TV sequel, but that the script is so NON funny that the movie never really gets anywhere.
negative;It's like, nobody looked like they were supposed to except for Joseph Jackson.
positive;I give it 10/10.
negative;- The directing: well let's say, I bet it wasn't Hitchcock.<br /><br />Then to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved wath so ever.
negative;MILD SPOILERS !!!
negative;After tying up the hijacker, despite several bus-loads of people on this jumbo jet, nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them.
positive;It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.
negative;"""Cinecolor"" to be exact."
negative;Couldn't guess the end.
positive;However the croc's attacks are very unpredictable(which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly), and this does make you jump.
positive;The cast was amazing.

negative;Okay, I guess.

positive;Arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant.
negative;I don't recommend anybody to watch this.
positive;This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir.
negative;Weber took this poor, naive (although incredibly handsome) teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the Midwest, brought him to live in his home, and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them full-frontal nudes, all through Johnson's teenage years.
positive;The music is fantastic, and once more Michael Haneke puts reality in the big screen.
positive;I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it!
negative;Arnold, doesn't look like he belongs in this one, why he agreed to play the role is beyond me.
positive;Though not 'restored' its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from nuisance black-spots (dirt) and drop-outs.

positive;There's at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary.
negative;"Were it not for the fact that this came as a 2-dvd set paired with the original American Graffiti; were it not for the fact that I've been here in Iraq for several months and, at this point, will watch pretty much anything, I would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes."
negative;As someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation by IBM makes perfect sense--if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if thus and so conditions are reached, then do thus and so--in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that Kasparov created in game 2 ever happened.
positive;I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin.
positive;As he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life.
positive;<br /><br />Director Lieberman, who gave us such great B films as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well.
negative;Hayakawa also falls in love with Peil's daughter Tsuru Aoki (Ume-Ko), believing she's the reincarnation of his long lost princess.
negative;It remains on the surface all the time.
negative;Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set.
negative;BANDIDOS none of the characters in this film was likable for me.<br /><br />Apart of the weak content which targets certain customers this film is well shot, sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average.
negative;There are some moody B&W shots here and there that don't completely suck.
negative;Really amazing B, I mean, Z film.<br /><br />The plot are bad, clich√© and bad wrote.

negative;Once again there are the occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings.
positive;While today most people don't remember McKinley nor remember that he was assassinated, the film is set in this interesting time period.
negative;What makes this movie so damn bad?
negative;The film is highly unoriginal.
negative;It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie.
negative;He has become lazy and can't be bothered to write anything interesting, either for his own movies or a collection such as TMO.
positive;"With an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes's Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dream, myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit-part Hollywood actress/waitress, Diane Selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to hotshot director Adam Kesher.<br /><br />The film effectively takes place in Diane's drug-fueled head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her wish-fulfillments, regrets, obsessions and fears."
negative;This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, nice right?
positive;It always escapes me why she was never credited?
negative;Any screenplay you might have thought of using to<br /><br />line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad.
positive;Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls.
negative;It's like they took the names from the show, and cut out all that made it good in the first place.<br /><br />The poster hides Carell's face beyond that of Hathaway's.
positive;Our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph, to vanquish, to change his world (for the better) back into a world of plenty that no longer exists.<br /><br />We look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans-as-animals.
negative;She was quite beguiling in appearance here, but I still didn't buy her as a spy.<br /><br />I couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - I'm always shushing everybody).
positive;I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset.
positive;His thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past-tense, narrated style that accurately explains much of Dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times.
negative;What else can I say?
positive;"If you enjoy films like ""Valley Of The Dolls"" you'll like this one too."
negative;"and ""I see it."""
positive;Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a true classic whereas Voyage Into Space is low budget nonsense.
negative;That is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and shot on video.
negative;The suspense created disappeared because of horrible acting or lack of direction from the director..
negative;Where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good...
negative;This trashy European weirdo walks up and starts talking pretentious fruitiness to the main character, sounding like he just walked out of an episode of Dark Shadows.
negative;Was he still using hooked-on-phonics and just got his letters mixed up to make these horrible sentences?, or was he trying to get the Director killed by the few people who saw this?
negative;I like Jeff Daniels, but he should stick to acting and forget writing.
negative;They also spend too much time on talking rather than fighting which can bore the viewers.
positive;Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, splendid actors both, seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in English.
positive;There won't be a lot here that horror fans haven't seen before but there's a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard-core fan.
negative;A difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart.

positive;I suggest that you see this show if you can!!
positive;2.
positive;"I haven't seen any of Jules Dassin's American films for several years but based on this I'll probably be going back and re-watching ""Brute Force"" and ""Night and the City"" quite soon.<br /><br />Jean Servais, a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world-weariness and coldness, has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films (hey, there wouldn't be a story otherwise) isn't coping well with the straight life."
negative;Chareters snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while Luther is away.
positive;AN OPERA!!
negative;I admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away, but this is by no means a creative work of art.
positive;We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past.
negative;Poor lady.
positive;Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris, her own farewell needing to be said.
positive;Wide trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, don't ya know).
negative;However, this short little story is done with style(!
positive;But Andaaz Apna Apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above.
negative;And even if this weren't true, that's not my point.
positive;And yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable.
negative;"Now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes ¬ñ a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano."
positive;One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene.
negative;The story is an endless chain of killings where nearly every character has only the purpose to deliver more carcasses.
negative;Despite a totally AWFUL premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match.
positive;In the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.
positive;This film is a must see!!
negative;), but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off.
positive;He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk.
negative;Maybe I'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to.
positive;Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis), and Morris, (Eddie Monroe).
positive;YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP and others like SPINACH FER Britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the Theatre's program at all in the true sense.
negative;Sadly, her discoveries lead her to pay the ultimate price in their revelation.
positive;See it if you haven¬¥t.
positive;I found only one problem with it.
positive;Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painfully detailed performances in this spare, stark drama.
positive;It's a horror story alright.
positive;Co-Starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his 'cadaverous spider' interpretation of 'Louis XI'.
positive;Their diction is less than perfect ... stilted and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent.
negative;"""Bambi"" was the first (and until today the only) movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars."
negative;The only thing worthwhile is Colin Firth, and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout.<br /><br />For diehard Firth fans only -- the shower scene alone is worth the $3.99 you might have to shell out, should you find it in a video cutout bin like I did.<br /><br />I'm happy for Mr. Firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over!
positive;Their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmented.<br /><br />Suzy Parker, the off-the-chart gorgeous ex-fashion model, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring stage actress, a role that, according to any biography I've ever read about her, was apparently not much of a stretch.
positive;The fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect.
positive;The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side.
positive;Laraine Day is a favorite actress of mine, someone MGM loaned out constantly because they didn't know what to do with her.
positive;Sure, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman and other superheros, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko over any of them.
negative;When the movie had ended there was hardly anything that was gained from any of the interactions, save a tiny few scenes or images that rose above the one note film.
positive;It sounds like a recipe for disaster.
positive;Complete entertainment!
negative;This would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie.
positive;Even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for Vito since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's Rose's hospital and medical bills.
negative;And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails.
negative;Amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play (I won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series).
positive;I love this dated SF if only for Gerry's wonderful model cars, planes, buildings and spaceships.
negative;If you rented it on a DVD and would want to watch the movie, despite the reviews, then play it on maximum speed your player would allow!

negative;The five crew members crash land on Mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts.
negative;On the other hand, Redneck has to be seen - you won't believe how bad it is otherwise!
positive;I only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up.
negative;The one good thing about this particular film was that I was never bored.
positive;He meets warlike miniatures, socialist giants, head-in-the-clouds (literally) philosophers, and pacifist horses who rule over Yahoos -- nearly neanderthal humanoids.
positive;By the end it's too late.
negative;That's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow, barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work.
positive;No doubt she was a very engaging writer, and she did possess an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words.
positive;However it is light entertainment, the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting.
positive;You really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents.
negative;This is, at best, only half a movie- and not the good half.
positive;Likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it, and the turtle's partner barely looks human with his big flippers.<br /><br />Animal stories and nature documentaries always anthropomorphize, but Fata Morgana has none of that.
positive;This morning was the first time I'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade.
negative;But modern viewers (in Britain, at least) can no longer take this sort of material seriously.
negative;Where have I come across that well-worn theme before?
positive;a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world.
negative;Hardly likely.
negative;The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and vest) at which they admit their love for each other.
negative;He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches.
positive;One of the two Best Films of the year.
negative;I can only think of one reason this movie was released.
positive;The first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation.
positive;The same is true here - if it had been James having the affair and doing the subsequent activities, viewers might feel differently about the story.
positive;Acting: Samuel L Jackson is entertaining in almost any role.
negative;"""Pola X"" does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of Carax's earlier work."
positive;Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he must defend himself.
positive;though i can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer-x looked like, in the manga, they did.
positive;<br /><br />A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.<br /><br />7.4/10
negative;And it doesn't make sense.
negative;At least it was a decade ago.
negative;"The best part about ""Party Camp"" is the fact that it literally has no plot."
positive;These are the people who are singled out.
negative;I guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature.
negative;Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense!
negative;No, it wasn't a flashback.
positive;Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. come off real well, but this is Bond's film to shine as he has the best lines.
positive;The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards.
positive;<br /><br />Thank you for telling this story!!
negative;*Spoiler Ends*<br /><br />The films suffers from many things, first the weak acting drags it down immensely!
positive;The real-world accident at TMI proves the film's basic premise.
negative;"Rounding out the cast is Linda Watkins(""The Parent Trap"") as the obnoxious Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief spurting out an obvious fake ""cockney"" accent."
negative;This is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex.
negative;No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour.
negative;"The latter have a lot of spots where you win even money, and fewer for higher amounts, until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks.<br /><br />But I picture the channel's wheel having about six different genres on its wheel, with two of them, appearing the most, labeled ""The Psychotic Neighbor,"" or ""The Spouse with a Hidden Past or Secret or Both."""
positive;Andersson gives us something else here.
negative;This may just be the worst movie ever produced.
positive;This movie must be exported to the rest of the world!
positive;The three women Max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations.
positive;A very recommended film if you like the genre.
positive;Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny.
positive;The show is also very funny.
positive;Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on.
positive;calls.
positive;I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion.
negative;But most of all I'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out.<br /><br />Rating: * out of ****
negative;I guess that's why it comes on a 20-pack DVD war movie collection for five bucks.<br /><br />The 70s music did not belong in this movie or any WWII movie.
negative;Cameron Mitchell as the reporter, yet to hit his stride as a male lead, which, come to think of it, he never really did.
negative;The simple, primal premise can lead to several great stories.
positive;Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States.
positive;I recently rented her first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl.
negative;Some of the worse lines I have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.You've seen this story a thousand times.
positive;Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer, and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film.
negative;Shady writing, wooden performances, and sappy direction all point that this pulpy fertilizer has far mooore bark than bite.
negative;The story kind of follows Rosemary's baby around and stuff, but in reality it is kind of a mess, it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shines through very well.
negative;BUT THE MEMORIES OF MANKIND SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE.
positive;Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase?
positive;And Rod Cameron was the only survivor.
positive;Max and Dave even put Popeye in service aboard the mythical Battleship, the U.S.S.
negative;"At this point of the movie you could have seen the ""monster"" picking his nose and it would be considered a ""twist""."
positive;Is there a planet on the far side of the sun?
positive;A still powerful story that predates the Sidney Poitier films of racial prejudice.
positive;It's often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners, who can approach the familiar with an outsider's eye.
positive;<br /><br />Alexander Knox plays the male lead, but the real lead of the film is Irene Dunne--who looks amazing for a 47 year-old lady (yes, I checked--she really was this old when she made the film).
positive;Another scene, eerily reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining,' involves Holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.<br /><br />Genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution, Victor Sj√∂str√∂m's 'K√∂rkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying Holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.
negative;So obviously I wasn't gonna pay to see it, but once it hit DVD, I thought sure, I'll watch it for free.
negative;You know that kid who teased you in high school...he's no terrorist, he's probably an accountant.)
positive;"<br /><br />The last reel of the film will still surprise audiences, as it refuses to sink into expected clich√©s, including those that tainted ""Waterfront."""
positive;However, when a hoard of blood-thirsty zombies emerge from the local graveyard {their entrance ghoulishly narrated by Vincent Price}, the situation begins to get interesting.<br /><br />It's difficult to quite put my finger on why 'Thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all music videos.
negative;This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.<br /><br />Technically the film has a lot of problems however.
negative;Only the few leads have stamina.
negative;It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy.
negative;If I wanted to watch 60's crime drama, I'd buy DVDs.
negative;In game two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss.
negative;I love Umberto Lenzi's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT COMMANDOS pretty much legitimized the Italian Euro War phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie.
positive;How will all this work out and will Ronald wise up and act like a responsible adult--these are the main themes of this pleasant little film.<br /><br />This isn't a great movie and certainly won't change your life, but it certainly is very entertaining and fun.
positive;A homemade production in the best sense, the out-of-sync dubbing and sound recording, and the granular cinematography and up-close camera setups, build an immersive atmosphere that perfectly suits Cassavetes' nuanced vision of human relationships as perpetual works in progress, marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful attempts at communication and understanding.
negative;Let me stress that this was totally unexpected, and had nothing to do with the movie... unless it's a cynical reference to love as it's portrayed in the film: a blind, selfish, predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless... but then again, I'm probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head...
negative;Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that Othello had between Cass and Desi as well as it should.
negative;He was able to get back in the armored car, and no one saw him...
positive;He is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter.
positive;And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so.
positive;Joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he is needs is a pretext to lash out, which is what the story is about.
negative;Do we really care?
negative;This is a big disappointment.
negative;It's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable.
positive;Certainly when I saw this movie at HBO, I was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing Dustin Hoffman in it.
negative;"I found myself futilely coaching my television: ""Make sure he's dead!"
positive;She has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting!
negative;"""Sean"" is played by D.J."
negative;Is it?
positive;It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen.
negative;Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world.
positive;Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to.
negative;It is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising.
positive;Korean are very traditional people, they see love very quitely.
negative;I'll have to check back on this site.
negative;<br /><br />4 / 10.
negative;And then they tell me this movie had $80 million dollar budget.
positive;A psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of Kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...<br /><br />To say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit.
negative;There just didn't seem to be any direction.
positive;I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.<br /><br />This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain.
positive;The first scene in the stairs is fantastic, but it isn't the only one, there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, the bombing of Veronika's house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed.
negative;Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder.
positive;Even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics.
negative;In the loft, a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark, bottom area of the barn house, then she gets it.
negative;Granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?)
negative;I've seen far worse in my time.<br /><br />A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure.
negative;guessing the password for an email account) AND yawning uncontrollably (thought I must have misread the 1hr 50min running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes).
negative;Everything else was in a logical order.
negative;But this movie just destroyed that.
positive;Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10.
positive;And also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents, laying there in each others arms, and her brother, all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully, even if being poisoned, fits with a dream sequence.
negative;Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only two showing some charisma.
negative;"The scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, ""Hang 'em High"", ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"") and Professor Clark(John McNamara,""War of the Colossal Beast"")."
positive;What a shame.<br /><br />Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls, and Veronica Mars... all great shows, all sadly gone before their time.<br /><br />Hear us, loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD..... please.
negative;Not that the writers helped him out any.
positive;Despite some cringe moments, this aspect didn't hinder my enjoyment of it.
negative;This flick is a waste of time.I expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting.Van Damme's acting is awful.
negative;If you're into hearing the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago in big budget movie form, chuck your money here.
positive;Really, they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation, by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke English and so we are caught up in the confusion too.
negative;This goes on for about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Then in a five-minute montage, she sneaks into an enemy base, straps herself to a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies.<br /><br />None of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.<br /><br />In the last twenty minutes, basically the chick's memories get transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of mankind.
negative;I'll miss Bankotsu... poor, poor psycho little boy.<br /><br />Cons: Outside of Shichinintai arc, the series was overall boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating.
negative;WHAT THE HELL.<br /><br />Small things were noticed too: Ulf's red hair which he gets from Astrid has been changed to brown in the movie, and Vivian works at a chocolate shop.
negative;The only thing that it's missing so far is the Jesus is GOD message.
negative;It will not make sense.<br /><br />The second act involves a woman walking in the desert.
negative;Subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia!
negative;"Add ""DE-LISH"" to my list of stupid tag words."
negative;Well -- and why not?
positive;Most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well.
negative;Too many parallels.
positive;His heart just wasn't in the performance.
negative;For this reason I couldn't wait for this movie to end.
negative;The acting was not that bad.
negative;"Monogram Studios lived on a kind of Cost Plus basis; cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while."
negative;The script is terrible.
negative;I've just wasted my time and my money on this movie.
negative;Would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet?
positive;Awesome!
negative;Translated to vortex, Uzumaki is about just that- an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange downward spiral into nothingness that has seemingly captivated a whole small town into dementia obsessed lunatics.
positive;You can pretty much figure out the rest.<br /><br />This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.
positive;The former seems to have the upper hand.
positive;If you want to know who is Am√°lia Rodrigues.
negative;He can't.
negative;3) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago.
positive;The heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and Katherine sees her sister bury her shoes - plus, something in Helen's manner makes her realize that Helen isn't telling the truth.
positive;As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clich√©e after clich√©e, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original.
positive;Samuel L. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing.
positive;It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr Team, but into skateboarding as a whole.
positive;this film is very good and i'd reecommend it to anyone.
negative;Sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long, slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose).
positive;The movie was cheesy in the best possible way.
positive;He was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers.
negative;On the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.<br /><br />I'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good.
positive;Films like this made today just don't have the same style.
negative;"Somehow, Sam's soul ""emerges"" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot."
negative;"I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that?"
negative;There was even an actual bull but it was like it was another type of animal completely!
positive;At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary.
positive;It made me laugh!!
negative;All right, let's be realistic about this.
negative;They're just not particularly likable.
negative;First she rides a taxi with a ghost (ghosts ride taxis?)
negative;This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film.
positive;9/10
negative;For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn, while in the town at large, crosses are burned, witness are intimidated and the local citizens don't seem to care¬Ö <br /><br />Some of the reviews here claim the film immoral, since surely Samuel Jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart-tugging piece of oratory by Matthew McConaughey.
negative;They didn't miss a darn thing.
negative;You kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going, what?
positive;Some may shun Coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings.
negative;a rootless music producer) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist who crosses A.J.
positive;Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak, gray kind of way, then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch.<br /><br />The cast is, without exception, above average.
negative;The movie acts like we're already supposed to know about half the characters.<br /><br />And Steve Guttenberg tries to do manic, a-la-Robin Williams comedy in this movie.
positive;This was one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for us to purchase.
positive;9/10.
negative;I don't know.. it was like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once tasted great.
negative;"My brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has great taste in movies; from the moment he told me the title I looked at him like he was crazy."
negative;I wish that the production company could give back my money.
negative;Alas, 45 minutes in, I realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library, doing nothing.
positive;Rising Damp would, at first, appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit.
positive;Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her.
negative;I'm afraid it isn't.
negative;As an example, a whole 20 minutes, of the 80 minute film, is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's SciFi to 2001.
negative;"The ""cool cars"" and ""good message"" don't do jack to make this movie good."
negative;Zero passion.<br /><br />Even the final scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable.
positive;Seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what I've just witness.
negative;"On the title screen it says ""100 Passengers... 3,000 Venemous Vipers!"""
positive;Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his characters to succeed, in whatever he does.
positive;The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career.
negative;the 70s?
negative;Independence Day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball.
negative;There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (plays Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performances that are okay.
positive;You couldn't look better Sha-Shawn
positive;i miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips into it and out of the American pattern).
positive;It's a well-crafted show in that regard.
positive;I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless.
negative;The actor playing JPII was very rigid, there was no personality there.
negative;This film has a huge mumber of scenes.
positive;He's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes.
negative;Like Herzog, he chooses not a story but submits a report ¬ñ and a left-wing political propaganda report at that!
positive;That's because it paired John AND Lionel Barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I expected sparks and magic but instead only caught glimpses of it here and there.
positive;I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).
negative;His Brigham City was quite good.
negative;"Asks newbie pilot Robert Downey, Jr., ""When you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate?"""
negative;Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?
positive;Directed by Jesse Cowell and animated by Erica Langworthy, starring the beautiful Marissa Parness, with music by Nico Audy-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathearn, Matt Sisco, and Selcuk Bor.
positive;Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthwhile film and deserves attention.
negative;The direction was trying to be way too creative with what it was working with, and the flashback sequences were used merely as a shock effect.<br /><br />After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and review the film and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving.
negative;Just laugh at it.
negative;Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt, and Corey Feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something I'd love to try sometime.
negative;I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, on the big screen.
positive;On the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sj√∂str√∂m, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the New Year.
positive;"This enables the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston; yep, she could be a colonel's wife."
negative;I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film.
negative;I found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest, but the other 11 odd shorts really didn't pique my interest or make me think of anything at all.
positive;Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable.
negative;Well.....I don't buy it Mr.
negative;mystery.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong!
negative;The hero is Lee Shao Hwa who I have never heard of before or any of the other actors.
negative;The artistry of that film far overpowers the gore, and this is not seen once in Surveillance.
positive;It really wasn't.
negative;And have the black woman be from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you've got Black Mama, White Mama.<br /><br />In those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit.
negative;This was pathetic.
positive;Then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.<br /><br />The main failing here is in the performances people give.
negative;Which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie.
negative;"I told her I practice myself a lot..."" Now THIS is a movie!<br /><br />Also, according to similar movie ""Executive Decision"" where lazy eyed Steven Segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance, 747's have massive attics up top."
positive;There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite.
negative;There's a confusing bit at the end(well, more confusing than usual, anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this, but it makes no sense whatsoever.
positive;"If you want something ""different"", look no further."
negative;The japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the Americans before Corrigador fell.
negative;Piranha, Piranha certainly qualifies for that former badge, and is pretty damn close to the second.
positive;However, Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank.
positive;Deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window.
positive;- that was only a matter of interest to Page.
negative;Sure, the effects are laughable, the story confused, but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun.
negative;But no, VH1 is cheap.
positive;And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay-subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Bell!
negative;Go see a real Japanese film.
positive;Indeed, it is always tough to make a movie from a comics and the first episode of the adventures of the French two greatest heroes was good but not fantastic.
positive;this movie stands atop the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great Chris Farley.
positive;Aaron: No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!<br /><br />The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks, and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant!
positive;"Like the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to just label this a ""blaxsploitation film""."
positive;Samojlova does a magnificent job, and her character transformation will break your heart.
positive;Even a grandmother and school teacher (me) can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality (well, reality, film-wise).
positive;Then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about.<br /><br />The editing is the real star of the film.
negative;The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film.
negative;But a good story don't have to be expensive.
positive;I don't think a better portrayal could have been done.
negative;We then get a cheap scare, followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend.
negative;I look forward to the show's, and the network's, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.
negative;I was not disappointed in this undertaking, but had I been watching this one in a serious mood, I would have been irate.
negative;But the rest was real bad.
negative;I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out.
negative;But in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film, and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops.
positive;Both movies re-use gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time.
positive;They delivered.
negative;One dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.
positive;Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery.
negative;Every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor.
positive;Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia.
negative;That's right.
negative;Set the story on some Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived.
positive;When you see this part you will think it's a gag.
negative;It comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers.
positive;On one New Year's Eve several years ago, George has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing Death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased.
positive;one of the true great actors of our time, and one of the true great comedy's of all time.
positive;"The second episode of the new ""Lost"" gives you just what its fans were lacking - a fair amount of riveting action."
negative;But apart from that, it's just not very interesting.
positive;"More ""Quentin-ish"" than most films try to be."
negative;The Final Girl: She has just broken up for her boyfriend.
positive;What I am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly, but then they focus in on it to make it strong.<br /><br />And it is very strong, but also the plot sequencing is great.
positive;<br /><br />The film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context.
negative;Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed.
positive;"Too bad it all turns out to be a dream, which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short (almost a feature film at 46 minutes).<br /><br />There are inventive gags galore including Charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent from home, then using the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy; Charlie disguising himself as a tree--one of his best sketches ever--and Charlie pretending to beat up his friend who has become a POW, then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight.<br /><br />One amazing feature is how much Charlie, when he is behind enemy lines dressed as a German, resembles Hitler over ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs rose to dominate German politics."
positive;Joel McCrea is in this film also, but has a rather colorless part as Andrea Leeds boyfriend.
negative;I saw this one on Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and I do not have to much to say either.
positive;"One more thing, too-- what, exactly, is so bad about Judge Turpin's performance of ""Johanna"" that it is banned from the American theatre, but not the cannibal anthem ""A Little Priest""?<br /><br />Otherwise, this is an excellent production."
positive;It is a most touching work of art, weaving the serious, serene, and lighter sides of life for this family.
positive;So, Lionel spends much of the movie following John--hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief.<br /><br />Although I liked the film, I really think I had higher expectations for it and thought it might be better than just a very good time-passer.
negative;No matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue they can't leave it the hell alone.
negative;Even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake Pam Grier and Margaret Markov for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.
negative;Of course none of that matters, because at first everyone always thinks that one's crazy.
negative;Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, Deodato blew it away with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi fired back with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato blew him (and everyone else) away with the superior CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi fired a last parting salvo with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is about as realistic as that Krazy Glu commercial where the guy superglues his hardhat to a girder and hangs in midair.<br /><br />This film is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss with everything holy than FEROX, which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to upstage CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.
positive;This film makes viewers think hard.<br /><br />We need films like this to give us a boost.
positive;So it's up to Taylor (who is NOT known for his manly roles--especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible AND the inside man.<br /><br />However, there are two serious complications.
positive;The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him.
positive;With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East, and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return.<br /><br />Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war.
positive;Or, even worse, watch the Italian war movies.
positive;Underling this is a humorously wicked black streak.
positive;I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did.
positive;<br /><br />Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue.
positive;I think it must have been the title that put me off.
positive;Yes, Mickey makes his debut here, in this cheery tale of life on board a steamboat.
positive;I think I am some kind of Road Runner fan.
positive;And isn't this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie?
positive;Things spiral rapidly out of hand before degenerating completely.
negative;"Yes, it was an awful movie, but there was a song near the beginning of the movie, I think, called ""I got a Woody"" or something to that effect."
positive;If you can turn your brain off, and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick.
positive;No, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes.
negative;In the book, he wants nothing to do with VIVAN after she turns for him.
positive;"The sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a ""grinding head-on collision"" before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda), doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house (or is that ""aquarium?"")"
positive;It's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over.
negative;"The title itself is only marginally appropriate: ""Succubare"" is the Latin verb meaning ""to lie beneath"", and it's the root of the word Succubus, a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep."
negative;"I remember another movie on a similar subject, ""The Rapture,"" starring Mimi Rogers, that was much better and professionally done."
positive;It was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film lacked with an ridicilous ending.<br /><br /> Overall, a exellent comedy, full of laughs, and lots of fake green vomit.
negative;Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil.
negative;After elevating this, Miles has since appeared in the Hollywood movie 'V for Vendetta', and the 2001 star studded film 'The Affair of the Necklace', alongside Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce.
positive;Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.<br /><br />To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story.
positive;Isabella and her son wait for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest.
negative;($1.99 on Amazon, and I had it rush delivered!
negative;Get the idea?<br /><br />MISSED OPPORTUNITIES The movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed.
negative;A jaw-dropping, insanely terrible movie.
negative;"Down Buenos Aires way, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age; one may think film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it's modern-day 1942."
negative;I have about a 20 minutes to go.
positive;"What strikes you about the ""encounter"" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out."
negative;"They even stole the whole infra-red vision P.O.V from the creature in ""Predator"", which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective."
positive;The settings, the lighting, the props... all add to the mood for love between the main characters.
negative;"Especially since this is a Television Show where the audience cannot read your mind.<br /><br />""Paranormal State"" is all Turn and no Prestige."
negative;The movie is based upon a really good and very topical idea but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard Hollywood 'disaster movie' formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production.<br /><br />An unusually high tide and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a record high storm surge that overwhelms London and floods most of the Thames Valley.
positive;Maybe we would go back to the real movies.
negative;The juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring.<br /><br />As for the acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy.
negative;I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me.
positive;Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like Tim Robbins character.
negative;And the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either.<br /><br />**1/2 Two and a half Out of Five Stars (Average.)
positive;I do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie!
positive;it was well done.
positive;It's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one.<br /><br />Last but in no way the least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema.
positive;He rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him, has never married, rarely socializes, just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother.
negative;All over the place, no timing.<br /><br />The ending is probably the worse I have seen in quite some time.
negative;The kind that changes the main plot piece in one way, this time, the K-9 plays football instead of basketball.
positive;Loved this movie!!
positive;The (relatively) happy girl gave good comic relief, a nice respite from the continual (but understandable) ragging on the dude who left them in a lurch.
positive;I'm not very sure.<br /><br />A thought-provoking film on the whole and well worth watching.
positive;"He'd once had a friend name George, ""a merry fellow"" who was ""smarter than the rest of us."""
positive;If you want to watch lonesome d. with Robert Duvall and tommy L. J. then watch the original.
positive;Rupert Everett does some of his finest work in Unconditional as Dirk.
positive;Yet they stick it out, for what?
negative;I wonder if one guy on the credits = one drawing!
negative;Josh's mother is dating once again.
positive;Even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies.<br /><br />My favourite episodes are the first three - these set the high standard that was to continue.
positive;The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.<br /><br />Good acting by all the actors especially Nandita Das amidst criticism from the Indian public
negative;They should of just kill off all of them.
negative;When I saw this at my local video store I thought my dream had come true.
negative;"Try not to laugh as you watch the Tabonga toss fake natives down hills & into quicksand, dodge spears, and lumber slowly about the ""island""."
positive;I would love to see this movie again.
positive;Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.<br /><br />Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic.
positive;"Fassbinder's ""The Merchant of the Four Seasons""."
positive;The idea is to make the Jackal look like a turncoat to the Russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin.
negative;If that guy didn't step on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway!
positive;In fact, the actress playing Johanna is not only off-tempo to a dismal degree, but also slightly off-key.
positive;Still they looked great in them so who's complaining?
negative;"And then the ""big"" twist comes (was this the third or fourth?)"
positive;It has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow.
positive;(thus the 8/10 rating)
positive;"We wondered, leaving the theatre, whether Roxane's ""beard"" was a wig."
positive;OK, ten...
positive;"The town Xi'an is pronounced ""See-an"" , never ""Zai-an""- surely the American voice-over speakers could have got that right !"
positive;The actors did a good job plus the make-up crews.
negative;If 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors, this is pretty much the result I would expect.<br /><br />I also think some of the scenes were spliced out of order - things don't always seem to progress in order.
negative;I am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release.
positive;An educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society.
positive;The film begins with one of the goofiest scenes I can remember in a film.
negative;Where's the suspence?
positive;But I don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom.
positive;It's enough for Ann that Maggie knows.
negative;Plain and simple.
negative;We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic.
negative;Camera angles just weren't that good, especially regarding Carrie's face.
positive;I was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not?
positive;Soon Tommy and Brick are chasing after an attractive blonde at an officer's dance, Tommy insults the Captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the Captain's daughter.
negative;man with pitch black skin and patches of fur here and there.
positive;Cinema like this is sorely missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the British have the gumption to produce it.
positive;Also check out the Jim Henson Hour if you can get your hands on it.
negative;A married couple has more then just each other.
negative;If you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.<br /><br />What was the purpose of this movie?
positive;Also, more of the key political players on both sides should have been used, though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time.
negative;Having been a Godzilla fan for many years, Gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of Toho's #1 kaiju star.
positive;Absolutely a joy and must-see film... even if one's not an old hippie!!
negative;Keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out.
negative;I have considered burning my copy but I have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they SHOULD HAVE read before making this movie!!
positive;A thinking person's sexual thriller.
positive;Furtive meetings in underground car parks, code-breaking, stolen missile plans, that kind of thing.
positive;Then the virulent anti-semitism on that street catches him, despite his credentials as a Presbyterian WASP.
negative;Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend.
negative;The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie.<br /><br />I borrowed this one with an open mind, i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie.<br /><br />Boy was i wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary, the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode, as i already would guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.<br /><br />Overall avoid this crappy movie.<br /><br />Save some money.
negative;He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into.<br /><br />What could have been an alright thriller, turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie, which was sad.
negative;"Definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it.<br /><br />First segment is called ""Showdown""."
positive;I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs.
negative;Guess which category SOLO falls into.
positive;First, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is Stanwyck.
negative;And the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep.
positive;It's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do.
positive;Bruce Willis gives his always-outstanding comedic-romantic acting power to this message-movie and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are.
negative;<br /><br />Standouts were Peta Wilson, who wasted time studying with a Dominatrix for the part.
positive;This movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed, on Australia's Special Broadcasting Service.
negative;This tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de-evolution is not well known from the theatrical run (did it have one?)
negative;It's of the same banal ilk and therefore equally devoid of intelligence.
positive;It was very authentic in how they displayed the components dealing with this movie which includes the guns, horses, and clothing.
positive;Please to whom it my concern, please make this movie available so all can have this historical experience.
negative;pulled it off, because it was meant to resemble old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink....it's sad.
negative;"The title of said game is ""Backwater,"" but upon looking for information on it I came up with absolutely nothing.<br /><br />And so we begin the movie..."
positive;His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him.
positive;What makes this film different are mainly its acting & style.
negative;One of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic T*ts, which would have been okay if I hadn't had to watch them bob around whenever she waddled on the screen.<br /><br />The lowest I can give is one, & it probably deserves that for having Heather Thomas in it, as she was certainly sexy & shapely, though her acting was as bad as everyone else.
negative;Trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry.
positive;It also focuses on the history of skateboarding.
positive;!..Bottom line, see this movie!!
positive;(Yes, Octopussy made more money.)
negative;I saw this video at a friends house, and it was the lamest thing i have seen ever.
positive;"hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing!The main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene ""Prometheus"",but there are lots of sub-plots,like the disappearing of Thomas and a crazy guy looking for Monsieur Warok....what's the meaning of all this??"
negative;I couldn't stand the scenes with her - i.e.
positive;The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz's films.
negative;Or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch.
positive;Raima Sen gave her first great performance that I have seen.
negative;A solid 3.0.
negative;He doesn't want to share quarters with the 'negros'.
negative;The resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become obscure.
negative;theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda.
negative;Whatever.<br /><br />It makes zero sense.
negative;It's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film.
positive;this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy.
positive;!<br /><br />The aggregate catastrophe of World War II has mirrored most Americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well!
positive;The filming is worthy of this film stock.<br /><br />3.
negative;Even the always dependable Henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance.
positive;It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed.
negative;This isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer.<br /><br />In the end, it's eminently clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated, and the repeated comments about IBM's stock rising 15% the day that Deep Blue won suggest the idea that IBM cheated to pump its stock price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron).
negative;Solomon Kane looks like it is based on the video game Dark Watch, and it sounds like it is based on the video game Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately neither is true.
positive;Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life.
negative;But if this was a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism.
negative;NO!
positive;they did some tweaking to some story lines from the manga, but it all turned out pretty well.
positive;Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart.
positive;At the movie's conclusion, Danglard, having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes, approaches a new attraction watching the incredible (and believe me, it IS incredible) performance of the cancan.
positive;the last bus ride and the final kiss)<br /><br />But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories?
positive;Now it's a standoff--Slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back, the lady is dead.
negative;Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan?
positive;I can't recall any film with McKinley or Dewey in it as a character, though I do remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a couple other films.
positive;<br /><br />Another thing about the Holocaust that I kind of disagree with the documentary...is that I don't believe it was just a matter of discrimination...but rather something deeper and more profound, and that was just an act of pure evil.
positive;"The last 45 minutes are as dream-like as what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams.<br /><br />Lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet."
negative;Pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem.
positive;Oscar-caliber acting, always.<br /><br />Sapsorrow - Everybody loves 'The Soldier and Death,' but something about 'Sapsorrow' pushes it an iota higher in my favor.
positive;Everyone tries to cover it up except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the film.
positive;They are the lowest forms of scum, but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their stories.<br /><br />The violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible, but the show isn't about the violence like some people might believe.
positive;That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera?
positive;"Aside from a select few lines of dialogue (""we have to stop it!"""
negative;The movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending.
negative;And of not being.<br /><br />- I think the worst fault, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth.
negative;"@#$ is gunna be big, yo!"""
positive;Sir Alec Guinness makes a special appearance, too.
negative;).<br /><br />I found the movie offensive, not as an Argentinian, but as a watcher.
negative;But, can YOU say Moby Dick?<br /><br />There are so many retarded scenes in this movie.
positive;A big bravo to all involved.
positive;The Brothers Fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first Peacetime Draft in United States History.
negative;"If this is what's best in the Finnish cinema at the moment, I'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting ""culture"" have gone to waste here in a horrible way."
positive;"He ""goes through the motions,"" but we learn precious little about the man within."
negative;Sorry.
negative;"And more than that, I think he was forced to pattern his show as the ""Hispanic/Latino/Spanish"" version of the Dave Chappelle show."
negative;And incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the Japanese right to him.
negative;This is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident.<br /><br />The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent.
negative;Just a recommendation.<br /><br />So give it a chance, and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if I had my hand in it...
negative;This movie was pure trash.
negative;Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie.
negative;Ormond and Pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers, I thought... which gave the film's makers far too much credit.
negative;I was quite pleasantly surprised: it certainly wasn't a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which I looked forward to finding the solution to.
positive;Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions!
negative;Actually though, I did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable, over-the-top and incredible.<br /><br />Who does this crap?
positive;This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.<br /><br />Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A.
positive;"Still interesting today although it does have an ""old movie"" look to it."
negative;Awful!
negative;I guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression.
negative;"After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the contrarian French egghead, dedicated ""A Bout de Souffl√©"" to Monogram, so they can't have been all that bad."
positive;However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals.
negative;"Oh yeah the saw 2 tag line sounds real promising: ""Oh yes, there will be blood."""
positive;You should be able to sense the power and rawness Zep had in their early days.
negative;The children survive, so it's obvious they are going to let Jill survive.
negative;"Seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.<br /><br />Fans of ""Beat"" Takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.<br /><br />2/10"
positive;I highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.
positive;You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey.
negative;The loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well-captured in images such as that wherein 'Marilyn Monroe' (a gorgeous Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a Seven Year Itch pose in the middle of a forest, or when 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake.<br /><br />As it is, moments like these, and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen Michael Jackson songs crawl across the scene, are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be.<br /><br />(For those who see it, I lost all faith during the egg-singing scene, late on.
positive;Nothing else but pure evil.<br /><br />Excellent documentary of Anne Frank and of the Holocaust that should be watched.
positive;When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first.
negative;<br /><br />Bottom line: Passport to Paris is one of the worst movies ever made.
negative;echoed through the theater, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer.
negative;I know I wouldn`t , and seeing as you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $25,000 dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques ?
positive;You wonder what will happen next, while at the same time, feeling you saw something happen.<br /><br />Nice score, too.
positive;This is an excellent documentary about Am√°lia Rodrigues.
positive;In some scenes, entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered - while the scene itself was untouched.
positive;To Jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business.
positive;Nevertheless, it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination.
positive;I no more than finished the movie and began calling my friends to recommend it.
negative;The movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane.
negative;This movie was so predictable and poorly acted.
positive;Personally the definitive interpretation of the Robin Hood legend.
positive;The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster ¬ñ Oh My God!
positive;In one, an aimless deserter, Pike, having lost his trading partner, steals a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, so-called because of its grace and speed.
negative;It also figures that the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid Trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny Trekkie brain.
negative;"Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in cow-ntless European B-films, usually as Rosabla Neri, including ""Hercules Against the Moon Men"", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress."
negative;Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity.
positive;Secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he sort of knows it, whereas I've always found that James Bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse.
positive;What gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cell/FBI uses and the authentic shots in europe, the US and the middle east, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately The cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly-written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns.
positive;It's a realistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore is always making references.
positive;I have Never forgot this movie.
positive;This is a Hollywood film.
positive;The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts.
negative;"Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, ""No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed."""
negative;(Come to think of it, I give that piece of cinematography 9 stars.
positive;"right the hospital scene with Holly and Shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with Piper On A gurney looking very badly injured, the docs race her into a resuscitation room & they move her from the gurney onto a bed and Prue Holds Her Hand from that point on it is obvious that Piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing, as she turns to beg of Prue to not leave her side she gaps ""don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest & the monitor shows a clear flat line & the nurses go into full out trauma mode & bring in a defibrillator Prue Steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls"
negative;The story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques, which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them.
negative;"In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.<br /><br />Kelly dances around his film's ""message"", trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is."
positive;Of course, James then isn't so eager to rush to the police.
negative;Being a long-time fan of Japanese film, I expected more than this.
negative;I really tried to tap into the (so called) silly & surreal humor that this film sets out to be.
positive;He is the hero, the most charming, disarming rickshaw driver you will ever encounter- he's magical.
negative;And Arthur Franz as the pipe-smoking head scientist, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey.
positive;"Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he ""feels"" like a real person, rather than a hollywood ""all american hero""."
positive;The film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from TV shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line.
positive;"Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang."
positive;The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences.
positive;She did a simply amazing job.<br /><br />Natalie Portman also did a great job.
negative;No redeeming features at all.
negative;Silly crap.
negative;Don't waste your time, or money.
positive;I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats.
negative;"It is way below limits be called ""professional""."
positive;One of the most famous of all movie serials!
positive;I've got nothing too much to comment on this one due to its brevity.<br /><br />HUMAN LARVAE is one of the films lynchpins and it is a totally unflinching portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister.
positive;And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination, although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn't very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on, probably about five times longer than it was worth.
positive;Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies.
positive;This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations.
positive;Female moviegoers were not shortchanged: Fox's handsomest young contract player, Jeffrey Hunter, is as photogenic as Ms. Paget, while Michael Rennie lurks around in the background, stirring up evil doings in the land of the pyramids.
positive;The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.
positive;There are also those, who, however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film, think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence.
positive;"As I watching this based-on-a-real-life story, I was thinking, ""nobody is this nice, this tolerant."""
positive;Some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant, from the pencil is the rear-end, to the rubber sex-pants, as well was the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye.
negative;Makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br />Two stars.
negative;Neither did I.<br /><br />It's bad (it was MST'd, after all) and also a Golan-Globus production but after all is said and done, Ireland just basically looks lost, like she's trying to find where the photographers are so she can do a photo shoot instead.<br /><br />And I don't blame her.<br /><br />One star.
negative;Will children enjoy this movie?
positive;It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas.
negative;As he's made to runs into the Reynolds' house, under her control, as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal.
positive;Madison walks a careful balancing act as Riordan, handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in `Fort Apache' Madison does a more skillful job at it.<br /><br />This movie has a `Silverado' type camaraderie.
negative;It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.<br /><br />So, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity?
positive;Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.<br /><br />Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed.
positive;Fact.)
negative;How wrong I was.<br /><br />For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear.
negative;Well, definitely, Asterix is not made to move!
positive;It has that home-made, gritty quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park would later have.
positive;"In the middle of all of this insanity are Tromeo and Juliet, literature's most famous ""star crossed"" lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.<br /><br />The film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original, or close to original, lines."
positive;And SO incredibly real.
positive;Also it's far too short--I didn't believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second.
negative;The whole story was bad.
positive;Thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as Nutbourne Rail Station, great fun 8/10.
positive;"This is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike ""Honey..."" and has more effects than the spectacular ""MuppetVision"""
positive;It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.<br /><br />This is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /><br />1.
negative;The soundtrack sucked.
negative;"I think those were on par with the ""Matrix"" movies and ""Transformers"" bravo you guys!"
negative;"I kept wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those ""lovely"" comments."
positive;Its a great movie.
negative;Editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess?
positive;So it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting.
negative;This movie doesn't just have a few plot holes, it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain!
positive;As the movie is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few creepy moments.<br /><br />This is a cool flick but don't expect anything marvelous.
negative;But, don't mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi.
negative;moments but the tension builds, the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely.
positive;The film ¬ñ written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller ¬ñ is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences.
negative;Laura Gemser is in it along with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but that is the only connection to Emanuelle.
negative;I've seen it before.<br /><br />If you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no over repetitiveness, this is not for you then.
positive;Simply great!
negative;But I had to turn my face away when they kissed.
positive;Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good.
negative;Yaaayyyy!!!!
positive;Yet she prays a lot, as does her family.
negative;"I wanted something that was mindless and that I could just sit back and say, ""what the hell were they thinking?"""
negative;WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms?
positive;It's not near as bad as The Shawshank Redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene were Keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ears if you are little.
negative;No sense of timing, nothing inspired.
positive;I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the films of John Waters, since I was way too young to watch them.
positive;There are several shots of Jim at home, lonely and thinking of Leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet.
positive;You may recognize his voice, as he also furnished the voice of Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book, and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood.
negative;Director/screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage.
negative;She seemed to have no transportation or companions with her.
positive;Nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read Faulkner's book and saw his movie while in college in Alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years.
positive;I mean, don't get me wrong, I liked the film.
positive;The story line is typical, but full of jocular surprises, especially concerning the unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
positive;Dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over-indulgent society.
negative;Hmm, I wonder who the police's main suspect will be?
negative;Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day.
negative;A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast.
positive;"Sure it's fairly straightforward, but the concept of ""swapping murders"" is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and age, which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while."
positive;The delicate Marina Zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the American mute girl Billy.
negative;It's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.<br /><br />Carols Mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy.
positive;Even simple sound effects were added/omitted from each version - having a major impact on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene.
positive;I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets.<br /><br />The end of the film is it's strongest part.
negative;since there's no real plot and the script is so crappy, you cant expect any real character development, or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, they simply add some disconnected dramatic music, which signals you that something very dramatic is going on , instead of actually creating something dramatic..<br /><br />the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie, and a complete waste of time which somehow got an incredibly high score for its level, probably because of the cast - and this is exactly what the producers where counting on.
positive;The events of the film are based on a true story.<br /><br />Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations.
negative;Time to smash!<br /><br />Anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies, because it has pretty decent FX for 1957.
negative;Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out.
positive;<br /><br />United Artists spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES.
negative;There might be some laughs in it that escaped me.
negative;It's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre.
positive;Things was fine for a while.
negative;After watching it i walk out like, what happened?
positive;When one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust.
positive;Seven months since a revelatory viewing of Faces, I finally found a rentable DVD copy of Cassavetes' first feature.
positive;i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it.
negative;"Anycow, because his doughy, vacant wife, Korey, played amateurishly by Suzanne Ridgeway(""Love's A-Poppin'""), helps set him up, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all of the elders."
positive;But most of all, it showed the vitality, since muted by the inroads of Giuliani, Disney and tourism.<br /><br />What I wouldn't give to be young again.
negative;"The movie could've saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to reprimand or ""redeem"" idiot characters who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes)."
positive;"in his descriptions of CAA, platinum card lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown he never took, and free trips to Nicaragua, financed by Columbia pictures.<br /><br />It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.<br /><br />This monologue is not just about ""The Killing Fields"", or ""Swimming to Cambodia""; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them."
positive;This movie packs a punch.
negative;But then, they paid for Love Actually.
negative;This is √ºber-trash, I'm talking 'Manos'-level crap, meaningless, unwatchable, not-even-so-bad-it's-good, cinematic bile of the highest order.<br /><br />Lance Henriksen IS Harlan Knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality.
positive;While you don't see anything graphic, this cruelty and the convincing acting of both Crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene.
negative;My mom brought me this movie on a DVD.
positive;"His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem."
negative;The best thing you can say about the director/actor/egotist is that he's got great taste in music.
positive;The PR flack (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant, built by Westinghouse.
positive;We don't yet know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time.
positive;Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status as fiction?
negative;I must say, when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was well worth a view.
negative;What's so unique about him?
positive;The NAACP has voiced no contest for race issues, and let us not forget Amos N Andy was a huge hit in the 50's as a TV series.
negative;I'm told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to America (go figure!
negative;Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy.
positive;All lies!
positive;"But after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away ""on business""/""taking care of a sick mother""), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.<br /><br />Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among ""romantic melodramas,"" in the best sense of that term."
positive;His past, we come to learn, is one of chaos and conflict.
positive;"It's a thrill to watch people do what they love-- and I'm not even peripherally talking about ""meat pies with a twist""."
negative;A low point for all involved except perhaps Bologna, who must sit up nights trying to figure out which bomb was THE bomb that destroyed his career.
negative;It does have a few known names in it (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio).
positive;The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears by the end along with most of the audience.
negative;So simple, that the movie is not evolving until the end.
negative;They were admittedly inferior wlthout question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure .
positive;It was a complete and utter joy to watch.
negative;This film does not entertain.
positive;Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer?
negative;The studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-Year-Old Virgin, complete with several of Carell's past co-stars, a reference to the flick on a theater marquee, and another musical closing credits sequence.
positive;"the best word to describe it is ""genius""!"
negative;Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.<br /><br />Through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of clich√©, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing.
positive;The main conflict between the two is that, while Antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it, Karina wants to see the world and resents the place.
negative;The Family Way, Spring and Port Wine, Get Carter, The long Good Friday, Trainspotting....Don't get me wrong I like a bit of escapist hokum.
negative;At any rate, he's in need of a haircut, badly, distractingly badly.
positive;The film consists of 57 vignettes shot mostly by a still camera, and it was the careful design of each of these scenes which required much time.
positive;I rented this movie, but I wasn't too sure what to expect of it.
positive;"One can't help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well, especially the concept of ""darkness in humanity's heart"", demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death."
negative;"The worst sin ""Fuckland"" committed was to express such a statement about its own director.<br /><br />The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie."
negative;The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons.
negative;The misogyny of this film is painful as well.
negative;Of the two episodes I watched each revolved around violent, nasty hauntings tied to violent, nasty deaths.
negative;"It truly deserves to be on the IMDb list of the 100 worst of all time, and has never left the top 3 on my personal ""worst"" list."
negative;Tom Everret Scott's performance is amatuerish at best, and he and Julie Delpy, who plays his love interest, don't seem to have any chemistry together at all.
positive;15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata.
negative;None of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale.<br /><br />Given the choice I'd take a pass.
negative;You'd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover-art of the box displays, but instead, you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any Halloween display counter.
negative;"Like ""The Blair Witch Project"" before it, ""Hatchet"" has garnered its own fair share of publicity from the bottom-on-up (as an avid reader of Fangoria Magazine, the full-page ads are hard to miss); even after its middling theatrical run, the film is bound to subsist solely on the hype surrounding it, and will probably turn into a cult item at some point."
positive;concludes Holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.<br /><br />As fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight.
negative;This is not a good film.
negative;Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing - comedically or otherwise.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon.
negative;The direction, dialogue, and visual effects are just horrible.
negative;NOOO!
positive;I am sure it is great also.
negative;It's child abuse.
negative;Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a Smurf.<br /><br />And the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite.
negative;I stopped caring.
positive;A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.
negative;Initially I only wanted to see it because I'm an out and out Neil Pearson fan (Patrick, boyfriend of Isobel, the lead).
negative;A mild-mannered NY lawyer (George Segal) is slowly going crazy.
positive;I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV.
positive;Almost all of the subplots (particularly, the reckless Colonel) have been done better elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity.
negative;Three absolutely pointless segments, all featuring the director playing himself -- and he's not that interesting.
negative;But his mother keeps scaring her away.
negative;Critics are falling over themselves within the Weinstein's Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based.
positive;If you're an intellectual looking for something to p**s away your evening on, I highly suggest this film for satisfaction.
negative;Yep, see, an EVP, right?
negative;Amelia getting her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a promotion at his job at the Giger & Greengrass law-firm over the more deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica has her cast a spell on Hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself.<br /><br />Larry finding out about Erica's attempt on his best friend Larry's life has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony to her death.
negative;The fact that Ron Hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding.
negative;Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as the photographer, but it is Me Me Lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great.
positive;Alone, I'd say the Korean version is a nice love story that I'd watch once in awhile.
positive;First of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death.
negative;"between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers singing corny(stupid) songs like ""Ride little cowboy"" being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious."
negative;Milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick Mikey, if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline!But if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing.
positive;All good movies, but the rest of the top-grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non-sensical plots and lots of eye candy.
negative;It was a non-moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film The 3 main actors are good, and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't.
positive;And a great musical score.
positive;So, as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so.
negative;Richard Kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal, HUMAN conversation.
positive;This is the best 3-D experience Disney has at their themeparks.
negative;He becomes a beast and begins to kill even his own comrades.
negative;Perhaps the costume department was going for gritty, but all they got was dirty and dingy.<br /><br />Since the movie was completely true to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more.
positive;The best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it.
negative;I recorded it as it came on HBO this past weekend and when I saw this I literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that I was not seeing things!
positive;Is that Flea?
positive;<br /><br />A quick breakdown.
negative;I've had to wait for that bridge to go down many times, almost all of them on the bus.
negative;I've been a classic horror fan my entire life.
negative;"Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical cash-grabber (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan.<br /><br />The most extreme, confronting genre pics, to paraphrase a character in VIDEODROME, ""have a philosophy""; that is what makes them dangerous.<br /><br />ISLAND OF DEATH's philosophy is to throw many ""shocking"" elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly."
positive;Yet, the subject it deals with, namely, the misery of the humankind in a selfish world, reaches far beyond this hemisphere.
negative;It seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care.
negative;The characters are annoying, immature, and flaky....Madison being the most annoying of all.
negative;After reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie I decided to rent it despite some suspicions of TV movies.
negative;"The Kite Runner began as one of those ""important"" films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly descended into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish proportions.<br /><br />I've never read the book, and never felt the need because I honestly don't care."
negative;Ah, Andy Milligan.
positive;The performances by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turns by Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderers.<br /><br />This riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller.
positive;Early days I know, but Lane acts her socks off here.
positive;Also, the king was probably one of the creepiest character's I've seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, weird eyes (usually crossed), and a soft but scary voice.
positive;Editing seems non-existent and hence effective.
negative;Whoever employs this Sylvestra Le Touzel lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life.
negative;The acting is horrible, the pacing is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is laughably bad.
negative;"Oh, and btw: I don't believe that any young actress listens to classical music; was Jarmusch trying to be surreal by making Chloe listen to that kind of music?"
negative;<br /><br />The monster's apparent intent is to rebuild its race using human beings as food and giant wombs.
positive;There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen straight off Apocalypse Now co-starred with the actor he replaced on Coppola's film, Harvey Keitel.
positive;and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance.
positive;The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era.
negative;"Director von Theurmer previously helmed a variety of grade Z Euro-trash, including ""Jungle Warriors"", ""Island of the Dead""(as Mel Wells), and ""The Crucified Girls of San Ramon""."
negative;"The phrase ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but truth isn't always."
negative;Right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed.
positive;By the end of the film, I was left wishing that I'd had the opportunity to meet Dieter before his passing.<br /><br />On a technical note, the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful.
negative;Mena Suvari was delightfully repellent.
negative;All of the characters were two-dimensional.
positive;Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events.
negative;""", or ""Just kill him already!"""
positive;Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) rival parts of Fantasia.
positive;And do you recognize Peter Hackes from real life Broadcast News?
positive;Finally, someone spoke up and remembered loaning it to the film crew in Georgetown!
positive;It all flowed well.
positive;So satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed.
positive;He imagines he has common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the Warren Commission, blamed Horrigan-unfairly, Leary believes-for the assassination of President Kennedy.
negative;But director Umberto Lenzi, usually acknowledged as a Deodato rip-off, directed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972.
positive;You'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different.
negative;"(I should know, that's what I did) If you loved ""Tales from the Crypt"", you'll love ""Two-fisted tales"" too because basically it's all the same."
negative;"The ""acting"" is god awful and the plot non-existent.<br /><br />Here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.<br /><br />1) A posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite."
positive;I forgive him.
negative;Both have their different agendas, but like Sid and Tony they can't quite agree on whose agenda comes first.
positive;He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain.
positive;I don't have kids, but the kids I babysit, (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features on the DVD.
positive;Its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time.
negative;There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny.
negative;<br /><br />But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under.
positive;Mna i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick.
positive;And Angela Lansbury's slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating.
positive;But it doesn't matter.
negative;I'm not sure.
negative;Their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend.
positive;It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids.
positive;I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III.
negative;But is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of Walt Disney?
positive;David Strickland was a terrific actor.
positive;It is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind.
positive;Don't let the PG rating keep you away, this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining.
positive;But then again, what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as such, the different characters who appear and reappear in different scenes still meet each other and their stories are inevitably intertwined.
positive;Having been first introduced to Park's work via Oldboy, I was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it.
negative;I went into this film really wanting to like it - it headlined a film festival earlier in the year, and boasted an all-star cast.
negative;And the acting is just not there.<br /><br />I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owed someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this film.<br /><br />My wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of Jackie Chan on the front (as though he was playing the lead) and thought that a good JC flick would be fun to watch.
negative;The only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely Chloe Sevigny.
negative;This movie was an all around uninspiring film.
positive;But his wife spies on him, and confiscates all of it.
positive;Her untimely death, in a car accident, made this Ms. Shepitko's final film, unfortunately.<br /><br />After the opening mission is declared, there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but Shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting.
negative;It's foolish but funny.
positive;There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?).
negative;So, really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway.
positive;This film is amazing, while not perfect by Hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor, black and white that is true in many parts of the world.
positive;One can only hope for a DVD box set.
positive;- when a woman kills him.
negative;Nothing really happens.
positive;This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well.
negative;Ther is only one radio show.
negative;I guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people.
negative;Still, it's nice to see Schumacher practising for his Batman trainwrecks with a bit of the old neon paint and coloured lightbulbs.
negative;When I first viewed this movie, I didn't know the title of it.
negative;On the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing.
positive;The writer (I don't know who it was, check IMDB) either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love, poetry, and drama.
positive;especially the lead played by <br /><br />Lino Ventura & in a smaller BUT vital role Jean Paul Belmondo.
positive;Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish loan shark who plots revenge on a Catholic that has looked down on him.
negative;That in itself was worth the 25¬¢ I paid for this movie.<br /><br />Worth watching on TCM or paying a quarter for.
negative;And the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit.
positive;Overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too sappy in the romance department.
positive;Used to watch this when i was very little, then used to watch my videos.
negative;He is a cab driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than the later chauffeur to Chan in the later films.
positive;She's caught and tries to escape but, since she's a mute, she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly.
negative;They seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show.
negative;This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had.
negative;The movie substitutes good looks for good acting, a cryptic plot for a good story line, and self-absorption for character development.
positive;the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present.
negative;This is of course the filmmakers intent, but couldn't there have been a better way to do this without making us watch all that garbage.
positive;Highly Recommended.
positive;It certainly is one of Eastwood's best REAL performances.
negative;Hey, are they ghosts too?
negative;I caught the North American premiere of this at the Chicago International Film Festival.
positive;To that effect, I'm sure that none of what has been shown, is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of facts.<br /><br />The performances are good, on the whole, as can be expected.
negative;A ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big Caucasian male.
negative;You'll have to be a fanatic Brad Pitt fan to search it out.
negative;Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.
negative;"No matter what you loved about it...<br /><br />The Aeon Flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that.<br /><br />Karyn Kusama, the so called ""director"" of the film, was hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film."
positive;It's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though.
negative;But Nolte's character is never believable.
positive;I also enjoyed Robertson Dean in the role of the father... he is a true professional, and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace.
positive;shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic!
negative;i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam.
positive;Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.
positive;The people of Russia are threatened by two major enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire.
positive;At one hour and 15 minutes, this looks to have been a B movie.
negative;Oh and also there's that obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work.
negative;Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat.
positive;Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended.
negative;The moral message was too preachy (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the ending was way too overblown that it will make you wonder why you sat down to such a foolish movie in the first place.
positive;How they must adhere to all the rigid rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track, what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language.
positive;This is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to everyone.
positive;He puts on a tough exterior, especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave.
positive;Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave.
negative;Independent film that would make Hollywood proud.
negative;This movie had potential to be a good little high school thriller.
negative;Anyway, the film was just all around bad and rightfully skewered by MST3K.<br /><br />Avoid this one if possible.
negative;I caught the second half of this on tv and, having never seen this one before, thought I would watch it...
negative;But the script is against them.
positive;The film goes onto depict how the butcher serves his time, and returns to life with his daughter in care, and having to come to terms with a life with no future.<br /><br />The graphic opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered, and the full frontal birth of the butchers daughter puts you a brutal frame of mind that stays with you throughout the film.<br /><br />The snappy flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality.
negative;"<br /><br />So all in all...this movie helped some ""C"" through ""Z"" level actors pay their rent for another month, and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality."
negative;This film struggles to keep it's audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting.
positive;The main story involves the family and it is very thought-provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene.
positive;man and his enemy-contact, it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton!
positive;<br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal.
negative;"I guess the sequel to this story will be ""For Our Honeymoon We Move From Siberia to Greenland""."
negative;Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural.
positive;For the moment, however, Edgar Briggs' life will have to remain top secret.<br /><br />CODA: I have seen a number of episodes recently and I'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well.
negative;"I've long awaited for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of ""Jaws"" or ""Predator""."
positive;Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), none could have played Jed better.
negative;Each character are factory produced mannequins who behave in the same manner every episode.
positive;i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time.
negative;It is a banal show with even more banal characters.
positive;_Head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate.
negative;Also, it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set.
positive;"""He's no common injun."
negative;"Like ""good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you""."
negative;Aside from a few clever techniques employed, the movie rarely connects the dizzying thematics with the dull script, ultimately coming across as a cheap exploitation into the cult genre, substituting hollow imagery for genuine substance.
positive;Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals, and unconditional surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation, this was the summon substance of the United States victory in World War II!!
positive;His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns.
negative;Later the film reveals another killing, again by a woman of a man, , and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses.In short, Volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology, and so I write an ideological critique.
positive;After all, she did have to play straight man to an entire planet.
negative;No chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him.
negative;The lines are rough, the 3d work inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this film) But the backgrounds are corrects.
positive;This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day.
negative;"Well, ""Pola X"" ain't no ""Last Year at Marienbad""."
negative;Tora!.
positive;However, this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues.
positive;But only see the movies if you consider yourself a die-hard fan after seeing the TV series.
positive;He has a lot of potential, and I hope to see more of him soon.
positive;Hannah Goslar's testimony was also very interesting.
positive;I first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid-1970's, and was immediately taken with it.
positive;And what great action music it was!
negative;This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, particularly if you've got beer.
positive;"At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground, there he meets with Bugs, his next trainer."
negative;A few friends go out on Halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son.
negative;There are actors from every where, and I'm sure that they could've found better ones to fit the roles.
positive;You see, Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy.
negative;All you had to do was include most of the real events (even embellish them!
negative;There is never any suggestion that the British thought his behavior was strange.
negative;But if you are young you will probably love it.
negative;I cant believe John Badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap.
negative;Bypass this yawner.
negative;"'Tweety's S.O.S', then, basically amounts to ""this time let's put 'em on a boat""."
negative;Were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers?<br /><br />Two final questions: The cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach -- WHERE did she come from?
negative;The shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint.<br /><br />The best parts in this movie are with Sunny Deol.
positive;We saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us, maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre....<br /><br />They're all pods, all of them!
negative;"The writing was very weak, which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly, the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.<br /><br />This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf.<br /><br />(Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere)."
negative;"The commercials make it look like ""Saw"" and even use the music from those films to sell it."
negative;"And they run around Pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an M. Night Shymalan Movie.<br /><br />The ""They"" is kind of a misnomer."
positive;We never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration, and the viewer is free to decide upon his well-shaded persona.
negative;The purple prose style, in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation.
negative;If you want to laugh at this movie get the MST3k episode its really funny...full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable
negative;She immediately doesn't hit it off with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell).
positive;The true star of the film, she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way, needing to steer back on course, hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return.<br /><br />Besides the realism to the story, as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across, I also loved the visual style of the film.
negative;"I'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter."""
positive;Shes the man is great.
positive;Yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all of his other films except the Straight Story.
positive;All those fountains!
negative;Sure, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know it.
negative;I do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny.
positive;Lance has never changed an order.
positive;I was wrong.
positive;i.e., Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book.
positive;Cassel and Bellucci are amazing in the leading roles.
positive;there are enough stripper and VD references to fill two shows sometimes).
positive;It brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson.<br /><br />Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability.
positive;Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure.
positive;My vote: 9 out of 10
positive;<br /><br />-9/10
negative;However, when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better.
positive;"Perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it; nothing like it had ever been seen before, and it still remains something of an oddity in the world of music videos."
negative;The men walk around a couple of spare sets, wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them.
positive;Jason Alexander is a wonderful choice for Duckman, and his performance is a comedic 180 from his days on Seinfeld (even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there).
negative;The ripped up bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store.
negative;I mean, David Bradley's no Oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining.
positive;"""House of Dracula"" is a good sequel to ""House of Frankenstein""."
negative;The army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room.
negative;But let's face it: they're coarse, fast, Philistine, vulgar, but exhilarating.
negative;now?
positive;!<br /><br />Aaron: He must be good looking Jane: How do you know that?
positive;I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie.
positive;)<br /><br />But make no mistake, it is not the music that makes this movie unique, it is the story itself, plain and simple.
positive;Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.
negative;If you are home on a weekend, very bored and lack the will to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie.
negative;Anyway, if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns.
negative;in the background at any moment.
positive;"From intelligently spoken lines (both from acting and the script), to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, all the way to the final meeting at that train stop; these children are more than just child stars advancing a story, they are leading us with emotion, persuasion, and a realism unseen by today's children."
positive;For a film that is so little known, I was surprised at the quality of the performances.
negative;"She always wanted to perform before a ""captive audience""?"
negative;"EVPs that could be a rat farting, cold spots in a drafty house, and ""orbs"" that even the Ghost Hunters themselves discount as dust."
negative;A really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time, and our equally valuable leisure time, by bothering to support this utterly predictable and plainly formulaic piece of commercial junk.
positive;"I suppose all of us have a streak of ""insanity"" inside us .... perhaps some more than others."
positive;It really felt like I was watching a whole new movie.<br /><br />While the DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, you'll be hard-pressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed.
positive;I remember running home from school almost every day to catch KTLA's channel 5 monster movies, but never did I run home faster then when this movie was scheduled.
negative;How can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age?
negative;Heck, the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene, and even that could of been better.<br /><br />Honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting this, else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.
positive;In my opinion, this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of America's most remembered serial killers.
positive;Sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents.
positive;There's some wonderful things going on in this one - Shirley Knight's best performance (an underrated actress), a road trip in the late 1960's, James Caan very restrained and moving, Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, lonely, motorcycle cop), and a touching script with F. Coppola behind the wheel.<br /><br />If this had been made five years LATER by some nobody, it would have been a smash (so much for timing).
positive;It is cinema verite at it's best, and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events.<br /><br />Which of the two is more amazing, Sarandon or Penn?
negative;It looked like it had a great story and nice special effects.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.
negative;Then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director.
positive;Cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized.
positive;This wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother.
positive;Then followed that up with the second best movie Bruce Willis has ever been in (The Last Boyscout).Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight.<br /><br />If you're a fan of action films, this has it all...Action, Comedy, Thrills, then tops it of with more Action, Comedy and Thrills.
positive;Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, which he often does in the Universal Studios monster films.
positive;I've always remembered a few key bits from the show, and some of the lines are very quotable to those who haven't forgotten it completely.
negative;"From the mood in the audience, I wasn't the only one.<br /><br />The film takes a long time to get to the conflict, and then refuses to resolve it, opting instead to tell us the story is ""To Be Continued""."
negative;"This isn't a short film but a report, but considering how dull the first two entries were, Herzog's bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious ""time"" concept very neatly.<br /><br />Jarmusch: As was to be almost expected, this once-interesting film-maker (with the brain of a peanut; a talented idiot savant) serves us yet another doze of pointlessness."
positive;These three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job.
positive;Instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give me a break) I felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with.
positive;On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that David Holm be presented to her at once.
negative;I saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (Now the famous Crobar Night-club)on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81.
positive;The trailers'd left me an impression of either yet another Dujardin one-man-show-turned-film (√† la _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive, stupid French comedy.
positive;"He is described as ""a brave soldier and lover of women."""
positive;One evening, after his wife was stalking him, he explodes and hits her.
negative;Camera-work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye.<br /><br />There's really no-one to love and no-one to hate in Imperium.
positive;It's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there.<br /><br />In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting, and fun.
negative;I am not who you think I am!
positive;What comes across as a tender moment in the Korean version is a sad, somber one in the DC.
positive;!I loved this film and so did AFI, probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo!
positive;Let me start by saying that if you're expecting subtle humour, you're in the wrong theatre.
positive;Her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene.
negative;An abominable piece of trash that the director and/or producer should be ashamed to put their name on.
negative;It's in color, for one thing.
negative;Feels like everyone just phoned it in.
negative;This just disgusted me.
negative;Snarling Chinese gangsters.
negative;Truth be told, there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock-fans would love - wanna see some realllly bad, funny 70's films, put on anything by Greydon Clark.
positive;It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the TV series.
negative;"Watch this ""film"" backwards."
negative;"Usually in these movies, the actresses aren't really acting, they give very ""natural"" performances, and they're quite sympathetic, fun, and likable."
negative;The gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly Video Toaster effect that has to be freeze-framed to be (dis)believed.
negative;So that's absolute bull.
positive;But once she got a little screen time, she made a solid contribution.<br /><br />Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he's played many times before, but he makes a first-rate president none the less.<br /><br />Another bonus is that the place was practically empty.
negative;There was none these in Paha maa.
positive;Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well.
negative;I don't think they ever quite had a following, but apparently to director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film.
positive;It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love.
negative;"Here's a couple of paragraphs out of an essay I wrote for university about TBOR.<br /><br />""The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about sex, power and a talented dancer's struggle to regain his sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three cloaked women."
negative;It starts off with some odd religious killings that don't make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan).
positive;This director hardly has anything else to his name higher than Return To Salem's Lot, but he displays true stumbling man-child genius in this creation!
negative;While DH can be quite far-fetched, at least it explores women in more multi-faceted ways.
positive;The filmmaker is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go outside the norm, frustrated, unique, astute etc.
negative;"""Pola X"" achieved membership in that august group."
positive;I've seen people on television with Tourettes syndrome and they do not just blurt out bad words.
negative;"The French title for this movie says it all: ""Inexplicable""."
negative;Dumb, dumb.
positive;A well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast.
positive;Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a TV soap, this is 90 minutes of sustained, sharp as a knife film making.
negative;My overall grade is a 3/10.
negative;Why was he even in this movie?
negative;If I were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary I would expect it.<br /><br />In summary: Avoid, avoid avoid.
positive;"""Sharky's Machine"" is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to strut his talents and he spray-paints the machine, the film plot, with colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of moods within a nourish story.<br /><br />Made in 1981 at 119 minutes (lengthy for the time period), the film did well, with box office grosses at $37,800,000."
positive;It is a portrayal of lost innocence.
positive;But Tommy wins out anyway as he and the daughter sneak away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon bond during an air raid - unfortunately for him, she reveals she is married.
negative;I even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him.
negative;So many potentially promising conflicts between the family members that could have been developed and elaborated but it was all dropped and not taken care of.
negative;Don't waste your money.
negative;It's a total waste of time and money!<br /><br />Here's what I see in this waste of a DVD.
negative;Who knows.
negative;An absolute, rock-bottom dud.
positive;Well done!
positive;Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a mecca for all of the arts.
negative;The writing for this film is horrible as well as the execution.
positive;"Not only does it appear to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, it portrays the geographic Paris; the streets accessible only by staircases, the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity, and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell, in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood."
positive;"His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished ""wow-ed"" me."
positive;The director it most recalls to me is John Landis (yeah, go ahead and howl about what a peasant I am).
positive;She was a victim of the Holocaust, and as this otherwise excellent documentary has so vividly testified, she was Hitler's most famous victim.<br /><br />Besides the Anne Frank's story...the stories from her family members and friends and survivors of the Holocaust were engrossing, vivid and powerful.
negative;The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill?
positive;Well, one time you are sort of disappointed, what you think will happen does not, but it makes the joke even funnier.<br /><br />If you like the Road Runner shorts you will love this one.
negative;Knightly focuses on the Elizabeth's forthrightness, but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time.
positive;It's also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time, showing the seediness, grit and dirt that was endemic of a New York still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it.
negative;It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula.
positive;"In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood's ""Rendition"" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood."
negative;There was no rescue seen or hinted at.<br /><br />Can it be true that Japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspect's ability to reach for a weapon?
positive;To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral.
negative;It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing.
positive;Both shows sold out, and for good reason.
positive;This was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good.
positive;You won't believe your eyes.
negative;Offcource the acting is good but i did'n't expect anything less from these perfect actors.
negative;You'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals.
negative;What a dope.<br /><br />Rates four stars for sheer unintentional humor.
positive;Acting wise Rakesh Bedi(Raja} & Satish Shah is brilliant whereas Swaroop Sampat is plain bad but I think she gets the job done.
negative;I am now an atheist.<br /><br />10.
positive;"Her performance is top-notch; her character can't speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.And, oh boy, she did a wonderful job."
negative;Many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen.
negative;I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened?
negative;well, that's what these guys thought anyway.
positive;Tromeo and Juliet is perhaps the best Shakespeare modernization I have ever seen, not that there's much competition, but anyway...<br /><br />All in all, Tromeo and Juliet is definitely one of Troma's better movies, one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung.
positive;You get a chance to learn more about our beloved Doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much.
negative;She, Dr. Edelmann and the Monster all perish, while Talbot and Miliza casually leave the castle.<br /><br />Definitely the low point for Universal during it's classic horror years.
positive;It is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other TV shows will have come, gone and been forgotten.<br /><br />Some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet I laugh just as much at Mr. Bean's antics now as I did when I first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s.
positive;But it's missing another half hour!
positive;Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles.
negative;This is only the second review I have written.
positive;We had good reason to do so, the Asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - the Grudge, and a Tale of Two Sisters.
negative;Lots of scenes (80% of the movie) are with conversation only.
positive;In Anna Christie we are in O'Neill country, a place of sea, storms and fog, a feeling of all-pervading and damnable uncertainty, which we would now call ambivilance, or anxiety neurosis.
negative;Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye.
negative;Even the ever promising Kangana Renaut's talent (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here as she plays Ruhi, the woman who has captured the attention of both the leading male characters played by Bobby Deol (who plays A.J.
negative;3 Son Tommy for the first time.
positive;I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped airing it.
negative;Rumiko Takahashi has done a LOT better then this.
negative;I would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free.<br /><br />As for the music being so in step that didn't come across either.
negative;My wife and kids have left me and hate me because I couldn't speak or hardly move after seeing this.
positive;You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end.
positive;This series shows what good, clean comedy is.<br /><br />If this series were to air in the current year I would have given it 9/10.
positive;It is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer.
negative;I came across it one night on the web.
negative;"Ryan, the intrepid leader of this pack of Penn State Graduates, is claiming to see ""visions"" of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting..."
negative;Things only got worse from there, as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another, followed by an ending so anti-climatic it's like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead.
negative;), pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones, and for Pete's sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while.
positive;As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being Jewish is akin to being an animal.<br /><br />The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal.
positive;The story is of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter.
negative;But then again, the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself.
positive;on the upper right hand of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow-moving images magnified the impact of the scene's real-life coincidence.
negative;Rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting.
negative;Yes even Flex...I'm so upset about it though.
positive;Because there is very little if any CGI, there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects.
positive;Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard.
positive;We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner.
negative;His family decides to stick with him.
negative;Politically it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the Russian one with values like honor and duty.
positive;"As always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the Disney magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is... well... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hounds Napoleon and Lafayette into a couple of bumbling Southern-fried rednecks."
positive;It's the only Hamlet that I'd invest in...
negative;Hopefully Pell James can recover from this role...
negative;And why do they call it a thriller???
negative;For you see, aliens sent Chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory.
negative;In the book, AIDEN freaks out when she turns into a wolf, and cries like a chick, throws stuff at her, and so she panics, and jumps out the window.
negative;I don't think I've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud, as it did here.
positive;"NFB of C outdid themselves here!<br /><br />Une hommage du Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard, merci, M. Richard."
positive;Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.<br /><br />The main character, the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina.
positive;Those were our friends, rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures.<br /><br />It's especially poignant for those who attended any of New York City's other elite, top-tier high schools, especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech.
negative;The Momma beast that implanted these little critters looks like a giant bald parrot with claws.
positive;There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men.
negative;Don't spend the big bucks on this film.
positive;A film that can do that is a rare a special thing.
positive;Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director.<br /><br />Jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming.
positive;It's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--I loved it and I'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy.
negative;"His clipped British tones don't belong in this film; and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangster's apprentice in 24 hours is mad."
negative;There is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system files.<br /><br />I could go on but I can't be bothered.<br /><br />A porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage.
negative;It is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father.
negative;Hardly.
positive;They encounter the sadistic Edmond Rackham who rules over a native tribe¬Öand a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the island's swamps.
negative;The best word to describe it is STUPID!
negative;As for the song, it's mildly amusing.
negative;You'll laugh as J.G.
negative;"The worst thing from ""Harlem nights"" are both the scenario and its terrible decors."
negative;Every time there is an interesting, verifiable shred of evidence -- the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s -- the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from Nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander.
negative;The supporting cast includes Adam Baldwin(no relation to his more famous namesakes) & M.Emmet Walsh who has appeared in many films, also I noticed Art Evans who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2.
negative;The movie at times seems like a music video.
positive;"Las Vegas is very funny and focuses on the substance.....<br /><br />The sets are amazing and the scenes outside are breathtaking; the characters are all very fun and cool.<br /><br />The women are a plus....<br /><br />Holly Sims is lovable as the daughter of James Caan who heads the security of the casino."
negative;This one takes the cake.
positive;In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis.
positive;It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children.
positive;Here, the scares are merited and effective.
negative;A patchwork film without a continuous story.
positive;Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?)
negative;I was hoping for a '12 and Holding', 'The War', or 'Lie' and all I got was a waste of time.
negative;From nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed FBI agents are, in fact, the killers.
negative;Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty poor as Fanny, and the rest are not much better, everybody is very stilted and unnatural.
negative;If I had to watch it without that show, I would've stopped watching it before it was over.
positive;I love it.
negative;This was a decent movie for the first half.
negative;House Party 4 followed no preset design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down.
negative;OK.
positive;"With the ""String Theory"" it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines ARE possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them.<br /><br />Although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic, I found the show VERY interesting and informative."
positive;Bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde, and this achieves the same effect as it did for Winona Ryder (`Edward Scissorhands') and Christina Ricci (`Sleepy Hollow').
negative;Do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry.
positive;www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html An excellent TV series that should be captured on DVD.
positive;The performances by the entire cast were very good, excellent, in fact but Peggy's role as played by Blackwell made the movie.
positive;When i first saw the band, i dismissed them straight away without even listening to the music.
negative;In contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies (as well as stalk n' slashers) of 70s and 80s.
positive;We were headed out into the cold, cruel world, leaving home for college then parts unknown.
positive;And the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it.
positive;Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.
positive;He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though Prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life.
positive;However, what's interesting here is how Belden makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clich√©s of murder mystery plays.
negative;After watching this I was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie.
positive;Disgusted by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his lone training.
negative;"He throws up, but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.<br /><br />Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"", (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended."
positive;"What most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the ""cult leader"" David Koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff."
positive;"Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long."
negative;His life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor).
negative;I'm so sad that Flex got told he can get away with it.
negative;Although I found the acting excellent, and the cinematography beautiful, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation.<br /><br />One of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves, rather than go on.
positive;Lots of laughs sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />What made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre, it was sort of like the movie was still playing.
positive;"'Romance' was at various points hilarious, but I accept that the French sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners; indeed, dozens of IMDb reviewers detected no comedy in Romance."
positive;I was absolutely enthralled by the powerful messages and plot line within this film.
negative;The card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game.
positive;Chapter One, opens with countless, languid images, where bleak, barren landscapes scroll by, dead animals rot, broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun.
negative;]<br /><br />The film opens in a women's prison, although not like any prison I've ever seen or heard of -- the inmates wear whatever they wish - and seem to be having a party.<br /><br />Karmen does some frantic dancing, and the woman warden of the prison, Angelique,[a magnificently handsome woman]is definitely erotically interested.
negative;Not that Lord Greystoke's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him.
negative;"That's it.<br /><br />When you see ""Chained Heat"" and watch Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.<br /><br />Certainly not, ""Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come!"
positive;The (mostly) Italian cast, with a few exceptions works well.
negative;If you like the Isle of Wight, don't 'reach for the moon', reach for the holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development!
positive;Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
negative;To paraphrase, Sybil is as Sybil does and everything Sybil does is done perfect.
negative;-The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ.
positive;I have never before watched a film three times in one night.
positive;Is that the sawmill owner from Twin Peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust?
negative;Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema.
negative;"THEY DO THE UNDERDOG THEME SONG TO RAP (read that with a silent ""C"" at the beginning)!"
negative;The same scenario follows and the American commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier.
positive;In fact, it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts.
negative;Done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had from watching their later movies.
positive;Definitely worth seeing.
negative;So why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this?
positive;And tell me, how many really remember the music for Moonraker?
positive;He challenges and makes short work of the established Karate schools he encounters.
negative;"""Real world"" issues dealt with blatant unoriginality."
positive;Would things be different?.
negative;I am sure it would have still been quite bad, but at least it would have been more watchable and fun which this movie is not despite its trying to be funny.
positive;She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles.
positive;Compliments without overpowering.<br /><br />If you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.
positive;This is a fine American classic.
negative;They're led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship, build many imitations of it, and colonize earth.
positive;"Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic."
positive;<br /><br />Pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship.<br /><br />Pierre, Lucie, and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain...<br /><br />Lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he ?
positive;"An underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air.<br /><br />Kelly's character in the 1980 ""Xanadu"" also was named Danny McGuire."
negative;But Nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be.<br /><br />What a waste.
negative;Cleopatra's big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an Egyptian theme park.
positive;"Awesome.<br /><br />EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the $150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect ""Faberge egg"" enfolding an unforgettable heart.<br /><br />Finally (I promise), my second ""first"" -- I've never before posted a commentary on any film I've seen.<br /><br />Thank you again, Mr. Richard Bell!"
positive;I smiled through the whole film.
negative;Lucky I saw them on Amazon for like 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: if I had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality, Crisis and Expect to Die, I would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted.
positive;Keerthana, and she is one of the few child actors I've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying.
positive;"""Balance of Terror"" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made."
negative;Surprisingly I had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before Mystery Science Theater 3000 tore it to pieces.
negative;She has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no-one else can see.
positive;<br /><br />For me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games.
negative;Perhaps I just do not like his way of speaking or his stature.
negative;They drop pigs in parachutes.
negative;"Perhaps the weakest film in the ""Kharis"" series, despite the presence of John Carradine (miscast as an Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, hilariously afflicted by a bad case of Parkinson's Disease) supporting Lon Chaney Jr. as the titular creature - if indeed it was him under the bandages, as his contribution is negligible at best!"
negative;The only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the KKK was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy...
negative;I hear it is based on some comic book or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that I have never heard of, but whatever it is based on, there is nothing original in this excruciatingly boring movie.
positive;In this case, he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country?
negative;Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it.
positive;The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters.
negative;A moronic horror comedy that is NOT even slightly funny!!
negative;However, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that Chupacabras are a typically Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don't really know where that fits in.
negative;The movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors (if we can use this word for these 2 guys).
negative;This is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing.
positive;The reality is the best argument against the death penalty.<br /><br />A 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking, and for the most important film made in years<br /><br />Thank you, Tim Robbins!<br /><br />
positive;It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey, Quo Vadis, and The Night of Iguana memorable.<br /><br />Why is this an unusual film?
positive;So we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.<br /><br />The idea may not be original but David Morse makes it so.
positive;I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we got three New York channels with our cable hook-up, and I think it was on Channel 11.
positive;So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air.
negative;"It's an eerie, intense movie, the sort the Brits do so well - definitely a ""chick flick"" the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost ""Wuthering Heights"" aura."
positive;It was very fun to watch!
positive;Why anyone wouldn't like his films is unknown to me, but for those who can't see the light, just avoid it.<br /><br />Everyone else: This is a classic.
negative;Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a drama actor can watch Pete's Meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed.
positive;I never cry!
negative;OUCH!!
positive;The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.
positive;i didn't want to because it was such an old film, how could that be good ?
positive;I'd love to get a good copy somewhere.
negative;Would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards?
positive;It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!!
negative;An example of a well done movie involving pretty twenty-something's getting killed is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (and the prequel too) that certainly instilled fear and had much less character logic flaws.
negative;"Even if ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dead Alive"" had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out, they'd still be entertaining."
negative;I tried to support this show in its decline, because I like human interest stories and Primetime used to have some very good ones.
negative;But I do have to agree that this movie has got some good 'special effects'.
negative;Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin.
positive;Debra even wields a sabre and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a staircase, she could do it all.<br /><br />What does work is Debra Paget as a princess.
positive;This is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons.
negative;The only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available.
negative;The opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch.
negative;So much talent and work went into something so vile.
negative;Period.
negative;An admittedly bravura finale, many quirky bits of business--and Forster looking great in the nude--make this a curiosity item, nothing more.
negative;Skip the film.
positive;<br /><br />The second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband.
positive;The soundtrack is basically Rap about stealing cars ^_^ SWEETTTT Movie!
negative;The film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the Japanese attack in Tora!
negative;"There's some soft-core (meaning: Teletubbie level) nudity and some blatant rip-offs of ""Predator""."
positive;Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious.
positive;This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film.
negative;The leading man's girlfriend shows up, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears.
negative;I was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it.
negative;"Picture a cross between ""Swamp Thing"" and Chaka from ""Land of the Lost"" and you'll get the idea."
negative;You know your film is bad when the guy that agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls won't even have a short walk-on role.
positive;Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother.
negative;He picks off some red crap and puts it in a spoon for her to freebase!
negative;Well¬Öwhat about the Nazi sergeant?
positive;It did create quit a disturbance though...
positive;"Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood's directorial debut with ""Play Misty For Me""."
positive;They used to come swarming out of the pass killing everything in sights.
negative;Basically, some woman has a Mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside of they're victims.
positive;The look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in.
negative;Very much like they ran out of ideas.
positive;And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there.
negative;The whole beginning story could have been great.
negative;It keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next, just to see!<br /><br />Probably the worst short film I have seen that looked big budget hollywood even though it was shot on some sort of video format.<br /><br />Instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent for some rather impressive set design, it would have been nicer to see a better executed story with some good direction.
positive;You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship, but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers.
negative;Save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on DVD.
positive;This was a rather unnerving look at an ostensibly functional family confronted by their daughter's druggie boyfriend.
positive;When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo.
negative;"Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as the softy ""bad guy""."
negative;This is a poor attempt of parody films.<br /><br />The cast is bad.
negative;"Seriously, every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a Call of Duty video game.<br /><br />The ""investigations"" -- the plot that each episode revolves around -- are interesting on the surface."
negative;This affair doesn't sizzle for even a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score.
positive;It isn't their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either.<br /><br />To me, it is the mis-en-scene of the entire movie.
negative;"This is so blatantly a made-for-TV ripoff of Black Widow (1987) - even the insect titles are so similar.<br /><br />If you want a better ""marrying for money"" movie, check out Black Widow, starring Debra Winger & Theresa Russell.<br /><br />These movie is cheesiness at its best..!"
negative;Other than that the movie is a waste of time.
negative;Imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over.
positive;But it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments.
negative;What to say about this movie?
negative;Personally, when I finally got out of the movie theater I felt like I had been scalped (or wish that I had so I wouldn't have suffered over 2 hours of mental rape).
negative;Later on, he stares at his bicycle, as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek.
positive;The scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool.
positive;Patricia Arquette amazingly portrays Laura Bowman, who we meet as a shut-down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son.
positive;Then of course, San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends.
negative;This seemed very silly to me.<br /><br />I am not unusually picky about a movie but, in my humble opinion, this one is definitely NOT recommended by me.
negative;Just watch them seethe at all the other characters, it's fun!<br /><br />In closing, the Headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun), but we can definitely say this ... this was a movie.
negative;I was shocked at how bad it was and unable to turn away from the disaster.
positive;They go back in the night to scare her & find scares for themselves.
negative;Completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema.
positive;Mr. Bell is far too modest in his film commentary.
positive;"""I don't flip."
negative;The plot is practically non-existent: violent guy trying to be nonviolent meets friendly family, friendly family is murdered, violent guy becomes violent again.
positive;Our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers.
positive;Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting.
positive;I would call it overall good entertainment
negative;"In this movie, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who ""discovered"" Santana."
negative;This movie is... horrible and wonderful at the same time.
positive;In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson like the bumbling fool that he is.
positive;This consists of artwork, behind-the-scenes footage, clips of the movie, and many interviews.
negative;"that aired every day on TV for children.<br /><br />My first reaction after showing this crap, was to load ""Bambi"" in my DVD-Player, to see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again, to see Disney on its climax again, to see the awesome art of handmade animation again."
positive;I cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for over 30 minutes.
positive;you know I've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good.
negative;In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable beyond belief.
positive;But it's inventive to catch if it's on TV late at night, and it functions rather well in that time slot.
positive;You do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike.
positive;Highly recommend.
positive;You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job.
negative;This is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie, and I had to utilize the fast-forward button so as not to doze off.
negative;It is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary.
positive;In fact, I recently bought an N64 purely so that I could own it and play it more often!
negative;I must agree about the Octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the Seaview.
positive;However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia.
negative;Reviewed in Edinburgh.
negative;Way too dark in some areas.
negative;He ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff(Boguslaw Linda)and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid(Katarzyna Figura).
negative;You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end.
positive;It's a true classic.
negative;A disgusting and horrible movie.
positive;Amanda B. did a great job as the main role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous Duke.
negative;"""Rachel"" is played by Laura Ramsey.<br /><br />6."
positive;You take him in alive, you'll have every 'Pache in the territory coming after him.
positive;"I enjoyed it very much; it's very well put together and very informative."
negative;This movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly acted.
negative;"They don't help, and their careers in cinema after this ""film"" are officially over by the way.<br /><br />3."
positive;By now, the game's stale, right?<br /><br />The jokes have been done.
positive;At times, I almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight.
negative;If you are trying to sway me, show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at Hot Topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer.
positive;After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.<br /><br />The film is terrific on many levels.
negative;"The script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent.<br /><br />The humor is not just subtle and sublime; it's nowhere to be found."
positive;The best performance is Charles Boyer as the head Lama.
negative;In the film they do.
positive;There are SO SO MANY women like Karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did.
negative;a boring, confusing plot, long gray shots(thank God Corman did most of his films in black and white, since his color stuff still manages to look somehow gray)two or three locations max, stupid and lame props and special effects, and lots and lots of dull dialog.
positive;He was very authentic.
negative;1 Bolo Yeung is in the movie ten minutes altogether including when he's serving iced drinks to his boss.
negative;One good actor after another turns in lamentable dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable.
negative;Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless.
positive;not the same words but the message is all that counts.
positive;"Look out Hollywood, there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little Long Island, independent film called, ""Eddie Monroe."""
negative;!This film is not anywhere near good.I would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it,trust me,I feel your pain as well!!!
positive;THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar.<br /><br />Almodovar has always single handed the flag for Spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came Amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag?
negative;A pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving British club scene, Sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments, but does very little else.
negative;Let's see...assemble the prettiest cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack)...throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up...and viola!
negative;K.B.
negative;The makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever Michael was going through.
positive;Plus there's some emotional points to the film.
positive;They mention a tiny bit about the sequels, and someone almost gives something away, but he catches himself in time (shoot!).
negative;I mean really sucked.
negative;Stay away from this movie.
negative;The positive points can be summed up easily: the photography is splendid, and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie?
positive;Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen.
positive;But fear not.
negative;"However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was ""Just a Nightmare"" and it was very well written!!"
negative;"Unlike the rest of the seasons, I personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries; good god they're such likable characters."
negative;Why did Tobey lose to Jake and Christian lose to Adam?
negative;No, it's not shocking.
positive;"""Wonderful!!!"""
positive;She has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her.
positive;However these problems really arn't that major, and I was still able to enjoy the film.
positive;7 out of 10.
negative;This must be the most boring film I ever saw.
positive;You see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not disappointed.
negative;So lets say you are a producer, you have some money, and you somehow got Richard gear and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script...but , why bother?
negative;I know this commentary went more social, but it couldn't be helped, as this movie begged it.
positive;I cheered.
negative;"""Fuckland"" is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
positive;So far Miguel Bardem's career it's been one of the more dreadful of recent Spanish cinema.
negative;Tch.
negative;If it gets any better, I will come back here and let you know, but somehow I doubt that will happen.
positive;<br /><br />Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
positive;Presently, Peter Sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, Where Does It Hurt?, has by its nature become almost impossible to find.
negative;She's a 40-something year old woman who isn't DE-LISH.
positive;I wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally.
negative;I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later, if only for the humor I derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.
positive;Added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen.
positive;Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
positive;At once alien and familiar.
positive;The story is rather odd and simple, and above all, extremely original.
negative;Even the tolerable Frances Grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory I have of her from the set, is of the AD asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take, she subconsciously 'pulled her knickers out of her crack!'.
positive;"Dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were Bond and Johnson, who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an Oscar for his work in ""The Last Picture Show""."
positive;While the narration hearkens to a simpler, purer era, a portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel, ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature.<br /><br />In the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same, yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality.
positive;I really don't know how to classify this film.
positive;"Full of quick and sparkling dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade, it is head and shoulders above 99% of ""Comedy"" as it is presented today."
negative;They mention Herbie, Fang (now a worthless tiny furry dog that Carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro'd the show.
negative;Don't waste your time on this utter trash.
positive;The photography, sound, music and the performances were the best.
positive;For me it took me to a place and I came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful, starched and pained, barren and splendid.
positive;The game itself is great.
positive;Dear David (from Beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie?
positive;while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it...
positive;So, to help him along in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got Slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work.
negative;And the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.<br /><br />Now for the poorly made sequel.
negative;Years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire.
negative;How could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley?
positive;So, I've rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films.
negative;Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic.
negative;"And I couldn't help but imagine that Jack Nocholson's Melvin Udall character fro ""As Good As It Gets,"" with his massive OCD affliction, could provide counsel to the anti-heroine to assist in dealing with he obsession which was the basis of this opus."
positive;It shows he wasn't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance.
positive;It's a testament to actor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic, still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character.
negative;DON'T EVER watch it!
positive;Well, you know, not all movies need special effects.
negative;I'm bored.
positive;The music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict.
positive;But for now, we're sticking with off beat and really entertaining films like this one!
positive;"Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down."
positive;What is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world.
negative;Its baby minder stabs himself rather than let the alien shrimp crawl out of his body, and the oily guy(and the other guy) burn the parrot-alien to death with a Molotov cocktail.
negative;Buyer beware.
positive;I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels.
positive;So if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band.
positive;Give it a chance.
negative;And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time.
negative;I hated him and not in that good 'Anti-hero' way, he was just a dull, idiotic, self-absorbed character that I felt nothing towards) but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I couldn't believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was, and how they cried and it moved them.
positive;Unfortunately, that is all you can see.
positive;The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits.
negative;Every performance is flat and unfeeling, except Fondacaro's.
negative;On the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes.
positive;The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie.
negative;It is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding.
positive;Possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts.
negative;I am actually watching this movie right now and, with every word, am stunned you all swallowed this shitte.
negative;Poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!).
negative;Granny, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?
negative;I'm not going to argue that.
negative;The movie lacks any creative random tech, and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives.
negative;This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history.
negative;Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
negative;One of the party guys is dead (he wasn't dead in fact, he woke up later), the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything.
positive;"We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say ""Jingle Bells""."
positive;Sorry once again for the tangent.<br /><br />Toy Soldiers is fun.
negative;Technically OK, Just bad, bad, bad...
positive;See if you can spot John Cusack as the angry messenger!
negative;"This is one of the most shallow movies I've had the misfortune of seeing, it poses as deep well...but when you get right down to it, it's nothing special.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the core of America's audience will do what they're told and follow the ""It's about controversial material so it must be good!"""
negative;Or maybe cause the end of the world, I'm afraid I wasn't paying much attention.
positive;There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story.
negative;"""Graduation Day,"" an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by Herb Freed, whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty."
negative;"I don't recall a Bible passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember Noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like ""hoist the mainstay!"""
positive;And that food inspector scene is the best!
negative;It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about.
negative;I hope the directors won't make any other movie because this movie bankrupts them.
negative;But actually it ends up worse.<br /><br />Avoid.
positive;I can't really say what it's about, really.<br /><br />Seriously, I'm a HUGE anime fan, and I've got around 50 full series, and I'm not kidding when I say that, even though I haven't finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya, it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection.
positive;a very surprisingly underrated movie.
negative;I have always been a Me Me Lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films.
negative;This movie plumbs the depths of inanity and is almost completely unwatchable.
positive;Billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance.<br /><br />I don't know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by, but I thought it was a much older flick.
negative;The acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad, which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this.
positive;When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped.
positive;Later she overhears him talking to himself and berating her.
negative;I have seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you name it and I've seen it.
negative;The movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching (woman's role in the workplace, the TV news-biz, the cheating family man, the working wife and mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendships, et al), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since Burns only half-heartedly examines the issues.
negative;Other illogical parts feature.
positive;One non- physical hardship Oyama faced was prejudice due to his Korean ancestry and he spent time proving that loyalties were to Japan and Japanese Karate.
positive;"I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."
negative;In the *BOOK* not only does VIVIAN not kill GABRIEL, I do believe they END UP TOGETHER.
negative;His acting was very good, but his appearance threw me off.<br /><br />-VIVIAN had NO parents in the movie.
positive;"Close-minded opponents of Italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", but the truth is that this is so much more!"
negative;Just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead happens to be the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, mentioned a great deal in earlier films but never actually seen.
negative;The Bimbos: Usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these, but here we have two.
negative;Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break-in, then his mind, by being accused by the police as being the murderer, and finally is life, by getting blasted by Ameila herself.
negative;It is refreshing to see that Roeves is still getting work, having also appeared in the 1998 British film 'The Acid House' and even more recently alongside the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in 'The Dark'.
negative;If Khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself.
positive;The only problem I had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr. wonderbird (A large talking green bird)to save them.
positive;I love this movie!
positive;"The entire cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a dashing, clever, BRITISH Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck overacts appropriately as Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual distracted, annoyed self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as ""Mervyn"" the Sheriff of Rottingham, and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield, and the sadly underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men.<br /><br />There are similarities to Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles...and every other Mel Brooks movie."
positive;This was unusual: a modern-day film which was ultra-nice.
negative;The plot seemed simple enough about the world being divided into subclasses and people needed identity cards and the actor Tim Robbins playing an investigator who goes to shanghai to investigate a employee stealing ID cards, which turns out to be the actress Samantha Morton.<br /><br />You think from that summary the rest of the story should intertyne but it doesn't it just confuses the audience even more with different storyline that don't relate.<br /><br />If you thinking of seeing this movie let me save u the trouble DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE.
negative;A couple of them take showers.
positive;I think that although the acting isn't all that great, it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script.
negative;You'd figure with twice the fish in the title there would be twice as many monster fish preying on the characters, but alas, this is not the case.<br /><br />The story starts with a photojournalist and her brother coming to Venezuela to do a story on one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation quickly changes to one of wanting to find diamonds, which are apparently fairly plentiful there.<br /><br />There's not a lot of real action or danger in this movie.
positive;She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is.
positive;"Chan walking in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow ""glancing"" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory."
positive;I was lucky enough to see this at this years Tribeca film festival.
positive;Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them.
negative;And I didn't even watch the end.
positive;If anyone ever reads this and has a copy I will pay you for a copy of it or please let me know where I could find one.
positive;One of the best of it's kind and a teen movie classic.
negative;After watching this movie on tv, I looked it up in the IMDB and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7.6!
negative;"But ""Atlantis: Milo's Return""?"
negative;"It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ""The Sopranos,"" as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all."
negative;But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.
negative;But that is not the intent of the film, as the script has him being admired and trusted by the British commandos.
positive;<br /><br />Omar Metwally plays the suspected terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, Egyptian national and green card-carrying hubby of American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon).
negative;Some of them may have overacted a bit (oh, just a wee smidgen!
negative;And you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with.
positive;Both are reflective of the characters themselves.
positive;Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.<br /><br />Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing.
negative;This is a very interesting acquaintance!
negative;<br /><br />But the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue.
positive;We all have choices we can exercise at will, and we often do not always (want to) see how these affect others, who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance.
negative;This is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones.
positive;At the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own.
negative;And who is he anyway?
negative;<br /><br />-ahem- But that's not the point.<br /><br />The title?
positive;Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one.
negative;In fact, this movie so demoralized me that I am sorry I went.
negative;"""Eden"" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I might add.<br /><br />2."
positive;.... Made by Canadians from Toronto for $25,000 and released in May 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies by October 2005.
negative;"I feel that the ""steamy"" love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that I've ever scene in a movie that wasn't porn."
positive;Perhaps it is too smart for its own good.
positive;Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham.
positive;<br /><br />One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life.<br /><br />I always found Bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice he was the comedian whose big break never came, reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences.
negative;The pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but doesn't budge an inch.
positive;A favorite scene that could have been handled with generality, of which I have seen in other films, was the birthday scene for Bobby.
negative;"Naturally, ""We Wuz Robbed"", the retarded title of this little sleep-inducer, is about how the poor, gullible and infinitely idealistic Democrats WUZ ROBBED by Bush and his EVIL EVIL team of THIEVES."
positive;Take a subject I didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you?
positive;I'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war.
positive;- which naturally horrified everyone.<br /><br />This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who had written for the 'Doctor' series.
negative;But again, the acting was excellent so many of the individual scenes were entertaining, but as you became increasingly aware of the lack of underpinning ideas, even the acting lost its sense.
negative;"""Two-fisted tales"" contains three foolish and childish episodes - genre isn't actually horror or action, more like something in between."
positive;This story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome.
positive;The ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat Jay Adams rating as the saddest and most tragic: He blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail.
negative;It seems there's a tribe of snake-worshipping people in a remote mountain region of Northern China, where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers.
positive;"Given the era in which it was made, and the obvious exploitation aspect, it is still one of the better B comedies of the time.<br /><br />While watching this movie, you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in ""Revenge of The Nerds"", and numerous other films of the same genre."
positive;Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost).
negative;The source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown.
negative;This doesn't sound like a mix or movie that should include Anupam Kher right?
negative;A lot of the film was shot in Columbia, CA, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Sonora, CA.
positive;The soundtrack by composer Prokiev and Eisentstein's direction are a sight and sound to behold Many years later, John Milius used many of the movies scenes, set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into Conan.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines from Conan was taken from this movie.
positive;And what makes the character of Joe even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that to him it's not only not bad, it's necessary.
negative;All of those movies had a little more than just plain sports.
positive;However, recently a friend let me borrow his Farscape DVDs, and I am just now realizing what a terrible mistake that was.
positive;It really got interesting there at the end and I really want to see where it is going from there.
negative;this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever.
positive;This is the funniest sequel I have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary.
positive;"This is a good movie; might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job, but I think that it's also that that improves the story."
positive;Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen, Briggs owned a pipe.
negative;Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played in Doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad.
negative;"Even so I'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made, second only to ""Nail Gun Massacre."""
positive;"If anything, ""Only the Valiant"" lives up to its Warner Brothers origins."
negative;Imagine my delight when not ONLY did the two main characters dance, but the main ghost began break dancing as well.
positive;Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes.
negative;Starships fire blobs of color at each other, flaring into stock explosions, and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers.
positive;Can you imagine him at 45-years old?<br /><br />Wise and witty, tender and brutal, poised, poignant, understated yet edgy, chilling and thrilling, mesmerizing, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, THE MASTERPIECE.
positive;One of the best movies ever, hands down.
negative;Pop a cash register on a saw-horse and bam!--instant hardware store.<br /><br />I'm usually pretty forgiving of low-budget horror films, but this one just begs for it.
negative;A country's movies must do more than just provide jobs.
negative;Something about how humanity is about to follow in its race's footsteps and destroy themselves by something they'll soon create.
positive;The music, well of course.
positive;<br /><br />Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie, like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end.
negative;I call it a turkey.
positive;But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense: It's every bit as dynamic, exuberant and larger-than-life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous Z-Boys themselves.
negative;In the 1960s, we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations.
positive;It doesn't matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug!
positive;'.<br /><br />Back in 1974, it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attach√© case full of documents marked 'Classified'.<br /><br />'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom, after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'Six Dates With Barker', the 'Doctor' series, and 'Hark At Barker'.<br /><br />Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!
positive;He was the master at that sort of dance, and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once.
negative;Especially if you love horrible movies.
negative;"I love most Jet Li movies (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap three-pack with ""The Master"" and ""Twin Warriors""."
positive;Rowan Atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time.<br /><br />The TV series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, BEAN and MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY.
positive;"Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer (three years later) to Elia Kazan's more conservative ""On The Waterfront."""
positive;Just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good.
positive;I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century.
negative;For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film.
negative;The film starts well enough.
positive;I was just lucky I found this movie.
negative;This was pretty inevitable.
positive;He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him.<br /><br />Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive.
positive;Another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer & subway security branch.
negative;Overall, if you're looking for late '80 schlock, I imagine you could do worse.
positive;I am glad that I then started watching.
negative;You had your zombies, your decent actors, and your story.
negative;the people behind this should be bought to justice asap.
positive;Enter Bluto, usually the exponent of wolf whistle and an on acceptable on-screen version of a Male reaction to feminine pulchritude.
positive;Despite the character she portrays.
negative;When he is discovered, he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from England.
positive;I haven't seen much of his work but I suspect that this isn't his best, even though it is very good.
negative;American broadcasts, that is, judging from their speech.
positive;The cast is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles by Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G.
positive;This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock.
positive;It almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen.
negative;He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused.
positive;A true tribute paid from one director to another.<br /><br />I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations.
positive;<br /><br />The focus of camera has been Meethi, portrayed by Konkona.
positive;It was an excellent show and let die way before it's time.
positive;The film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more.

positive;This film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country, yet one can only find it on obscure late-night TV, if ever at all.
positive;Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two pals, and make for a couple of very handsome officers, I must say.
negative;Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it.

negative;The limited scenery views were the only saving grace to an otherwise uneventful and boring movie.
positive;I look forward to seeing again .<br /><br />But you`ve got to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time ?

positive;Obviously fans will miss the gun-barrel trademark and the 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions.<br /><br />Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive.
positive;"""Black Water"" is truly a very well structured, unpredictable, thrilling, well directed, and well creepy movie."

negative;I still feel that Lauren Graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character, she seemed to steal the movie.
positive;Nelson is not a character that is easy to like - indeed he is a bit of a b**tard, a master manipulator who definitely places self-interest above all else.

positive;Heart-pounding tension, great pacing through editing, and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction.
positive;This influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day.
negative;But I did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it.
negative;To distribute a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple-minded guy... A cultural object is far more interesting when challenging, even when it is a foreign movie (being french in this case it's even worse!
negative;I swear Courtney was inebriated, on painkillers or both.
negative;Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil...he was more annoying then anything.
positive;This film has no loose ends, but runs just as a father's tale to his children would.
positive;While a great majority are merely flashy clips to advertise a popular performer's latest hit single, a precious few really do rise above the rest, becoming works of art in their own right {anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching}.
negative;I really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie, but this was so awful, I had to make an exception.<br /><br />I am a SciFi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on SciFi that I genuinely like.

negative;- The editing is sloppy and unimaginative.
negative;The graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing.<br /><br />And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical.<br /><br />My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie.<br /><br />Dutcher's God's Army One was okay.
negative;"You can't blame the actors... the story fails in far more ways than one.<br /><br />From the onset of the film, however, I was certain I was wrong, that no director/writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot ""twist."""

negative;The actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us scared of this killer or just scared of this movie.
positive;South Park has made history as being their first episode with the most cuss words, unless you count the movie as an episode.<br /><br />I enjoyed how they made fun of Chris Hansen and his television show, to Catch a Predator.

negative;"Well yes, David Hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that, it can't be easy when ""all around are losing theirs"" so to speak, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director ( if there was one) I just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor ( other than paying the bills, obviously) I can't begin to say how disappointed I am in them."

positive;The opening with that theme song was fantastic!!!
negative;This was such a terrible film, almost a comedy sketch of a noir film.The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still higher than most.But its where they've decided to cut costs that is totally weird.Some actors are at least competent, while others look like they just been dragged off the street.One of them being the lead actor, hes so very bad that i cringed when ever he said anything (he talks through the ENTIRE movie).Then there's the weird costume choices.At the start of the movie all characters are wearing 1930's clothes.They drive a classic car, but the background is a modern day windfarm thats blatantly state of the art.And the costumes and some settings continue to follow this 30's film noir theme.Then BAM in drives a brand new escalade with 24 inch rims....WTF.Same thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle, you get a shot down its sight.Hes aiming at a guy with an mp5 and tactical gear on.In a even stranger contrast the locations are brilliant, and seem to have cost more than the rest of the entire film.The camera shots/angles a very good, and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes.The director has a keen eye for a good looking single shot, but no idea how to do much else.<br /><br />People who should be shot for this film‚ñº<br /><br />The writer The director The casting agent The costume designer<br /><br />People who should be tortured to death for their monotone, monotonous nails on chalk board voice.‚ñº<br /><br />Anton Pardoe- the lead actor, writer, producer If you ever seen the movie Hostel, i wish that would happen to this guy, but he doesn't escape.
negative;Wow.
positive;Of course, going into it, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid T&A flick, and it is.
positive;My wife & I will never forget it.
positive;One of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl.
positive;It is violent, and most of the characters aren't meant for you to like them, but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look past the violence and the criminals and see them as real people.
positive;Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together -- as co-writer, co-producer, and in his best performance since From Russia With Love.
positive;It was not composed ( by Les Reed and Barry Mason, incidentally ) until 1968.<br /><br />Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of Peggy ( now a Yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp, jumping into the air and shouting ( what else? )
positive;At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting.

negative;First let me say I'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies, I love Tarkowsky movies for example, Berghman is also a favorite.....but this?
negative;Anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin (and I doubt most sane people would bother) will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore, loads of awful acting, and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise (if you've seen April Fool's Day, then you'll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed).<br /><br />Granny is uninspired, unexciting, and almost unwatchable.
negative;Have I seen a worse movie?
negative;I mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot.
negative;"The two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most spiteful, exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the MST3k classic ""the Brute Man."""
negative;It seems the screenwriters, unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation, fell back on lame set-ups for Don Adams famous lines, flashbacks to fat camp, references to Carell's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have, and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face.<br /><br />For those who have seen the original, the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories.
positive;).<br /><br />REBIRTH could have been cut out of this film all together.
positive;The film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet-talking con man, without making her selfish or demanding.
negative;The movie goes nowhere, following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates.<br /><br />Eventually things do pick up.

positive;The game is pretty much near-perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, convincing weapons, and great level design.
negative;<br /><br />Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message.
positive;So, it's up to either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day.<br /><br />This is certainly one of the better 1940s Westerns I have seen and it nearly garnered an 8--it was that good.

positive;He has such versatility, but he mainly stays in positive roles.
negative;They say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents, but he doesn't do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films.

positive;He passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist.<br /><br />Ridley can't remember anything, so Helen lets him take the blame for the death.

negative;I mean...Andy Milonakis?
negative;That is, it's bad.
positive;The story is a bit out there with the whole no-one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable, the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history.

negative;They manipulate many of the others, whack them as necessary, assume various poses, and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with unfailing success until just before the end.<br /><br />The lead actor here, like many in this channel's movies, is an old hand.
negative;So I came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst.
positive;I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough.
negative;But for your benefit I will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons.

negative;I don't doubt most of these people will never be heard from again, and it will be for good reason.
positive;hostage takers.
positive;When I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid,it scared the hell out of me.Probably because mannequins give me the creeps too.Jocelyn Jones(Molly)is an excellent actress.She uses her facial expressions,especially her eyes,at playing terrified.Chuck Connors is great as Mr.Slausen.I was happy to see him play such a different roll.The other actors in this movie are great too!
negative;At the wedding she meets his brother Jjaks.

negative;There is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and Stephen Balwin's character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again, the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead, then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit, a very obvious error in editing.

positive;It taps into everything awesome about rock and roll, the band comes up with some great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder etc).
negative;Granted, most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but I can usually live with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre.
negative;So when he receives a cell-phone message from Mike concerning how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were off at the beach taking in the sun and sand, Jack is frenzied with fear.
negative;Another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program, is Ben Miles, in the role of the sex-mad 'typical man' brother (once again, what an original character!).

negative;To quote a popular axiom, sometimes less is more.
negative;Coach Ramsey, who was part of a past hazing incident that went awry causing killer-scarecrow-mischief, has to confront some demons himself as he informs the survivors of the group about what they are up against.<br /><br />Babes, boobs, and blood..this flick follows the basic slasher guidelines.
positive;All great satire is based on going out on an edge.
negative;"Lynn Collins role of a ""stripper with a heart"" was well acted, but the character was simultaneously absurd and clich√©d, not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and Ribisi.<br /><br />Romantic?"
positive;It was a fiberglass deck with the Surfer Magazine logo screened on it.
negative;The predictability hardly ended with those characters.
negative;If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original?
positive;Although, this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Association, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season.<br /><br />This episode was funny and just shocking.
positive;They both need to get away.
negative;The acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p. It would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too, most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt) and quality cinematography.

positive;"But the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, not unlike the toe-tapping ""Hot Lunch Jam"" in the cafeteria."
negative;With this cast it could have been much better.
positive;But add in Bill Murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.<br /><br />It does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms.
negative;Yet, this flick also carries the typical slasher traits of corny characters, acting, dialogue and overall plot.
positive;But Kate Capshaw is absolutely beautiful, and she showed it in this movie.
negative;<br /><br />Great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together.
negative;Don't even rent it!
positive;After all these years of solving crimes, you would've expected criminals to know that they can't afford making mistakes with him, especially not with regards to talking much.
positive;This movie is one of the only historical documents displaying the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses, and dancers.
positive;Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out.
positive;Several moments make for some genuinely exciting suspense, successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films which it is parodying {though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula}.
positive;"This is one of those ""must be seen to be believed"" type things."
negative;A sickening example of how talent & originality is by-passed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity.
negative;The film had the greatest budget ever in Russian movie history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the Kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice, sweet nothing.
positive;"The video opens with a brief film-within-a-film, as Michael, on a quiet and brightly-lit night, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is ""different"" from other guys, transforming into a hideous werewolf as the nighttime clouds part to reveal a full moon."
negative;The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad.
positive;Although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parent's high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is WAY outdated)... and I admit that that was MY first impression.... but honestly,the 'lessons' that are learned by the heroes/heroines are def.
positive;I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now.<br /><br />Notice how the pie fights in The Three Stooges' HALFWITS' HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE resemble this one...and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures.

negative;Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for Sandra Lee), during their show.
negative;Whatever.
negative;This isn't a dreadful film, merely insipid.
positive;"Superb support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the clich√©e and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is far more talented than being simply ""the director's daughter"" would imply."
positive;"These qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.<br /><br />THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart drugs Day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence, involving what seems hundreds of cuts, are very powerful."
negative;They appear to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX??
negative;As the spoilt and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is darkly brooding and impetuous.
positive;Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack.
positive;Jason brought a lot of energy to the role, doing a lot of his own stunts, such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat, and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin, and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'Pink Panther' films.<br /><br />'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit.
negative;It's plain boring, which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be.
positive;The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie.
positive;See it!<br /><br />*** 1/2 out of ****
negative;If you watch the documentary extra, you'll note that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker bud of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store.
positive;In the third, the Spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous, plundering spree.<br /><br />Although a revisionist Western, the treatment of the Indian is problematic.
positive;It starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor.
negative;Otherwise, skip this nonsense.
negative;As for the actors, very poor choice.
positive;I really expected to see a lot of these stars in other television productions, but short of Mariska Hagartay who played Fisher Stephens crazy girlfriend, I've not seen many of them except in occasional cameo roles.
positive;This is well-done, with tight editing.
negative;Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their client√®le with the high concept dances that those girls were doing?
negative;A number of performances are noticeable , especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which Jonathan Kerrigan refers to as his face.
negative;Then the boredom kicked in.
negative;"Even such B-illuminaries as Dick Sargent(""Bewitched"" tv series, ""Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes), Keenan Wynn(""Dr. Strangelove"", ""The Dark"", ""Laserblast""), and Peter Graves(""Beginning of the End"", ""Killers from Space"", ""It Conquered the World"")provide only the moost tepid performances."
positive;He (a muted Saarsgard) is aide de camp to a Senator (Alda) and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job isn't worth uncovering the truth.
positive;As in 'Panic in the Streets,' an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency, particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect.<br /><br />'The Killer That Stalked New York,' for the most part, manages to sidestep its low production budget.
positive;Plus, Lauren Holly looks hot in a naval uniform.
positive;This man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done.
negative;"""Venom"" is not this movie.<br /><br />There is almost no character development at all."
negative;I felt underestimated.

positive;Many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort.
positive;Then one day, out of sheer curiosity, i bought the cd and fell in love with it.
negative;The best part of the movie are the end credits.
positive;I remember how sad I was at the ending and it really came as a shock.
negative;It would've been lovely to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role.
positive;I think it does need to be released in DVD before I wear my VHS version out.
positive;1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there.
positive;Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter.
positive;Born Bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids.
positive;"I don't like Perks."""
negative;Where's the common sense?
positive;The special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old.
positive;However they are not alone in the wild.
negative;This one is better.
negative;Maybe that's one reason why Colony Pictures didn't last very long.
negative;Oh, he is enough to melt the heart.
positive;They just don't make shows like this anymore (I know that makes me sound really old), and it blows my mind that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something cool to watch.
positive;shows of their own now--it's easy to see why.
positive;There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy's THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films...remember, at that time, they all stole from the best, each other!!!
positive;The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that its fun.
positive;Hickman's look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect.
negative;The book wasn't what I expected to it to be, and the movie disappointed me even further.
negative;YUK!!!
positive;One of her best performances ever.
negative;It is at best confusing and absurd.
negative;Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller(Meg Ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.<br /><br />The film begins promisingly in black and white, as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the Huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, its only a question of how bad?
positive;I remember ignoring the TV series when it first debuted because of its 'look' with the Jim Hensen muppets.
positive;That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience in to her grief, dejection, and slim glimmer of hope.
positive;it was racer-x's mystery persona and how the world of speed racer pretty much 'happened' to revolve around it.
negative;Of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually OK.<br /><br />Yes, that is the story...and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted, abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters.
negative;Well as a congressman he is to partner for a bill proposed by John Goodman's character when suddenly God appears to tell Evan to build an ark.
negative;Not FREELY available, however, as HBO charges for such garbage.
negative;This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got its hands on it, taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior.<br /><br />As G4's ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic hormone-driven young men, adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment.
negative;The saving grace was really the background music, which made it OK to laugh at the film, instead of with the film, or not at all.
positive;This, in itself, didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail.
negative;Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes -- Alzar, Terris, Ikron.
negative;"I noticed that another film in which he starred was titled ""The Perfect Neighbor."
negative;Are they kidding?
negative;The idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched, but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept.
negative;The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990).<br /><br />Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films.
negative;I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie.
negative;"It's not ""Only Angels Have Wings"" and it's not ""M*A*S*H."" It's an uneasy mixture of the two that unfortunately comes across as more silly than funny.<br /><br />It aims at shock, amusement, and education, but doesn't really achieve its goals.<br /><br />As far as its shock value is concerned, well, we're inured by now, aren't we?"
positive;Without researching the actual locations, I'm assuming it was shot somewhere in Africa, both coastal and desert, a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man, infant civilization, infant life on earth.
positive;The only reason I do not have the complete set is because I purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set.
positive;Heck, in the heyday of his career in the 1930s, he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or some other dreck and still made it entertaining and likable due to his charming persona.
negative;The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, whom I thought might be there as a plot device/eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance.
positive;I had a GT (GrenTech) plastic board with Power Paw urethane wheels (loose bearings).<br /><br />My parents told me we were moving to California later that year and that they were taking a trip to go house-hunting.
positive;"Unfortunately, the murder committed is done for real, and while Wood and Homer think it's all fake (after discovering Ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer.<br /><br />As expected, Charles Belden's screenplay for ""The Ghost Walks"" features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time, as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting, the obligatory group of suspects, and the touch of comedy."
positive;They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her.
positive;Why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment?
negative;"Not the case here.<br /><br />Whether the referenced miscreant might be the ""neighbor,"" or as in this offering, ""the wife,"" it is always fascinating how easily, successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their dastardly deeds."
negative;I had great expectations for it and was disappointed.
positive;His parody of Hitler is brilliant.
negative;Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what?
negative;The first problem was that they did that irrelevant, scenario of history repeating itself (Jr having a kid like his parents did).
negative;<br /><br />Enjoy it for the sheer masochistic thrill!
positive;because no actor before or since has put so much into his movies.
positive;Their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness Everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way.
positive;The film actually helps in dispelling a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder.
positive;Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman.
negative;The old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it to her.
positive;"Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful."
negative;"The company that made this thing just spliced CGI footage from the first Octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in ""Bride of the Monster"" look like a masterpiece of special effect footage."
negative;No bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no chips placed in the brain, but they use headsets borrowed from a telemarketing agency that went out of business in 1983(Nice job Set director on this one.
positive;OK..you people need to settle down!
negative;Men In Trees is a complete knock-off of Northern Exposure.
negative;What serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at Alex's lame cheerleader routine?
positive;The humour, the fate, the sorrow is so clean - so simple - so touching.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece.
negative;Known in the U.S. as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY, this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog.
negative;The Japanese coast line must be vast.
negative;For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I didn't recognize) was the best of the lot.
negative;In 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called The Island...I personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie.
positive;"Only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film ""Edge of the City"" ends up being.<br /><br />What's most disturbing about this lost classic: how it sadly remains unavailable on any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy."
negative;And that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film-making.
positive;JPJ is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this DVD is how well the four of them perform together.
positive;Each of these subplots pulls together at the end, creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved.<br /><br />There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production: the musical score by Bramwell Tovey is performed by the Vancouver Symphony members, the cinematography by Kevin Van Niekerk is aptly atmospheric, and the general quality of acting by this Canadian cast is very fine.
positive;<br /><br />Yet despite this implied message, Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn, and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome.
positive;Beautifully shot.
negative;Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain.
negative;"The ""Fangoria"" level of gross-out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore-hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side.<br /><br />The Broken Skull is also an extremely noisy movie."
positive;When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system, and broadcast his plans to capture them!
positive;This is a good place to start.
negative;A perfunctory thriller plot (which is there merely to string the club sequences together), variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script, all stop Sorted from being the showcase that director Jovy obviously intended.<br /><br />However, although Jovy is sometimes over indulgent (especially when using the often ill-fitting dance music) he does show potential, and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing.
positive;We had just bid farewell to a decade, and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years.
negative;hee-heeew!
positive;Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life.
negative;You want contemporary feel, watch anything by John Dahl.
negative;Matthew MacFadeyn's portrayal of Darcy is flat.
negative;The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie.
positive;The CGI trains are horribly obvious--even more so than the Anastasia train.<br /><br />8/10
negative;the ghost is a black haired girl, that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead.. the difference is just the motive for the haunting.
positive;I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence.
positive;Any other incident would have sufficed just as well, I feel.
positive;In my opinion, we ought to be much obliged to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic TV westerns and SASS around him to perform in a new western such as this.
negative;I don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine so..my advice is watch the movie first..see if u like it and after vote(do not vote before you watch it ! )
positive;Second, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, SERIOUS problems develop when McKinley is assassinated and Taylor is on death row for the crimes!!!
negative;The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description.
negative;Oh!
positive;Later, as Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (nicely playing Lemmon's friend/colleague, caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the plant' s control room, they're obviously running a boiling-water plant (built by GE.)
negative;Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.<br /><br />What a shame it is then to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX.
positive;<br /><br />`The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft).
negative;and is followed by the judge Carne.
positive;She has done a good turn, not only to the general public, but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psycho-analysts.
negative;Recommended for fans of Ms. Moore and Mr. Cooper
positive;Despite how nasty Crawford seems, Lange is determined not to give in--to make it in this job.
positive;Or they are trying to tell a predictable story.
positive;The documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point.
negative;"Well, 1st off I haven't seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" yet.... but, I think that I would have become sick if I would have seen it before this piece."
negative;But it's worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, ego-maniacal, fading actress.
positive;Impossible ones, at times?
positive;<br /><br />But there's an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end.
positive;I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother.
negative;BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge.
positive;Although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself doesn't have them including the autumn characters (mother and daughter) the general concept rocks.
positive;What she finds out stuns the entire community.
positive;If you watch this movie you'll be quoting it and referring to it for a long time to come.
positive;Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.
positive;Years and decades later, some look back on it with fondness, others with embarrassment.
negative;Too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think.
negative;"Lombard and Bellamy are largely believable and likable; MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length."
positive;'Hi-De-Hi!'.
negative;and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him.............
positive;Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure, all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems.
positive;The music of the Horseflies is very unique and adds an eerie quality to some of the scenes.
positive;Faults do pop up in the story, as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful.
positive;It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.<br /><br />Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting).
negative;Not funny,<br /><br />just a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on a very very funny original.
positive;To the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the Muslim faith here.
negative;I consider it more of a warning.
negative;On the positive side, they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.<br /><br />Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age.
positive;It certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists, but it's immensely engaging and fun.
negative;The plot is a simple one, and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible.
positive;The original series, aka classic series, was made fun of by the bad special effects and/or wobbly sets.
positive;For the people who are open and loves movies like this, give it a try, you might like it.
negative;!<br /><br />
negative;In a word... BAH!
positive;NOT outdated.
positive;It's one of my favorites TV series.
negative;"It was that, another thrilling episode of ""Ironsides"" or ""Password."
positive;We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong.
negative;You rarely get to see the creature, and the main actor (who also happens to be the director, screen writer, editor, and producer!)
negative;That's one of several ST plot-devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence.
negative;Even the soundtrack is awful!
negative;The dialog is the worst I've ever heard.
negative;Scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done.
positive;She is not someone to be worshiped or idolized, because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws, who possessed incredible talent as a writer, and who died at age 15 from typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
negative;"Weber's lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy, as are his ramblings about famous (and not so famous) people he's known, as he tries to complete Johnson's ""education."""
negative;She looked very healthy.
negative;<br /><br />It sucked.<br /><br />I returned the video after watching half of it.
negative;Was that harsh?
positive;But when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak, for it is actually very deep.
positive;This is a film for those who are sick & tired of mindless escapism from Hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn (not that I have any burning issues with popcorn,mind you!---I actually love the stuff).
negative;But if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks, this is one for you.
positive;Yes the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet shows.
negative;Some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter?
negative;However, this was a massive disappointment.
positive;Terence Rattigan deserves an A+ for his update of the James Hilton story.
negative;"Ha ha ha, it's just a story"" routine dragged out for a while."
positive;There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact.
positive;regardless of whether or not some people were not Chris Farley fans i saw this film when it came out and my friends and i still talk about it... 11 years later.
negative;Enough said really.<br /><br />Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot.
positive;Alright, Here on Earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye.
positive;The film's most touching moment comes when Jim and Leila discover that they are standing under the mistletoe, and Jim talks of what he has lost.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching.
positive;This kind of crud has to be stopped.
positive;The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples kisses, people yelling to one another, and more, all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through.
negative;Sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very cocky.
positive;Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience.
positive;It doesn't have any big special effects, but so what?
negative;"This stupidity is witnessed again when ""Stan"" goes to save subway 4."
negative;But now?
positive;As a prove of his love for her, he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her.
negative;Ditto for directing and acting.
positive;I am so very glad that i exist in this 'our time'.
negative;"They also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome, usually saying things like, ""Hello?"
positive;I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).
positive;It was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject.
positive;<br /><br />Let's start with the good things!
positive;"After having lost his job, he works as a fruit-merchant with little income, going from backyard to backyard ""crying out"" his produce."
negative;"The way Cooper kept shouting ""Alvin!"
negative;the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed.
positive;Anything and Everything DOES happen there!
positive;I liked it, anyway.
negative;"While Twin Warriors was very impressive and I was thoroughly intrigued by it, and the master was a bit ""Karate Kid"" but also enjoyable, I thought this movie was TERRIBLE."
positive;"""The Falcon and the Snowman"" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who become disenchanted with United States foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union."
negative;Unfortunately, we then meet or main characters.
positive;Jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end.
negative;It has none of the depth of, say, Aldomovar's Talk to Her, which I loved.
positive;O'Connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with Sakall is very charming.<br /><br />It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed.
positive;They're all alone together.
positive;The way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability.
negative;Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is.
positive;Jane's and Aaron's trip to Central America.
negative;Joan Allen was also wonderful, however her character was much watered down from Whartons novella.<br /><br />I do not expect films to faithfully portray novels, but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed.
negative;The write up gave the impression of a cliff hanger end..sorry, I wasn't impressed.
negative;Returning to the beach to confront Mike because of his negligence(..not to mention Jack's promise to coach Ramsey, played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, regarding no hazing), Jack and Beth will face the same straw-stuffed assassin that is bumping off the others.
negative;Won't happen.
positive;A thousand of twists in the script, and a story where nothing's like it seems.<br /><br />The weak points in latest Bardem's movie may be the so-American language, that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural (especially Victoria Abril's.
negative;Okay, enough.
positive;Shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life.
negative;Or Society.
negative;It didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end.
positive;In terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested.
positive;"this is a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid 1970's.based how much on truth it's hard to tell.this much is certain.it is based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman.anyway,the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath,including the arrest of a suspect,some 25 years after,who was never considered a suspect at the time.in the movie,Fuhram of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for Martha's surviving family,in particular her mother.the narrative of the film is by the ghost of Martha Moxley,talking in the first person.this is a very effective device in this movie.to me,it adds more impact to the movie,and puts a human face on the murder victim(if only an actress playing the part)Maggie grace plays Martha,and i was really impressed with her.there is no way for certain to know Mark Fuhrman's motive in investigating the crime.it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared.or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future bestselling book.either way,it makes for an interesting movie.it's well acted and fairly fast paced.i don't think there was a lot of extra,unnecessary stuff in the movie,just what was needed to tell the story.one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings,and one would be right.also,one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right.but,as i said,for me,i think they told the story with at least most of the essentials.anything else would have likely required a miniseries.as an aside,there is a miniseries entitled ""A Season in Purgatory"" which came out 6 years ealier(1996)which this movie has some parallels to,even if only faint.however,if you like this movie,""Then you may be interested in ""A Season in Purgatory""."
positive;A case in point is the part where she's distressed at the scene, shown on TV, of Saddam Hussein's arrest.
negative;I'm glad I watched it, it was worth the wait
positive;Where does Meethi disappear to?
negative;Then there's Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother???!!!
positive;He just misses his streetcar trying to give a man a light.
negative;"Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go ""in the closet""."
negative;Why should we have to hint about these things?
negative;I hope they make a REAL Noah movie someday, one done seriously and thoughtfully, one that actually appeals to people and makes money.
positive;With her help, there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these DVDs'.
positive;<br /><br />Deborah Benson makes for a great lead, her presence was captivating.
negative;The script is simply non existent.
negative;It's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico.<br /><br />The other thing I really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after Germany surrenders.
positive;I had no idea what to think.
positive;Wentzle Ruml.
negative;It's hard to imagine this film followed Get Carter.
negative;My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating).
negative;He was not seen gambling.
negative;It seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through.
positive;This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the Spanish government for the right to end his life.
positive;But perhaps not as you know it.
negative;"It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like.<br /><br />Again the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in Australia';s history the film it deserved."
positive;The films intensity rests in Bergman's keeping our focus on the minute, intimate relations of his two characters - both accomplished musicians - trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand.
negative;The script was silly.
positive;Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody.
positive;Why not speculate?
negative;The thing is.. .It has no soul and no originality.
negative;I was expecting a Biblical story visualized with great special fx, etc.
negative;Now that i am 24 i watched it again, and i wished i hadn't.
negative;"""Ray"" is played by Rick Cramer.<br /><br />I could continue, but I think you get the picture."
positive;No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twists¬Öjust straight to the point mystery.
positive;Don't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious, art house flick.
positive;"Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to keep making films, and ""The Ghost Walks"" was one of his best.<br /><br />In ""The Ghost Walks"", John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play."
negative;The violence was pretty good.
positive;Strong story.
negative;At the start, the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards, and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a telephone call - only to discover the line has been cut.<br /><br />Shortly afterwards, Roy Scheider as one of the witness's assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and his wife - upon which the Roy Scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number, and then speaks: It is done!!!!
negative;It just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition.
negative;If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you.
positive;This is an effective Holmes story, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England.
negative;A stellar cast indeed!!
positive;That's a given.
negative;The only reason this got a four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer FINALLY comes out) is actually exciting.<br /><br />4/10
positive;"This should ensure that the policy remains effective."""
positive;A fun filled romp, full of silly if not sometimes cruel jokes.
negative;The movie audience, though, has gained sophistication in 30 years.
positive;Cmon-what kid watching this, wouldn't be able to relate to SOMEONE in the movie?
positive;Best check with them.
positive;The mystery at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents.
positive;"Another good movie is called ""DISASTERPIECES"" which shows the band's performance at the London Arena."
negative;They screwed with the story.
positive;The pacing is a little too slow at times, but Strayer knew that the power of his film was on Belden's script and makes the most of it, letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results.
positive;Also,keep an open mind.
negative;This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink.
negative;There are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is.
negative;"The last time I was this stunned at how un-funny a comedy can be was with the awful ""Big Momma's House."""
negative;Seriously, who the hell directed this?
positive;"Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fianc√©e or the wife of the ""in-film director"" (Evan Richards)."
negative;This story falls completely flat in this area.
negative;), Stella Stevens pops up, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how bad they needed the work.<br /><br />And special mention, of course, for our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor Blair.
negative;Too unreal.
negative;Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy.
negative;This is the case here except they aren't scary.
negative;If you say so.
positive;"And, it also resulted in two ""firsts"" for me.<br /><br />I watched the film, the first time, and I was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that's only happened to me three times before."
negative;<br /><br />Grade: 3 out of 10.
positive;Although acceptable, they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing.
positive;Now that his latest venture in Africa has failed, he's on his way home to England.
positive;along with good acting, good story, hilarious moments, serious scenes that at times brought me to tears.
positive;The quote by Nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film.
negative;"Last week on Friday, I went to see ""Snakes on a Plane"" with my friends."
negative;More's the pity, because the acting is fine, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas.
negative;"and ""Chokeslam!"""
negative;"In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was ""completely out of tune"" with the book."
negative;Being a non entry-level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance.<br /><br />What was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park?
negative;Basics conveniences to the screenplay seems to work.
positive;I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me.
positive;I truly loved this film and can't wait to see more of Matthew George's work.
positive;The movie plays like the final Act of Richard III.
positive;It was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later.
positive;Aswell as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are A-class.
negative;Oh, and he's a racist.
negative;The movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his house) and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set.
positive;I'm not the type of person to watch T.V.
positive;<br /><br />So, to no one who's barely or even never heard of this program, here's a general note: think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett met up with Walt Disney and decided to go to slum part of Vegas with a free mini-bar and make a collaboration in the vein of Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons combined.
positive;Each character seemed to fit their part to a tee.
positive;"""Incautos"" has been quite a surprise: it's a serious film, with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining.<br /><br />The art of robbing, that's what ""Incautos"" is about."
negative;This movie also known as SUMMER LOVE has a haunting theme song sung by John Davidson.
negative;What is interesting and keep me watching, to some extent, was the production values.
negative;If these people could get their movie made and released on DVD then anyone can!<br /><br />0/10-- Save your money.
negative;The music and 8mm footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random.
negative;and exists now as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week.<br /><br />What looks to be a fancy sci-fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re-run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different 'trips' back in time where a major company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles.
positive;This one is no different.
positive;"""And, gentlemen, George died last New Year's Eve!"""
negative;"Why didn't they just call it ""Border patrol""?"
positive;I promptly checked the play out of Library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording.
positive;In OVER 21, the pair play husband and wife.
positive;I strongly recommend it.
positive;A gift to everyone of middle age whose spent time seems both full and yet empty: there is more around the next bend and it can be great, enriching, and romantic.
positive;This is a good balance of telling you an interesting story, without drawing it out too long or leaving you unsatisfied.
positive;Her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that magnitude.
positive;This Gregory Peck cavalry versus the Indians oater is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor.
positive;And if you disagree - watch the DVD.
negative;In one scene, for example, the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens.
positive;I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.
negative;girlfriend?
positive;Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet *real* for me.
negative;Hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly, but a pathetic suck-up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time.
positive;I viewed this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a couple of days ago.
negative;I finally rented this video after searching for it for many months.
negative;What could have roughly translated into Japanese equivalent of an early David Lynch piece, instead wares out it's spiraled gimmickry before it even has a chance to explain itself- which of course it does not.
positive;So he starts to feel more and more superfluous, gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive.
positive;I could watch this movie dozens of times!
negative;Hollow acting by Donnelly doesn't help, but fits right in with the rest of the cast.
negative;So you're a giant mantis and you've been hanging out in the arctic for a while, and you're tired of Eskimos hitting you with snowballs.
positive;he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage.
negative;"This has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci-fi moovies accowmplished, namely ""WestWorld"" and ""Logan's Run""."
positive;The first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst Indian women.
negative;I don't recommend you watching this movie if you are easily offended.
positive;He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness--women.
positive;"Poetic license, perhaps, as this is not in the script, but we can forgive Miss Dressler's excesses; she is too good at it not to."
negative;Rather in a farcical way.
negative;However, this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between East and West.
negative;This movie is highly improbable.
positive;Does Aunt Ruth really exist?
positive;I have seen this movie, just once, and I'm looking forward to see it again and again.
negative;In two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of Nazi spies in World War II.
positive;the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it.
positive;Clearly, Cathy wants Lance.
negative;Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome, there are much better films and miniseries around.
negative;Let's see: what are the advantages to watching Piranha, Piranha?
negative;There are reasons to watch however, with the scenery of the Isle of Wight certainly providing a beautiful setting, and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks.
negative;Don't make more movies!
positive;Eastwood plays Cpl.
positive;An old hangar is used as film location.
negative;It does have one use: A Cure For Insomniacs!!!!
positive;Oh hold on , I`ve just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley , Brad Pitt playing Pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc.
negative;"Michel Legrand comes up with some catchy tunes, but they merely inspire lyricist Don Black to the likes of ""One simple fact remains/No-one here suffers from growing pains.'"
negative;"""With its production, Hayakawa intended to provide a different view of Japanese culture to American audiences, avoiding the stereotyping, violence, and melodramatic conflict expected in 'Oriental' films of the period."""
negative;This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
negative;The gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance.
positive;This is all good.
positive;every single person i have watched this movie with now owns their own copy or longs to... A+++++ and ++
positive;You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.
negative;Lenzi then went out and executed his films the same way that a guy at McDonald's fixes a batch of French Fries.
negative;Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them is a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being.
negative;God knows how many really talented (black) directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them.
positive;"(Is that where ""yahoo"" came from?)"
positive;Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you, albeit a bit boringly, what life is like outside your world.
positive;Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a happy-go-lucky young man, and idealist, doing what he believes is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark, staying home due to his talented piano skills, or maybe just to steal his cousin's love.
positive;Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.
positive;the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit suburb.
negative;Luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic, talented actor - one of the big ones of the younger generation.
positive;In many ways the film is international than American.
negative;It leaves one wanting to see more of it, even though the story has a resolution.<br /><br />Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord¬Ö What can I say here?
negative;If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious.
positive;I went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for Robin Williams, but when I saw it I realized I had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy, although it has a few really good laughs in it.
negative;"The only reason I won't rate it a ""1"" is that the added footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie."
negative;As with most viewers of this film, I'm an avid reader of the books.
positive;His early attempt to flee Venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay.<br /><br />Complimenting the captivating character interaction, Visconti's powerful scenery (especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon) renders this film a true masterpiece.
positive;I've only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show.
positive;but none of them can stand up to GE007.
negative;The Christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters.
positive;It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story.
negative;I deliberately tortured myself.
positive;Beavis and Butthead was most popular with teen-aged boys, the very people at which it incessantly poked fun.<br /><br />With that in mind, I don't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent.
negative;"It becomes very apparent early on in this ""feature"" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion."
negative;"But (and you could tell there was a ""but"" coming) it's a failure of a film."
positive;And, naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process.<br /><br />Stroud isn't about to let Slaughter get away with this and kidnaps Slaughter's girlfriend.
positive;It is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will certainly find this film both entertaining and meaningful at the same time.
positive;Oh, also, heavy on the swearing, but once again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers.<br /><br />Was this movie called 'intelliocracy'?
negative;In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!!
negative;Less is more, but more from this team is absolutely pap.<br /><br />Zombies are rubbish as well.
negative;"I was half-expecting to hear ""the plaaain!"
negative;A predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen.
positive;Very hard sexual/sexually violent/gory imagery is presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who will be offended by sacrilege.<br /><br />Subconscious Cruelty is one of the best films I've seen under the banner of extreme horror it will be a very divisive film amongst horror fans and the filmgoing public in general.
negative;So we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, whereas some are not.
negative;Unfortunately, for them they took the easy route, both in the writing and (for the most part) in the casting.
positive;There is, as many reviews have observed, a strong dark streak to this movie.
negative;If you must see it.. wait and save the $3.50 - $4.00 and get it on video.
negative;Lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them.
positive;But if you have a deep interest in sea life, this repetition shouldn't become a problem for you at all.
negative;The flick shows signs of it's low budget particularly in the violence as most of the real action takes place off-screen instead of showing it happening up, close & personal.
positive;The focus of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow--the two are in every scene.
positive;"It was inspired by the film ""Enemy Below"" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II."
positive;"Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman put together a fine film, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated.<br /><br />If, however, you would rather see James Bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in another tiresome struggle with ""Jaws"", jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chase through San Francisco, this is NOT the film for you!"
positive;It also made me buy and be thrilled by the book, discover a fantastic author I hadn't read before, and listen again and again to Schubert - so, my thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle!!!
negative;I don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit.
negative;At least Plan 9 didn't have an agenda.
negative;The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray.
negative;"This isn't art, it's entertainment.<br /><br />Take this movie, ""Flight to Mars."""
positive;The magic (notice I say this a lot), is that this DVD captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are actually playing.
negative;It's a crying shame they threw in Tolstoy here.
positive;But the film is full of good points.
negative;it had absolutely no redeeming qualities.
positive;Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure(which is successful).
negative;"""<br /><br />rating: the movie itself-1 The MST3K version: 10"
negative;The Worst acting ever.These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema.
negative;There are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.<br /><br />The performances were also quite the embarrassment.
positive;(cheats, Aztec, Egyptian, god knows how many Multiplayer charries, and the three difficulties as well as the famous '007' difficulty Our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you.
negative;I hated this film.
negative;But this is film making by numbers, a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is 'success' - a film which patronises and despises the audience.
negative;We get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily... a french hairy version of Van Damme who just can't fight, act or speak to save his freaking life and Bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor who I was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish.
negative;The Belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning French children's TV, but Peter Hunt's film is not nearly as bad as it sounds ¬ñ the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to Max and Dave Fleischer's 1939 version while a couple of moments of Swiftian satire do remain - although it's definitely aimed at the youngest of children.
negative;2/10
negative;"But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair, fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career, they pay off the guy who sent the pictures, the diplomat freaks out and ""kills"" the guy, leading into a murder case."
negative;And there's no plot at all.<br /><br />Moreover, this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?
positive;I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth.
negative;In an acting stretch for him, Norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie.
positive;This film suggests a satisfying compromise between Science and Religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides.
positive;Lemmon starts to investigate and finds out the company cares more about profit then safety at the plant.
positive;Naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious Carlos the Jackal, and gets a little too caught up in the role.
positive;It gets a very high rating from viewers.
negative;This film focuses only on the love story, thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel.<br /><br />There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film.
negative;Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director.
positive;Not just thrown in gratuitously.
positive;"The problem is that, as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too much of a na√Øve ""boy scout"" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character."
positive;It manages to make the characters sympathetic (well, most of them) concerning the problems they have with their relationship.<br /><br />Gloria Swanson, as Leila, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence (though he does notice her absence).
positive;On top of that the directing is wonderful and the settings sumptuous and rich, a real treat.
positive;In any case Mehta's film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
negative;"If you need a clue as to whether Playmaker is decent or not, look to its star, Colin Firth, who refers to it in an interview as ""absolute rubbish -- I sincerely hope no one ever sees it."
negative;Lousy gags, bad music, poor drawings and animation...<br /><br />Regarding the impressive number of animators and intervallists on this picture (from, hum... a hundred different studios throughout the world?
negative;Palming, marked cards, etc.
positive;<br /><br />So maybe it's a bit far fetched... but it gives you a lighthearted sense of innocence... and a renewed faith in love.
positive;Goodnight campers!
positive;Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on, he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol.
negative;In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic.
positive;"Whereas ""Earth"" was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence, Fire and Water are pointing at personal, social and religious issues, which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away."
negative;"If you don't believe me, check this out: ""Alien from L.A."" actually depends on her to act throughout 9/10 of the movie!"
positive;Here, Kohut learns (?)
positive;For those who only remember him for the decaying actor 'Larry Renault' in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or the ham in THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940) this will be a revelation.
positive;All scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out, and suit this type of game perfectly.
positive;Have just seen this film, in Australia on satellite.
positive;When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst.
positive;Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year.
negative;Supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes.
positive;This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless.
negative;Most critics have written devastating about that Michalkov-movie, but I wanted it to see myself.
negative;"I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before he killed a victim."
positive;If you recall, Giant Robot had a particular way of shooting his missiles and my cousin had it down cold.
positive;We are helpless against governmental wrong-doings.
negative;"The fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad ""Scarface"" impersonation."
positive;Shows us something I had not seen since his last film.
positive;the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me.
positive;Ridley arrives back in town, and, believing he's not going to be at a party, Helen decides not to attend.
negative;"However, as ""An American Werewolf"" movie this one is a missed chance!"
negative;Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow.
negative;One of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others.
positive;If I start listing my favourite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie.<br /><br />The movie boasts of some stellar performances.
positive;Anyway, I recommend this to all people who don't need outer-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold.
positive;I don't need to say much about how good this documentary is--it's truly an amazing piece of true narrative.
negative;BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.<br /><br />2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area?
positive;Wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time.
positive;The supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way.
positive;Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces?
negative;"Regarding ""Burnt By The Sun"" by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie, one of the best I ever seen in my entire life, I was totally disappointed by that one."
positive;This movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the stunning photography and acting, the kolossal-like scenes of battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people).
positive;The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers.
negative;For some reason, the most interesting character, played by Rampling, is sidelined, whereas, regardless of the book, she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie (which would have been dull anyway, but at least we'd have got more of something pretty to look at).<br /><br />All in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how action-less an action movie can be.
positive;A similar fate befell Jason's next major show: 1976's 'Lucky Feller'.
positive;I finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store.
positive;Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision.
positive;All performances were strong, directing and cinematography...go watch it!
negative;Regardless, I am a rather open-minded individual when it comes to movies so I thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on carnivorous vines.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of clich√© and lack of any originality.
negative;10) The flood 11) The lad who wakes up on his floor to find that every item of furniture has be taken from his room.<br /><br />And if I can come up with that list in 5 minutes and from real life, I'm sure a couple of script writers can do better, a lot better.<br /><br />And for a film named after a Sleeper song, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
positive;I give it a 10.
positive;The only negative I noticed was that while having MacMahon play this nasty boss, at the end, he simply folded--and way too quickly.
positive;The climactic stand-off is more like an Arthurian joust.
positive;It deals with relationship failure, and at the same time making a joke of it.
negative;On his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and I don't believe he got hit a single time during the movie.
negative;This movie goes out of its way to throw every tasteless sick joke it can think of and rub your face in it.
positive;I think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well, and I respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner, aided by a thoroughly excellent Carl Crew as Dahmer.
positive;After seeing the 1960 color version on VHS, I kept saying I remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before.
negative;Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion.
positive;I have the whole complete set of 65 episodes on DVD-r but it's not the same because if they were released on DVD the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the DVD's in almost every store which means a lot to the fans.
positive;Check it out and you'll be amazed.
positive;The 'Silent Film' is a art-form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage, it can stands on it's own merits.<br /><br />THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictionalized history of the relationship of French Poet 'Francois Villon' and 'King Louis XI'.
positive;"John Travolta was excellent as ""Michael"" in the movie by the same name."
positive;All in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented, and there are no solutions.
negative;Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.
negative;Not to mention an obese, blue seductress Uhura, her fat legs and ass hanging out of some sort of insane bird costume, in this Method Acting Mess.
positive;Must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.
positive;Heartstopping.
negative;This film is something Anna Nicole Smith would take part in.<br /><br />I would tell you what the plot was, but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article, plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway, so I barely paid attention.
negative;Also, the inside of the building --- the newsroom --- the stairways --- seem much bigger than the outside.
negative;Lots of juvenile bathroom-humor, drawn out into painful tedium.
negative;She laughs at her own lame comments, mugs too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks.
positive;I find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie!
negative;Actually this is a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram movie.
positive;All are excellent here, particularly Harris and Gabor in the leads.
negative;There's only two deaths in the film(if you don't counted the roasted parrot..err..alien blood beast being offed at the end of the film).
positive;<br /><br />WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!
negative;At least that's the way I approached this film.
negative;today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child.
positive;When Kanin joined the military during WWII, Gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film.<br /><br />By the way, I noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it.
positive;"Much like ""The Outsiders"" where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio, and others can be found."
negative;Besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all.
positive;Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch throughout, but some deserve singling out.
positive;Furthermore, this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference, be it sexuality, culture and the way of life.
negative;OK, maybe the ending isn't as predictable, but is it any good?
negative;<br /><br />This film is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist clap trap that women are the clever, mindful, caring and clearly able leaders whilst men are good for nothing except physical bravery, mindless strength and very specialist knowledge.
negative;"But hey, he delivered them flawlessly!<br /><br />If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"""
negative;This movie is pretty predictable nuff said....from the delayed kissing scene to the inevitable coming around of grandpa...this is a great movie for the 10-12 age group but beyond that it has no market..i give it 4/10 only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more.
negative;This film shows no Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten.
negative;This one is more of a mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a Jim Jones like suicide cult -- the cannibals seem like they were added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the film.
negative;***SPOILERS*** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens, Julie Strain.
negative;"If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream ""fun night at the movies!"""
positive;It was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release.
negative;After 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes.
negative;the gunfights that were so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous, .2.
positive;Ronald Colman plays a prodigal son.
negative;If that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money!
negative;It's been said if you were to take Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, wrap them into one person, Ed Gein would still be sicker/scarier.
positive;Ms. Durbin's operatic voice blends well with Ms. Garland's natural one creating a lovely duet.<br /><br />Don't miss it whenever it shows on TCM!
positive;The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.
positive;"Such then is the heart of this movie called ""The Spirit of St."
positive;I highly recommend it to anyone.
negative;See the sights, maybe catch a show on Broadway.
positive;Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.
negative;"The ""monk"" character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life; nothing scary there either."
negative;He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him.
negative;I'm not a big fan of musicals, although this technically might not qualify as a musical.
positive;It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals.
negative;I'm not usually this critical, but this annoyed me.
positive;Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool.
negative;The episodes play out monotonously.
positive;"The run of mid-to-late fifties Hitchcock films (including ""Rear Window"", ""Dial M For Murder"", ""Vertigo"", and ""To Catch A Thief"", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career."
negative;Pathetic rubbish.
positive;<br /><br />Rendition is directed by Hollywood newbie Gavin Hood (who is set to do X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and begs the question of whether such 'extraordinary rendition' is exercised in real life.
positive;Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful!
positive;"All y'all hatin' on the fact you'd probably neva make the cut for ""Second String"" need to save it."
negative;The plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway?
negative;Leslie Nielson is a very talented actor, who made a huge mistake by doing this film.
negative;Its this chemistry that compells the story of Tarzan.
negative;Filled to the brim with clich√©'s and just plan dumb storytelling.
positive;I sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute.
negative;McDonalds and Burger King probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this.<br /><br />The worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack.
negative;While in the novella they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids.<br /><br />Lastly that Mattie and Ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale.<br /><br />The change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change.<br /><br />Neeson and Arquette are superb in their portrayals.
negative;I rather liked the first season but the second season was dry and pulling things out of thin air that should of stayed with the clouds.
negative;I do agree that the acting was fairly decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was intriguing enough.
positive;You will find the outline, plot etc elsewhere on this site.Consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single, hand- held,16mm camera... all the dialogue is improvised... none of the 'actors' had appeared in front of a camera before...
positive;Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat.
positive;Costumes, Props and Sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions.
negative;which brings out another point-the main character of the original work, prospero, is not so named in this rendition despite the fact that most other characters' names are used.
negative;True fans of Austen will rush home to watch their DVDs of the far superior 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds.
positive;There's really no point to the sing-off.
positive;Well that's part of the mystery, they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love.
positive;An extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast.
negative;My advice: skip this one and wait for the sequel.
negative;When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you will, a feeling he's never felt before.
negative;But then...
negative;Particularly Eric Alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of Animal Control.
negative;And William Baldwin is a plank.
positive;This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably.
negative;How old is this girl?
positive;<br /><br />Slaughter is now stumped.
positive;Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to give my thanks to a wonderful lady that responded to my message almost a year later.
positive;Think of Resovoir Dogs.
negative;However she provided some clarity, as she was the only normal character in the picture, which actually isn't saying much for the film.
negative;No problem, let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut/editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious way possible.<br /><br />The movie score is rather poor.
negative;In tow are her a**hole photographer Carlo (a haggard-looking Gabriele Tinti) and some blonde woman who is never named.
positive;Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual will get overlooked.
positive;Swift's socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well done remake.
negative;Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.<br /><br />Overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.<br /><br />If the film were better executed, it would have been excellent.
negative;"Too bad Howard Higgin wasn't that strong; as it is, watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like Armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak, one can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him."
negative;Lil' flip?
negative;"<br /><br />It's written about ""working-class"" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing."
positive;These two films shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence but to a young boy it isn't high production values or continuity that capture your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots!<br /><br />P.S.
negative;The witch's cannibal son was made a retard (I don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed at both).
negative;"Ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for ""Lady Frankenstein"", a stagy, costumy Italian corpse-walker."
negative;weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, i wonder why Udita Goswami is there in the movie world in the first place ?
positive;The copy on DVD that we watched from 'Delta Entertainment' came from a good master.
negative;This was just awful.
negative;I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.<br /><br />WHAT???
negative;Basically this is a movie that thinks it's clever by trying to shock people and thinking they'll laugh at it.
negative;They can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there's no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as Masters works his magic on that big bird.
negative;This movie really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone had she gotten that one big role that was right for her.
negative;The plot is inane, the special effects awful, the sound track the most benawl, infernal tootling I have ever heard.
positive;However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context.<br /><br />Mr.
positive;Who knew that Ted could rap?
positive;I first saw this in the theater in 1969 when I was 9 and immediately fell in love with it.
negative;in fact, all aspects that made the stage version of 'the tempest' full of wonder and intrigue have been sucked completely from this convoluted version about a self-absorbed, pompous arse who can't figure out how to care about anything beyond the blur of his wealth and power.
positive;The plot was very suspenseful.
positive;The ending also has an unusual twist, particularly for a 1950's science fiction film.
negative;No wonder the acting was dreadful: no one knew how to say such idiotic lines.<br /><br />If I were Claire Danes, I'd be going after my agent with a flame-thrower right now.
positive;The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly amazing.
negative;"""<br /><br />The script and plot are ludicrous, the female lead is unconvincing."
negative;3) Brad Pitt's southern, supposedly Tennessee accent is HORRIBLE and thoroughly annoying throughout the entire move.
negative;the fight between Lil' Jon and Lil' bow wow and Lil flip was MAD corny and short.
positive;"For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the ""beast"" growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-ju's skin and his eye's widen in blood-lust for it."
positive;It's a funny, action-packed, gory take on the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie.
positive;)<br /><br />I love this film, if anyone hasn't seen it yet, don't listen to the critic above...watch it and then decide for yourself!!
positive;"In the words of Glen Friedman - ""It was F-ing unbelievable."""
positive;I caught this movie on local t.v.
positive;"Those folks direct their friendship, love and compassion to ""James Kennedy,"" better known as ""Radio,"" a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr."
negative;As it turns out, there was a very good reason why not.
positive;The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes.
positive;He eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools across the world, without compromising his teachings.
positive;"We learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone)."
negative;It's a classic.
negative;"Perhaps it is a matter of scale; the film is so stage-bound that I laughed out loud once it was mentioned that ""five million"" people lived in the city."
positive;This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal.
negative;Well, she was the highlight.
positive;This bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on, however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble.<br /><br />The Happiest Days Of Your Life is based on the John Dighton play from 1948, with Dighton writing the part of Headmistress Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford.
negative;Pretty hard to watch beyond the first 10 minutes.
negative;The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.<br /><br />The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused.
positive;"In fact, Farscape feels a lot like a ""Blake's 7"" with good special effects and a bit more romance.<br /><br />Everyone, enjoy!"
positive;The whole audience up at the Sunset Five was riveted, when the film ended no one moved, spoke, nothing.
negative;Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm-hearted Mary, played by Blair.
positive;Consequently alot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes.
negative;(see the sarcasm here).
negative;Basically I started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when I did look up.<br /><br />It may work for you, it didn't for me.
negative;"However, there is plenty of outside opinion, within both the chess and computer science communities, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as ""dumb machines"" and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all."
positive;And not a lank haired ghost lady in sight??
positive;Complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home.
negative;This is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it.
negative;Yes, I spelled that right.
negative;"trap.<br /><br />""Romeo and Juliet"" carried this idea off much more successfully, but I really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. edgy film).<br /><br />Just because this is a ""modern"" retelling, doesn't mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or have anything to do with drugs or guns.<br /><br />If the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words, Macbeth would be a far more powerful film."
positive;POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS TO PLOT !!!!!
positive;"The other dudes are very colorful and personable as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire Tony Alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work."
positive;Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world.
negative;Otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-par flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like The Hills Have Eyes remake.
negative;"Any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity, the only thing thats keeps this film in the videoplayer (apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no-one else) is the fact that although painful, this film is unintentionally hilarious, i'm not at all a fan of those ""so bad that it's funny"" type of films but at parts i was in tears."
negative;Surprisingly, all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.<br /><br />Really lame.
positive;In the case of New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added TEOS out-takes... Calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil.
positive;The nice girl who is Harry's date has a little dog who chases him away.
positive;This is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything Disney releases.
negative;But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies.
positive;He's all about the game, except--for his pointy thing.
positive;Ms. Gill's lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany.
negative;At first I thought it was going to be some disturbing, unseen evil force (having not read the book) to terrify the audience -- but it turns out to be something rather mundane -- killer plants.
positive;This is not a movie for kids!
negative;Steel work is dangerous.
positive;I was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was.
negative;All the hot buttons of the Seventies are pushed in this one.
positive;Nor is a typical drama or suspense movie.it is rather more of an amalgamation of all, having the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex, suspenseful plot.<br /><br />This is an ensemble piece, and the cast does an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters.
negative;I went out and bought it, cause it's just so damn funny.
positive;"he's a demon on wheels~~~"" over and over again."
negative;I was permanently scarred by this terrible film.<br /><br />The main action of the movie is nothing special.
positive;She is a believable action hero and I don't think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance Geena Does.
positive;Aside from Caroline Langrishe's captive Irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do (Stephane Audran never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but Anthony Harvey's film does boast terrific Scope photography from Billy Williams and a good score from Marc Wilkinson.
positive;This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio is alone playing `Fuer Elise' in lobby of the Hotel and Gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song.
negative;As a writer and a lapsed Orthodox Jewish woman, I was let down tremendously by this movie.
negative;<br /><br />Damian is a bad writer and a bad director.
positive;Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years, with Mike Myers' 'Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson's 'Johnny English', and more recently Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'Get Smart!
negative;3.
positive;Can you withstand an independent, low-budget film?
negative;Until then, the show, Mind of Mencia is a pass.
negative;Is he running out of dough for his escapades to India that he takes on anything they serve him?
positive;A bumbling error at the Ministry Of Education results in Nutbourne Boys School having to share with St Swithin's School For Girls.
negative;However, as a young generation Y'er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60's TV show, this movie pained me from the moment I entered and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the part.
negative;Why didn't we get to know his Mother, Father and brother and the relationships between them... what made him the psychopath he was... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became?
negative;One good-looking actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant, who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion.
negative;This movie is just plain dumb.
negative;This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen.
positive;One was a funny romp with Robin Williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway, but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle.
negative;This show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap.
negative;The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful.
negative;"Along the way, she falls for a guy named Charmin (yes, like the toilet paper - make your own jokes) and finds out how ""Mad Max"" rejects live."
positive;Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (Or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one Occupies in the relationship, in life and how they cope with the Confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be.
negative;The whole thing is so awful that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison.
positive;Though a little stilted in places, the movie aches with romantic longing, and deserves plaudits for its honesty and compassion.
positive;If for nothing else, watch this movie for Shahrukh.
positive;fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes, great actors, and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like.
positive;Her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part.
positive;(Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
positive;"It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like ""Tommy Boy"" to remember how truly funny he was."
negative;"Produced, directed, and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it's no surprise that ""Clonus"" fails to horrify anyone in the least, much less keep anyone's attention!"
positive;"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett."
positive;I am a big Puppet Master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored through the entire course of watching Retro Puppet Master.
negative;It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence.
negative;He catches up to Kirk and saves him ONE FOOT away from the ground.
negative;That saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster.
positive;By the end of the second DVD Page is struggling with his sanity during the Knebworth songs.
positive;The character who started out as a `jerk' becomes important and valued in his own right - as you learn to `forgive' his previous behavior in light of new information.
positive;"Also, Bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still ""Hot"" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups."
positive;Such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance.
negative;And the prayer beeds on top of that make things a little confusing.
positive;The effect left me to conclude: things are not as they seem.<br /><br />FM is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age.
positive;A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot.
negative;Anyway, I liked somehow (and just a little) the brunette actress, Natasha something, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of Face-off (changing faces), so Two Girls and a Guy to the bottom goes... <br /><br />Stay away from this ****!
negative;Instead, a film that offers a top-notch Eurocult cast and never delivers the goods will piss every viewer off, except the hardcore Laura Gemser completist.
positive;That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.<br /><br />Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however.
positive;"""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship."
negative;The world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again, but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one.
positive;Was Ms. Sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power??
negative;This movie, in terms of casting, acting, and drama was his best.
negative;Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to look off-camera for his line, and it's not even edited out.
positive;I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts.
positive;I laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether.
positive;"When a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot, the initial suggestion is of the boy's point of view; by the end it is much more the dog's."
positive;Whilst on the subject of audio effects, the soundtrack is worth a mention.
negative;Over 12, you will be snoring after the opening credits.
negative;"It's up there with ""Crossbones"" and ""Southern Comfort"", but if your a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years."
negative;The only part I found like a bit interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing.
negative;A staple of the genre.
positive;Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact in to one, 8 out of 10
positive;Serling was bright enough to let him return to the present, but is the present the same?
negative;This is supposed to enrage the American viewers of this scene.
negative;Actually, you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his bicycle, but you know it's there anyway, just because that's the sort of film this is.<br /><br />At best, the narration becomes background hum, serving as a perfect compliment to the coma-inducing visuals.
negative;The core issues at play (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be & should be tremendously compelling (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art/music/literature/film).
positive;One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active.
negative;A thorough waste of celluloid.
positive;A 9/10.<br /><br />
negative;If the director is still alive: 1.
negative;This is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time.
positive;Then why are we subjected to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious.
negative;The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion.
negative;Unfortunately for the men, the women had put them under a spell, derived from snake venom, which would make them die horribly in 100 days -- their bellies swollen like a pregnant woman's with live worms and snakes -- if they did not return.<br /><br />Forget the cover of the US video.
negative;"In the mountains of Japan, forlorn young artist Sessue Hayakawa (as Tatsu aka ""The Dragon Painter"") paints magnificent landscapes."
negative;The photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />One final point, the wife was overly pleasing to the eye.
positive;The opening is a little confusing, but by the end, it doesn't matter.
positive;Rarely do you see a Crime film that is so entertaining and fresh.
positive;"Add on the big city Christmas of ""Meet John Doe"", and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around."
negative;There is a railroad museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture.
negative;It was just about the stupidest thing I every watched.
positive;In terms of acting, it is mostly convincing.
positive;Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight.
positive;"I can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was, reflecting the apathy of adolescents (this was before Generation ""X"").<br /><br />In a way, most of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank.<br /><br />What would they do today?"
positive;I learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show.<br /><br />This latest installment of Doctor Who made a great impression on me.
negative;Neat !
positive;It is violent and has a little language (though most of it is covered up).
negative;AND, as I recall from the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS.<br /><br />-ASTRID is apparently BLOND, as opposed to the notably RED HAIR described in the book.
positive;Is this a new evolution coming about?
positive;He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a wholesome Canadian farm girl destined for fame.
positive;Go rent it and tape it :).
negative;Did you know that people that live down deep in the earth have Austrailian accents?
negative;Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd sandwich.
negative;In my opinion, the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption.
negative;like that's the greatest thing a red-blooded American can do?
negative;<br /><br />The setting is a 'deep south' that probably never existed - the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton, the dyed-in-the-wool racists (Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version of a Klansman) are laughable in their villainy.
positive;Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children.
negative;I have gotten into more arguments about this film than probably any others and will continue to argue against it.
positive;The Oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by the crafty cinematography.
negative;It is a good fifteen minutes.
positive;Every single bit of the plot is predictable.
negative;Then, we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug-addled student researching the supernatural, living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead.
positive;A very interesting take on the genre indeed.
positive;Or for the faint of hearted!
negative;Its like someone just asked 'I wonder what Hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride.
positive;When I look for hope, I have the Bible...the first most widely read non-fiction book in the world.
positive;Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in.
negative;They figure, if they think it's funny then everyone will think it's funny.
negative;Perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story?
negative;"Also, I don't think I've ever seen a ""stoner"" sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh, but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery."
positive;I would highly recommend this film.
positive;That is what great drama does, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
positive;When I first saw this film on video in a department store... it intrigued me.
positive;No band, no where, no way has EVER been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this DVD.
negative;If you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague.
negative;And if there's one thing that Evan Almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism.<br /><br />The film (a sequel to the much funnier Bruce Almighty) starts out by reintroducing the audience to Evan Baxter, a mere supporting at best character in the original film.
positive;One of the few shows that I try to watch on a regular basis.
negative;The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a leg-dragging Frankenstein in mummy wrappings, who exhibits no signs of intelligent life.
positive;I highly recommend this movie!
positive;As usual, Randolph Scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance.
negative;When I watch 'Gomeda' I fell into so hopeless,so sad for young Turkish movie maker.Please,please don't make 'cinema' like this!
negative;"But the movie wouldn't be quite as ""satisfying"" for the Americans and Jews craving Nazi blood."
negative;Usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events but in this film it seems more like a licence to kill because even new crimes (like e.g.
positive;The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions.
negative;Stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical.
negative;Then he makes up a story that he tried to break up with her, and she threw a chair out of the window.
positive;He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself.
negative;There is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes???
positive;The cast members are all Sergio Martino regulars (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is a neat supportive rule) and give away great performances.
negative;In closing, PM7 is recomended for true fanatics who happen to be masochists.<br /><br />Roach<br /><br />
negative;He looks like he is doing the Robot Dance most of the time.
positive;He figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them, they were dead.
positive;"i get that, although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role - and not convincingly attracted to the ""stranger"" - so that's a failing - the unspoken bonding between the Rickman character and the ""stranger"" is better done, even if we are not sure what it is."
negative;Ric White (Director, Writer, Lead Actor, etc) takes himself a bit too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves....Do yourself a favor....skip this one.
positive;Very clever.
negative;If you were to watch it, watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout (BTW this movie is supposed to be serious)
negative;In between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the film makers.
positive;Sorry to say it doesn't hold up.
positive;Probably.
positive;It's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952.
negative;I didn't develop any connection with this character.
negative;You can almost hear the TV executives sprouting buzz words at each other.
positive;The Seven Ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt.
positive;That's the beauty of it though and what sets it apart.
positive;"Well, in certain doses, yes...and this film let out in a bit on ... ""how"".<br /><br />Being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time I saw this so I focused more on the ""rich"" and ""famous"" part between the two."
negative;The premise is interesting and sounded promising.
negative;From what I saw the military had the upper hand, people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing, it just wouldn't have happened that way?
negative;There are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible.
negative;There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate.
negative;It has literally ruined my life.
negative;Here's why this movie fell very short of its potential(I don't read much, so I don't care WHAT the novel was like).
negative;Did I mention that there were some plot holes?
positive;"I think every critic who panned ""Tommy Boy"" when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all."
positive;The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church.
negative;This is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was's love to star in.
positive;Don't get me wrong, for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were ground-breaking and provided the goods well, but CMI steps up and delivers a superb cartoon-style game-play which is both fun and satisfying.
negative;Yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, and probably the best part of the experience.
positive;"Macy is the archetypal ""nice guy with something to hide""."
positive;i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods.
positive;"Jean Gabin's ""Danglard"" keeps running afoul of genital politics, but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh."
negative;Obviously, aficionados of terrible film-making will want to see this, but it's very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad-movie viewer you are.
positive;'<br /><br />Which leads to my final comment.
negative;I did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in Weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy.
positive;Nevertheless, I recommend it, with caution.
negative;The lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind-up toy capable of staying right-side-up while walking through sand.
negative;She is still very talented and charming.
positive;And he himself makes the journey in SEPARATE LIES by understanding his faults, embracing his wife, despite all that has gone on, and leading her back to London.
positive;After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to go out and purchase the video and the soundtrack.
positive;After the second movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play Mr. Bean again.
positive;"""Have you ever thought about being on the stage?"""
negative;One slip of the foot/butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man-eating plants and beasties.
negative;She goes and investigates the site of her father's death, only to get sucked into a subterranean world that's part dystopian nightmare, part uninspiring fantasy, and inhabited by rejects from the Plasmatics.
negative;very boring, and the music is as equally interesting.
negative;Don't expect Oscar material on this one, guys.
negative;A sad state when the female voice-over for the computer is the best actor.
positive;"At first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on VHS rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie ¬ñ ""Railway Children"" was created during a time when purity was more than just saying ""no"", when family meant everything, and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend."
positive;I don't watch very many 'horror' movies, but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins.
positive;His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did.
positive;"It had a lot going for it: Burt Reynolds actor and director, a solid one-two punch; a William Diel novel adaptation, and the south land of Atlanta Georgia, at this time, a land of opportunity for film production out of Hollywood.<br /><br />Reynolds' Tom Sharky falling in love with Rachel Ward's Dominoe the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold is here echoed as it was in ""Hustle"" when he played opposite Catherine Deneuve, and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core, but with downbeat ending not the Hollywood happiness in ""Sharky's Machine"".<br /><br />The story is pure Detective procedure/actioner."
positive;I enjoyed, appreciated, will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed.
positive;Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio creditably and for light entertainment Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.
negative;The plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway.
positive;This movie is not that bad.
negative;That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4.
negative;Unfortunately, all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummy-voiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults.
positive;In order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.<br /><br />This film is hilarious and got me laughing many times.
positive;He plays a very complex and real character very convincingly.
negative;This tepid pile of wood chips was the last hurrah from long-time editor-turned-director Dan Milner, who quickly vanished into well-deserved obscurity following this film.
negative;Not the music, but the few stills it contains.
positive;"The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman, a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwar's ""interrogation"" at the hands of Egyptian officials."
positive;Ramsey has the showier, sexier role (he's first seen doing something rude to a willing participant!
positive;"If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed, all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion."
negative;4) The lad who gets all the girls 5) The lad from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand.
negative;No, it's none of these likely suspects.
negative;"All the internet thing is so clich√©, and the producer obviously didn't understand all the ""internet rules""."
negative;on top of that there is not one character you actually root for - you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up.<br /><br />The script is embarrassing - The red herring's are signposted well in advance, someone else has mentioned this but 'The scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire engulfing the building with his broom....hilarious, or same janitor going into a room marked 'Hazardous Material', Were these scenes supposed to be tongue-in-cheek?
negative;For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film.
negative;They dress weird and act weirder.
negative;You watch it and are shocked.
positive;This short film certainly pulls no punches.
negative;And that is why this movie received such a high ranking.
negative;But instead, the suck factor took over and possessed him.
positive;Her dancing, while sultry, is surpassed by her dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the temple dancer Seetha.<br /><br />One problem with the movie is the closed setting.
negative;When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction?
positive;hold onto your lunch kids, this isnt going to be pretty!
positive;A must see.
negative;or if you're a human and want to learn the same.<br /><br />0.5/10: A half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores.
negative;It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson only more annoying!!!
negative;She is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side.
positive;Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.
negative;I would like to say before I continue that I wasn't expecting this to win an Oscar.
positive;I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez were playing father and son - it made their relationship more believable,
positive;As for the guys played by veteran character actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how Crawford became so bitter and nasty.<br /><br />This film has it all--adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc.
negative;I'll be honest I can't talk about the ending.
negative;<br /><br />Seems Ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls down into the center of the earth to find him.
negative;The majority of the movie focuses around an enormous dragon egg that hatches into a not-so-enormous baby dragon with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen.
positive;In 1927, it was believed no man could fly the breath of the Atlantic Ocean.
negative;Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown.
negative;This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally.
negative;i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes.
negative;A cartoon dino, of cart board would do even a better job then this.
negative;Carole Lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness.<br /><br />As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me.
negative;This movie has no continuity, no plot, no anything, really.
positive;This movie is truly unique.
negative;But it's also interesting to notice what happens (and here comes the plot giveaway, though it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father.
positive;Her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) have always a moral rationale.<br /><br />In conclusion, a wonderful movie.
negative;Are there totally run out of good ideas?
negative;Flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it, however.<br /><br />The dancing horrible.
negative;This show truly is swill for the brain dead accepters of mediocrity.
negative;It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was.
negative;But my major objection is the fact this is yet another movie financed with Canadian and Ontario tax credits which is ashamed to set itself in Canada, yet again proving that the Canadian film industry is craven and opportunistic.
positive;Back to the point: Toy Soldiers is simply a great movie.
positive;Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination.
negative;I was beyond disappointed.
positive;Also, there is one scene in this film, one of those grandiose wide-screen shots of the English countryside that is just breath-taking, but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background.
positive;Ever dependable Rahul Bose plays another pivotal role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection.
negative;Yeah, definitely not.
negative;In reality what you get is a slow, dull, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects), and messy film which is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive.
positive;for this series on YouTube.
negative;What should i say?
positive;The CMI script is clever, appropriate and, above all, absolutely hilarious.
positive;However, OVER 21 is unique in so many ways, as it shows a side of the war you won't see in other films--making it well worth seeing, even if you have seen the bazillion other films!
negative;"Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some, there were definitely none present at the ""unforgettable"" House Party, nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance."
positive;not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting.
negative;"I wonder how many people in the theaters tried to slit their wrists while crying out: ""mother, make it stop."
positive;The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman.
negative;If you value your time, please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one.
negative;How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general.
negative;No mutant killer fish like in Roger Corman's singly-named Piranha.
positive;However Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything.
positive;The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.
positive;But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother (Em√≠lia V√°s√°ryov√°).
negative;then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet.
negative;The scary kind.<br /><br />In the end of this movie, the non-believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the Rapture has started (which is believed by Christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non-believers are left behind).<br /><br />When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, 'just in case we Christians are right'.
negative;However, it's the way and attitude with which our would-be heroes kill.
positive;"We have had three years of this, you can stop it now."""
negative;Directors fault?
positive;The film ends with Divine, Waters' 300 lbs.
positive;Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer.
positive;The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone, and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood.
negative;It's a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality.
negative;<br /><br />And it goes on for nearly two and a half hours!!
negative;The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones.
positive;He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers.
positive;I'm a horror-movie-lover.
negative;But since viewing it, I know there is not a God, because if there was, he wouldn't have let this film be produced.
positive;Great acting by Carla Gugino.
negative;"All you need to know is, this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" flick."
positive;I believe most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to his designs.
positive;Some will call it trash, some will call it brilliant.
negative;Even European Vacation's Eric Idle cannot save the show in a brief cameo....<br /><br />Pathetic and sad...actually painful to watch....Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst of the Vacation franchise.
negative;He than seems to become friends with Jjaks and they try to get money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body.
negative;"And as far as ""brutal"", well, the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film."
positive;I have a letter from Ms. Knight, who went to college with my older sister.
positive;****.
positive;Yes, aspects could have been finessed if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent movie from Canada this is a tender, gently humorous, very touching tale about vulnerability and communication and commitment.
positive;Daily.
positive;The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch.
negative;Every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored.
positive;Ridley is there, and the two connect.
positive;I would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie.
positive;"Geez<br /><br />I really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror, and hot stuff ;) I like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her."
positive;In this series, Oyama's most famous student, Sonny Chiba, is called upon to portray his master.<br /><br />Oyama arrives from the countryside where he has been training alone.
positive;A lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor who I cannot wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
positive;Rating = 3.5 stars (of five).
positive;"""Oh, f___ Bule,"" James says."
negative;Watchable nevertheless.
positive;"Rather they are a sort of grouping of Editorial Cartoons much like those from any ""Great Metropolitan Newspaper""."
negative;"""Eric"" is played by Jonathan Jackson.<br /><br />3."
positive;The funeral scene is hysterical!
positive;We didn't do anything except skate around trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of Skateboarder Magazine.
positive;I actually first watched One Dark Night in the theater & wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper.
positive;Its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless unlock ables.
negative;The violence was relentless and insane.
negative;If Disney can use a random H!School, why couldn't the directer have found a random H!School?
positive;It's the best performance that I've seen from Ms. Capshaw--she's been in more movies than I thought, but this was a wonderful achievement.
negative;A few friends were going and asked if I wanted to come along.
negative;The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right.
negative;The cinematography is mediocre, but may be the best part of the movie.<br /><br />The acting is bad.
negative;"That's how I was when I walked (staggered) out of this ""film""."
positive;Secondly having brought to the screen the Dead End kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with Warner Brothers, he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins.
positive;I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events.
negative;Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time.
positive;I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.<br /><br />It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up.
negative;It's amazing!!
negative;It is so dumb and vulgar.
positive;"Alone, Joe is quiet; together with someone else, he becomes lethal."
positive;The reason?
positive;Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one.
positive;She does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top.
negative;So this series actually does have some likable characters.
negative;Like I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't fall for it.
positive;And whether or not you `believe' the story line of the film, you have to admit, it is different!<br /><br />Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw past the surface level of this film.
negative;I don't get it.
positive;"If you happen not to like black-and-white ""foreign"" films, you may still enjoy ""Voskhozhdeniye"" (retiled in English ""The Ascent"")."
negative;(However, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.)
negative;And not to forget Spock rocketing through the air after Kirk when he falls from a cliff in Yosemite.
positive;)<br /><br />Set in the late '50's, it began with university academic Jeffrey Fairbrother ( Simon Cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of Maplin's, a job he was ill equipped to handle.
positive;And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light.
negative;While the premise interesting(rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with Richard(Tim Donnelly), a clone who is at once both boring and irritating.
negative;blood, that must mean its good right?
positive;Great work, Chris!
negative;That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked.
positive;No car chases either.<br /><br />JUST talking/ It is so refreshing to listen to people talk, & here we must read subtitles as well.<br /><br />The acting is near perfect by all.
positive;, and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time .
negative;As a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but is devoid of a purpose as well, and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up.
positive;"A new Captain arrives on-board, already known by a few as ""Dead Pan"" Toler (Walter Huston) and he's a real stickler for following the rule book and a ""code of honor""."
negative;"Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"""
negative;The result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique.<br /><br />Forget about all the rest, it's not worth talking about...<br /><br />I give 1point for Ms.Theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film.
negative;over all, a lackluster effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration.
positive;I dare anyone to not find at least SOMETHING in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.
negative;But I don't.
negative;Later Karmen visits the warden's room and they make love - unfortunately the scene is not detailed, and is very short, although there is some nudity.<br /><br />Karmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man, named Lamine, maybe a Colonel - it was never really clear who he was, watches her.
positive;One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange.
negative;Really?
positive;It took him 3 years to complete this 86 minute long film and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial troubles or problems with the actors.
negative;I just finished watching Dog Watch.
negative;Coming from a true Puppet Master fan, I would expect to hear myself say this, but it's true.
positive;First off, I have been a fan of the show back when my PBS station started showing it back in 1981.
positive;You get it all.
negative;"I can't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking ""Man, dis !"
positive;All the while I was reading about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay.
negative;I was really looking forward to this, as I finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time.
positive;Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing.
negative;The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is just pointless and evokes NO horror or fear.
negative;:¬ç
positive;I especially enjoyed Miep Gies' testimony, and marvel that she is still strong and alive today.
negative;If you haven't seen it don't bother.
positive;Presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature, and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains, lakes, and waterfalls.
negative;"Understandably horrified at the prospect, the kids, in order to foil their parents' plan, come up with a scheme in which Raj will go live with one of their children, while Pooja will live with another; then they will switch off until, eventually, each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum."
negative;Christine Lahti plays a crass, cynical TV news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and is soon having dinner with Moore and her family--only to discover Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret affair!
negative;Zucco looks good on camera, he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow.
negative;According to this masterpiece of film-making's script (pun intended), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention.
negative;Disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting...would do it.
negative;Acting is terrible, there is no plot whatsoever, there is no point whatsoever, i felt robbed after i rented this movie.
positive;But he's not out to tickle your funny bone.
positive;"Put this one-of-a-kind kitsch classic at the top of your ""guilty pleasures"" list, and enjoy."
negative;"Laughing over the pain of others simply because they were ""the bad guys."""
negative;That was the movie which put Hayworth on the Hollywood map, yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular.
positive;Sometimes, he's not able to play down (what's he got, like, a 104?)
negative;<br /><br />I find this movie disappointing so that's explains the vote (4).
positive;"Every character eventually gets it, and they don't find their prince charming at first glance and they don't just ""fall in love"" with every guy that comes their way."
negative;Boooo Lion's Gate!<br /><br />Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope that I've saved others from renting or owning it.
negative;It's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even figure out what it's saying).<br /><br />This movie is simply art for art's sake.
positive;Counting my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theatre.
positive;It's worth a watch.
negative;"The dialog is Lenzi's usual silliness, as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them ""tw@t"" and the like."
negative;"As I read the script on-line, I thought ""Capote"" needed a trim."
negative;Namely a scene involving somebody's face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from cars.<br /><br />To the filmmaker's credit, there are a couple interesting scenes.
negative;"Not in those ""time waves"" they made."
negative;It's quite distracting to say the least.
positive;The images from `Paradise' are anything but that, and `The Golden Age' is darkly comic ¬ñ the highest culture is the strange roadside musical act.<br /><br />The Popol Vuh suggests that mankind is the central object of creation, but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion.
positive;I have literally burned out my N64 playing this great game, along with Zelda OOT.
negative;"My God, how the HECK can anybody label these as ""movies"" ???"
negative;Well, they're wrong.
positive;He's just as near to a god as a fella can get.
positive;His dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country.
positive;at about 4:30 a.m.
negative;But appearances can be deceiving.
positive;"""It's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters."""
positive;I did like this movie.
positive;(And of course Nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a Czarina!)
positive;In all this dogma fuzz, please note that this is the Danish masterpiece of the 20th century.
positive;In 1960, I was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me.
negative;This isn't it.
negative;The sad thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film.
negative;My biggest peeve, Hassan was Amir's brother...really?
negative;The scares could have been better if the music wasn't ripped from a cheap horror sounds CD.
negative;The young glamorous female Police Commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared State of Emergency and gets it (as if!).
positive;This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.<br /><br />A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie
positive;It is powerful stuff.
positive;"Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to ""surrender""."
positive;"Maybe he could come back for ""Return of the Meatballs"", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (Meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic).<br /><br />""Meatballs"" is easily on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (not really guilty either)."
negative;"The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa, and Robert Kerman) does their best in the face of the escalating idiocy (including a completely ludicrous ""castration preservation""), but cannot save this overworked, lousy effort."
negative;Watch My Wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography.
negative;They walk off disappointed but they understand, as do all the other times in film this has happened.
positive;Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies I've witnessed for a long time that even I, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me.
positive;While nice guy Dean Jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons.
positive;I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breaths.
negative;Sure, they're cheap.
negative;Once I saw the fourth and fifth one I was beginning to get irate.
negative;Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job, at least then we wouldn't have to listen to the terrible dialogue.
negative;I wouldn't even call this a horror movie, since most of the movie is actually about the (mis)adventures of the aforementioned, narcissistic 20-somethings, which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high (isn't as entertaining as it sounds--trust me).
positive;The Regard of Flight, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen.
negative;Other than that, the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, do redeem it a little, but not enough.
positive;Is that the holideck doctor from Star Trek: Voyager?
negative;In between these things, you get to enjoy blank, black screen.
positive;"...means ""take up and read"", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.<br /><br />Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name."
negative;The poet Carne disappears (didn¬¥t he disappeared with Pr√©vert?)
positive;I was surprised, though, with Robert Young being also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision--he was supposed to be a Harvard-educated Easterner.
positive;Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future western productions.
negative;His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous.
positive;The movie appeared to be complete, color and clarity was fare, but good considering how old this movie is without any repairs on frames.
negative;Aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot, this movie wasn't too bad.
negative;Silly scenario, silly characters and no originality.
negative;I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra.
positive;He is one versatile I really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well.
positive;For a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest.
positive;Billy Hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in Moscow by an American director.
positive;So what if it's improbable?
negative;the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise), the story and characters fall flat.<br /><br />This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of midway through.
positive;I wanted to know the men behind the myths.<br /><br />Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary.
positive;Niagara, Niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy.
negative;It seemed dull to me, much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out.
negative;I bet it was expensive too.
negative;I think one of the Three Stooges is the tour guide at the beginning.
positive;"He shouted back: ""Think of the neighbours!"
positive;This movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional, but at the same time very romantic.
negative;Sample at your own risk.
positive;Great cast, great movie.
positive;It's really not a silly romantic comedy.
negative;Most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are lit at all.
negative;It's awful and I don't even have a clue how it got any distribution.
negative;Crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, Total Reality was harsh but this Expect to Die is just utter nonsense.
negative;This film tries hard but fails.
positive;The dancers are amazing.
negative;(I'm a male) and I would rather give myself a papercut on the opening of my urethra before viewing this again (seriously).<br /><br />2.
negative;Now I'm doubting whether this guy actually ever saw it, because that isn't the way I would summarize it in one word.
negative;I'm sure they watched some Kaurism√§ki, too, to find out what it is about his films that people like, misunderstood him completely, and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of s**t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography.
positive;There are filmed instances of Oyama actually doing this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tethered as Oyama was getting on in years.
positive;And to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good.
negative;John Vernon plays the dean...
positive;Eventually the girls do show up and the date begins.
negative;In conclusion, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect to its namesake, go for it.
negative;"""<br /><br />This is a very, very gory movie."
positive;He is constantly put upon by others.
negative;There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough.
positive;This covers just about every area of the creative process, and goes through the three stages chronologically, with the main focus squarely placed on the production.
positive;Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other.
positive;If such characters actually exist, it is hard for the soul.
positive;I mean, even now I can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie.<br /><br />This movie is about a 14 year old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) that leave their home town in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills.<br /><br />At first Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years (usually down, might I add).<br /><br />Although this explanation is a little vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely.
positive;As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping/journey home story in 101 Dalmatians.<br /><br />But to overcome this flaw, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the Disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) voicing one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers.
negative;There were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in, let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time!<br /><br />And a third same question, how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the Japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife?
negative;It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor.
positive;Music by Nitin Sawhney is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing moods.
negative;The fighting scene between Ben and his brother is horribly dubbed.
positive;Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and totally lovely.
negative;The most half-assed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage.
positive;I love the quirky, ensemble cast shows, and a great setting always helps.
positive;There were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative.
positive;"""Only the Valiant"" qualifies as a gritty good western."
positive;Chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters, too.
negative;It's probably a cultural thing---somehow, the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny.
negative;I mean, come on.. who cares?<br /><br />In a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see Lector and Starling once again but, if you're going for a really good thriller... you'll jump once and be grossed out maybe twice.
positive;He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone, yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people.
positive;With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death.
negative;A must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.
negative;Inuyasha: He's a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword.
positive;Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
positive;And I promise I will drag every person I know to see it.
negative;One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
positive;It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.<br /><br />Jay Adams.
negative;Because i had read much enough about its (absence of) quality.
negative;Compared with similar films like e.g.
positive;A frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days.
negative;I'd say that you'd actually have to see this, it's so bad... my sides hurt when I laughed.
negative;"There are a few good jokes, mostly involving Granny's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says ""I tawt I taw a putty tat"", a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns."
negative;"An attempt at a ""Wanda"" type manic finish fails too, along with the effort at ""men in drag"" humour, which is hardly surprising."
positive;Plus, only Chuck Connors could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin!
positive;After recently seeing, Cry Uncle, by the same director, I decided to seek this out and am I glad I did!?
negative;Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not.
positive;They definitely add some levity to the film, but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance, or is this just another example of Herzog's playfullness.<br /><br />The narration aside, Herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack.
positive;Nothing could be farther from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of -a- kind documentary pretty much proves it!!
positive;With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s.
negative;Beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as film noir.
negative;So what if John Wayne gallops through the Wild West along a road lined with telephone poles?
negative;I was pretty much non-impressed with everything about this film.
negative;Skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location.
positive;But when CBS took it off the air my wife & I thought CBS made a big mistake.
negative;<br /><br />Oh, and I must mention the CGI-tastic kites!
negative;<br /><br />8.
negative;"Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry off fair maidens, so the Tabonga grabs plucky female scientist Dr. Terry Mason(Tina Carver, ""Hell on Frisco Bay"") & waddles off with her."
negative;I think there exists an opportunity for an effective, original, and smart slasher movie.
positive;This is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern California that was directed by James Bridges and stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas.
negative;And why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces?!
negative;All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes or, whatever, just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash wizardry movie that you have seen and there you have it.
negative;The first scene that I saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat guy, and the black guy who looked like Dave Chappelle, flying around in a crop duster thousands of feet in the air.
positive;Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.
positive;"The son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years, for as he states ""posterity""."
positive;"I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for ""15 Park Avenue""."
positive;It is also so funny I was almost crying with laughter.<br /><br />Like with most Troma its in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and yet add in some really good acting and a Shakespeare plot.
positive;They both do an astounding job, often bringing you to tears.
negative;This made 'Major League II' and 'Blues Brothers 2000' Oscar-worthy in comparison.<br /><br />I have tried to remember watching anything as bad as this in my life and was unable to come up with anything even close.
positive;"The three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or, at the very most, toss complaints back and forth to each other.<br /><br />""Late Chrysanthemums"" is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do much with very little."
positive;Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions.
negative;So that tells you how little it held my attention.
negative;There seems to be a spectrum of cinema.
positive;Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who romanced and lost Rusty's grandmother.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose, to the detriment of his club, because she has a chance at success that he can't give her.
positive;In those days, the Welsh language editions of 'The Radio Times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about.
positive;He has determined to leave that behind in favor of an uncluttered emptiness.
positive;Lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld.
positive;What was I thinking if its full moon tonight?!
negative;I was all in awe of the film looking at the promos and went to watch it FDFS The film was horrible to say the least<br /><br />The first scene is good and till they go to London things are funny but slowly the pace slackens and they is nothing funny about it<br /><br />The Manoj Joshi subplot is funny at places but is unwanted and adds to the boredom<br /><br />The drugs part is funny especially the monologue of Govinda<br /><br />The film goes on and on aimlessly just like a small kid has written it<br /><br />The interval brings a twist in the story but by then i lost hope<br /><br />The second half starts okay but the way things are handled makes a mockery The entire Arbaaz- Jackie angle is half baked Also how come people don't identify them?<br /><br />The climax is quite funny though stupid<br /><br />Priyadarshan is not at all in his elements, from this film he started doing craps and his films got bad and bad Music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stand out and AFREEN too Camera-work is good<br /><br />Akshay Kumar has white in his stubble and looks old but he acts well though this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy acting things look bearable Govinda looks out of shape, bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprising from Govinda seems too much pressure on him to comeback and Priyan fails to utilize him Paresh is okay in parts but overall just repeat act Manoj Joshi is funny at places Sharat Saxena is okay Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff looks overweight and acts in his sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad Lara Dutta shrieks to glory but fails to act
positive;A magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in American history.<br /><br />One little quibble: it's not clear why the film involves the Mormons, who, as far as I know, were never the pacifists the Quakers and Amish were.
negative;Someone actually bought this on the strength of Robert Carlylse.. OK, I missed the start.. but what I did see was so bad I thought, no...
positive;Each member of the gang deserves attention, Gil Bellows at his best.Gugino is remarkable.
positive;Like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the Asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned.
negative;The standout reason to watch this series, even though his appearances are very few.
negative;You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said?
positive;"The cats' owner, while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous.<br /><br />The real strength of the film is the voice work; after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic is continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp."
negative;"""<br /><br />Just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize."
negative;It was absolutely boring.
positive;Indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because I expected it to be all the way Konkona Sen's terrain.
positive;Eastwood is not a nice man.
positive;This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it's one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor.
positive;Best seen with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one by your side.
negative;"""Cece"" is played by Meagan Good.<br /><br />There are a couple other characters, namely a deputy played by Method Man, but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clich√©s.<br /><br />So, you're probably thinking, ""why does this movie require such a deep analysis?"
negative;Sometimes they hit the road on their bikes, making one feel even more sorry for Michael Madsen, since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film.
negative;furthermore i would suggest that Amitabh should retire already.
positive;Some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible.
negative;"The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details."
negative;It starts off with a kid laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom.
negative;There are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they don't do very well because they aren't given hardly any screen time.
negative;They kill off the popular people and make the low budget celebs win.
negative;In my defense, I believe I made a valiant effort to stand my ground - hoping things would turn around.
negative;My uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all sorts of stuff in his.
negative;Unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy.<br /><br />For example, why didn't the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him?
negative;One preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen.
positive;Dexter shines as the before-and-after Jim, who is determined, after discovering Schuyler's true character, to win Leila back, if he can.
negative;Jane is the first human tarzan encounters.
positive;In this one he has a female doll companion, hence the name.
positive;It may be the funniest movie that Bruce has done.
negative;These days, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good folks from Primetime Live are butt-kissing sessions with A-list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars.
positive;His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother Marjorie Main.<br /><br />Young Reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds.
positive;On our own graduation day, our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale.
negative;They have no pretensions at all.
positive;The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up.
negative;"First off, I saw another reviewer said this movie was ""fantastic""."
negative;I highly recommend checking out the MST3K version since it's hilarious and one of their best episodes ever.<br /><br />The movie on it's own is basically the kind of typical B-movie crud that Italian film-makers were churning out in the early to mid 80's.
negative;It has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man.
negative;I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement.
positive;I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent.
negative;"In the case of ""Full Ride"", the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea.<br /><br />Fortunately for most individual members of the cast, pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting."
positive;I enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series, and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC...).
negative;A lot of Asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on).
positive;Of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the Africans after discovering them hiding in the hold.
negative;<br /><br />SS is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder Trekkies love it.
positive;Just when I thought this film was about to slow down, it didn't.
positive;Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with!
positive;Streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt.
negative;Secdonly, it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen.
negative;I cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story.<br /><br />No computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface.
negative;It is not a retelling of the story.
negative;"You can watch ""Harlem Nights"" that's for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name Murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes."
negative;Yet in the book, when she comes home one night, her MOTHER, ESME is sitting on the couch, after fighting with ASTRID over GABRIEL.
negative;Cheers rang out through the land, I'm sure, when the alien rips the old doctor's head off and(apparently) eats it.
negative;Could they have made it any more obvious?
negative;"I managed to sit through the entire movie but also asked myself, ""Why?"
positive;As a musical is excellent.
positive;The mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money.
negative;I mean, his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor.
positive;Ed becomes so mad that he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people that are close to him, such as his wife and daughter.<br /><br />I first saw this movie back in 1998 and was baffled by what I had seen.
negative;For example, in the movie he was still dark when Neverland got raided the first time around.
positive;So he marries Irmgard whom he does not love and who does not love him.
negative;The trite plot elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic.
negative;Piece of junk, would've given it a 0 if I could have.
positive;I watched it twice.
positive;Peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today.
negative;2.
positive;Here is a TVM that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact DEADLY VOYAGE doesn`t deserve to be relegated to the TV schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top Hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - completely true <br /><br />For those who don`t know the story !!!!!
negative;Don't just peek...watch it 'till the end :))))))))) !
negative;I always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will ultimatley take you to another place and time or either go over the top (which most of the time is done in bad taste).
positive;The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls.
positive;<br /><br />I looked through the whole site that's linked to the DVD and got lost in all the articles, essays etc.that are there.
negative;The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.<br /><br />Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.
positive;You'll be in hysterics.
negative;"They mention ""Nuculor"", falling asleep at fine art, President's working for their vice pres, and appreciating tackles over solving real problems."
negative;The dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful, the characters, too engaged with lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the stunningly melodramatic, aren't allowed to expand into genuinely textured individuals.
positive;Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys were creating history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on.
positive;Where this film is quite rebellious (as compared with American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian.
negative;JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch.
negative;Usually I'd call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else.
negative;Regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks, the fact remains that it really REALLY does.
negative;The special FX are just rubbish, shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst I've ever seen, the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera.
negative;There are action sequences that keep repeating - and we're not talking the quickfire 1-2-3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors, we're talking many, many repeats of long, bad fight sequences.
positive;Do not by pass by this film.
negative;"There's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance, without music (though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him), in the middle of a Paris street; Korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine.<br /><br />The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over, and drop food into, impoverished areas nearby."
positive;In a way, these short films were promotional trailers that featured new talent in front, or behind the camera.
positive;We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that.
negative;my god this is like drawing human ears on a cat, boobs on superman, or mickey mouse with blond shirley temple curls - even in animation it just doesn't work!
negative;All of your cannibal movie conventions are touched on but it never feels like they are filmed with any real conviction, other than to try and bully Ruggero Deodato out of the sandbox.
negative;Lord McGiveth and the Lord McTaketh...<br /><br />Why is Khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength?
positive;So I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed.<br /><br />If you can get past the very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world.
negative;"The parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not; the ""elegaic"" parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music; the ""emotional"" parts are simplistic.<br /><br />The worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters, except for a little cornball dignity in the priest.<br /><br />I still can't believe the respect some people have given this picture."
negative;1 out of 10.
positive;Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded Laura.
positive;"Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion(Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his ""affliction"" but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor.)."
negative;And the culmination of the plot... *oh sigh*... poor, poor, poor!
positive;But those are minor complaints.<br /><br />This film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences.
negative;Although the actual story definitely isn't the worst I've ever seen, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts sheer ineptitude.
negative;It shows in every scene.
positive;didn't have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less.
negative;"clearly possessing a budget allowing for breathtaking location shooting in greece, the monies might have been better spent working out a cohesive script with character development and motivations clearly outlined; especially since bill has gone through the trouble of doing this already."
positive;His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes.
negative;Don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do, even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy-laugh.
positive;"It's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality but it works as much as a statement in support of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's claims that ""all human communication is miscommunication""."
negative;Being a huge Laura Gemser fan, I picked this up at a rental outlet just to see another Emanuelle film.
positive;The first of the two DVD's is where the true magic is.
negative;The protagonist's goals are unclear, and are not very compelling.
negative;"She must have meant the poor slobs who shelled out 8 bucks hoping to see another ""Wrath of Khan,"" or at least a ""Voyage Home."""
negative;And what's with a Sikh being played with a Latino accent?
negative;and the whole audience is shocked and walks out of the theater like this is some kind of masterpiece.
positive;Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work.
negative;It all happens with so little flair that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
negative;Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he/she can write like Austen.
positive;Never before in Indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster.<br /><br />Not that I have not been a fan of Nana Patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee.
positive;I'm sure I'll quote the best scenes of the episode for the long time - they're just that good that they remain on the spectator's mind.
positive;In the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest.
positive;The black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today, even without any computer effects.
negative;This would make good fodder for them.
negative;Such is the case with Naqoyqatsi.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect when I saw it advertised.
negative;I give it a 2, only because (as the top of this review states) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was dead sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job.
negative;I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go.
negative;I complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie.
positive;This isn't an Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks.
positive;Few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character.
positive;Its major drawback is a static camera, and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is, which is a pity, for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking, made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems, and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention.
negative;He seems to play a slurring, laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction.
positive;Ouch!!!
positive;Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses.
negative;So be warned.
positive;It didn't matter.
positive;Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets.
positive;It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle.<br /><br />You can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in German! )
negative;The rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag.
positive;In this movie he doesn't play his usual character, the type that is in control, instead Geena Davis is in control and Sam is along for the ride.
positive;"The musical score was tracked in from Universal's ""Destination Unknown"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""The Black Cat"", and ""Werewolf of London""."
positive;The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention.
positive;I've decided that if I really enjoy a show, it's often the kiss of death.
positive;Also, there just wasn't much life in the film until it was nearly complete.
positive;"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims."
negative;Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ¬Ö well ¬Ö everyone else pretty much falls into that category.<br /><br />Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film?
positive;DO we exaggerate, Schultz?
negative;But this episode that features Mr Echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that I found myself tapping the fast forward button.
negative;I definatley didn't.
negative;I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better!
positive;I found her characterization dead-on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place.
positive;It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
negative;Just like that.
negative;This film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.
negative;Please do not support this franchise for not only your sake, but mine and everybody else's sake as well.
negative;I'm sure they wanted it to be all state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time.
positive;After the film was shown in the Salle Debussy, the 1,000 strong audience gave it a standing ovation for several minutes.
positive;This is a truly, must see film capturing as it does that very short period in western and in particular US times when the counter culture was about to bust itself wide open.
positive;This is where the humour derives from.
negative;Even my 12-year-old son said it was laughable.
negative;It was simply two hours of dress-up and could have been so much better.
positive;The imagery of this film which is closely related to the director's previous film Songs from the Second Floor is of utmost importance to the story, thus this story is told to a great degree by the surroundings and the environment in which the characters of Andersson's universe dwell and interact.
positive;He's got the sledgehammer out and he's drawn a bead on the side of your head.
positive;7/10<br /><br />Many differently edited and rated versions exist.
negative;"No big deal""."
negative;I mean, what the hell is this, a cheap sci fi movie or Henry James?
positive;Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging star/has-been road.<br /><br />Diane Baker is fine as naive, gullible April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy storyline, and film legend Joan Crawford chews her usual serving of scenery as Amanda Farrow, another role, like Jourdan's Savage, that Crawford likely took for the paycheck.<br /><br />There is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices (this IS 1959), and the predictability of the soap opera genre.
negative;Thus, this awful movie is utterly predictable, too--as if it wasn't bad enough.
positive;The facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great.
negative;";)<br /><br />xxx"
positive;<br /><br />There are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make, daily.
positive;She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.
negative;Not really worth watching unless you are hard up for TV time, or just have that thin of a DVD collection.
negative;The acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing.
negative;Peter Graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful, his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent.
positive;Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles, refused to see it.
positive;"A dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying ""the coffers were empty""."
positive;****SPOILERS**** Buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch & Bill Hickman.
positive;Are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position?
negative;I mean, like what the hell was VH1 thinking?
negative;All of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not-particularly-interesting countdown until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl.<br /><br />I suppose I must be a little jaded, but as a horror film fan, I'm left wondering why I should have bothered when I could easily have written a better screenplay myself.
positive;The turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting.
positive;Punk!
positive;By showing only the concequences of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children then become the main focus of the movie.
positive;<br /><br />As a whole the movie is good, much better then most martial art films in the drama department.
negative;Altman's Quintet has to be considered more than just flawed: As so many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in depicting those ideas, ought to work--and yet very little in this difficult film does.
positive;I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the boss.
negative;Waste of money.
positive;Sharky a narcotics detective mismanages up a bust of a drug dealer, causing the killing of some innocent bystanders, and gets demoted, literally transferred downstairs to vice, to deal with perverts, and other m misdemeanors that 'upstanding' cops consider latrine duty.
negative;"He never turns to his wife and says ""I think I want to be a congressman."""
positive;<br /><br />The character's are decently written onto the big screen.
positive;Whose life is it anyway?
negative;There was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring.
negative;the portrayals lacked passion & direction, leaving the viewer debating whether they should bother to care about the demise of the protagonists at all.
negative;In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire.
positive;He confronts Bule, who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day.
positive;Overall, a quiet type of movie with bursts of panic.
negative;It doesn't work.
negative;Sometimes it's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did.
positive;The humor arises from the characters and situations.
negative;Who cares?
positive;'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, although it is pretty ingenious at the same time as well.
negative;Eveytime I saw that kid just made me want slap he silly.
positive;"Much of the real humor comes from ""Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant Pavel."
positive;orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin (Don Stroud--in a very typical sort of role for him).
negative;The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost is!)
negative;I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please?
negative;This was obviously a low budget film.
negative;This does result in a cool inside joke, however, when Donald Pleasance screams to the screen at his own character.
negative;Most people get the luxury of typing in the title of a film, and finding out about the film before watching it but unfortunately I've just never been one of those kind of people.
positive;<br /><br />The visual gag everyone remembers is drunken Mr.Partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach.
negative;But the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up royally.
negative;All of a sudden the film takes a dramatic CGI filled turn that makes me shudder to think how it is a terrible waste of CGI.
negative;"Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was, in a word, ""insane""."
positive;The gem, the essence that is Mike Judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves.
negative;Instead they made probably the stupidest horror picture of the year!<br /><br />This movie starts with a bunch of art snob friends at a gallery.
negative;Hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble.
negative;Don't let the cover fool you, the costumes suck!
negative;This film was such a mess I actually reimbursed my friends who I dragged to see it.
negative;Segal is ready to kill her....<br /><br />Ummmm...THIS is a comedy?
positive;We all know even if MGM didn't.<br /><br />Highly recommended little gem.
positive;It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche.
positive;In case you couldn't tell, I guess.
positive;"To begin, I'd say that ""Water"" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels."
negative;Yet in the scenes on the roof, it appears to be in an industrial area with a steel mill belching smoke and flames.
negative;"I could sum up this movie, by quoting a very bad coach: ""Go out and try to score more points than the other guy."""
positive;I don't usually go for those feel good movies but I really enjoyed this one.
positive;This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe.
negative;if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't.
positive;Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more.
negative;An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago.
positive;This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story.
positive;This show is very underrated.
negative;As with Roeves, the CV says it all.
positive;Where Mockingbird leaves you with hope of that, rocking in the arms of Addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this movie leaves you just sad that pride from Black people might equal or better the pride of White people.
positive;Yesterday I finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie.
positive;There's subtle romance which is what I like, personally.
positive;This is a story about irony.
positive;Hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time, it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war.
negative;An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book.
positive;However, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), I loved this movie.
negative;After all, what have you got to lose?
positive;I have seen many of Shahrukh's movies and this is a very good role for him.
negative;It could have been a good movie, and the plot itself I don't see as male bashing, but certain specific references to men get really annoying.
positive;Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
positive;Everybody from the troopers to Joe Harmony knows that taking Tucsos to Fort Grant is asking to die.
positive;Geez, I can even still whistle the theme music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying myself to sleep a number of times!<br /><br />Only one other movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and that is the Wizard of Oz.
negative;Only watch this thing when it comes on as a MST 3000 Episode.
negative;They then landed on a twenty yard long dock in Africa.
negative;A better use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII.
negative;This is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex.
positive;Yashpal Sharma is detestable as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak.
positive;"Shot largely on location in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot--and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the All-American couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of ""the ugly American abroad"" about his personality; Day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage, has a suspicious nature."
negative;Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance.
positive;I cannot watch this film enough.
positive;Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
negative;And, having lived at least half a year in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one that is depicted in Michalkovs movie.
negative;I'm all for doing stuff that is edgy, that pushes the envelopes, but this simply didn't cut it.
negative;Arriving for the weekend are Pia's two daughters, one a short-haired lesbian and the other a brunette.
negative;The acting isn't particularly convincing, even given the amount of talent involved.
positive;So you're just left with the sadness that, whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not, Harper Lee's Mockingbird reflects.
negative;In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood cash-in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster.
positive;The wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage.
negative;This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
negative;The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747.
negative;This handbill is set in authentic Victorian type fonts, and looks *very* convincing.)
negative;"I found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator.<br /><br />""Hell Ride"", directed, written by and starring Larry ""Friend of QT"" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged."
negative;When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case.
positive;You know what it is when you're getting into it.
positive;This film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy.
positive;Most definitely.
positive;i was a huge fan of this series.
positive;Breathtaking genius.
positive;It makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
negative;"Maintain descent at 500 fpm""<br /><br />Bocelli: ""What?"
positive;When he's not a strange Other, he's a symbol, whose role isn't entirely worked out - at one point a savage brute, at another he epitomises nature and freedom.<br /><br />But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of primitivism before civilisation.
negative;Guess what happens at the end.
negative;now, this movie has no plot, or rather, there's something that tries to pass off as a plot: there's a mean hit-man (Willis) who is cool dangerous and sophisticated (actually he's none of those things, but from some dialog between the other characters, you are supposed to get this impression), so this hit-man is on a mission to kill someone, now there's an ex-IRA prisoner who is kind and nice and very likable (gear) who the FBI release from prison so he will help them.
positive;"Near the beginning of the movie, as the band of gypsies are traveling, there is a scene where the mules and women are loading, and an inter-title explains that ""the mules are the ones with long ears."""
negative;This movie is NOT the way.
negative;However, they know it's been done before many times so to make it different, let's do it very badly!
negative;Yet when the plane takes off it's clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767.

negative;He needed to be a little more of an American soldier and a lot less of a tribesman.
positive;<br /><br />The film begins with McKinley taking a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and asking him to be a special agent for him--and telling no one--not even the Secret Service.
negative;There is just something that tells you not to look...but you do.
positive;How often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out?
positive;The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation.
positive;In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like a Powell and Pressberger film, with nature a powerful, pantheistic character in its own right - alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful.
positive;"The acting is spot-on, John Williams' orchestrations are lush and Leslie Bricusse's songs memorable (""When I Am Older,"" ""You and I,"" ""Fill the World With Love,"" ""London Is London"" are just a few of the standouts."
positive;"My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed ""The Elegant Universe."""
positive;Though it isn't uncommon for str8 guys to have very close friendship with each other, but watch this film closely, it should be entering all sorts of gay film festivals and I would not be surprised that it may win itself a lot more awards toward this direction!
negative;Except this time there's Luke Perry too.
negative;The character names are the only things they kept, and even then they changed a few of those, and mixed them up, and changed Percy's relationships with them.

negative;It's about some kid who throws a party.
negative;One of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness.

positive;Those which we are blessed to be able to enjoy today in 1999, through this film lets us recognize the talents that existed then.
positive;And who doesn't want do be accepted my their peers?
negative;In the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident, which the audience can relate to, most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one.
positive;Thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions.
positive;One is initially very dependant upon the institution around him, the other is a rebel.
positive;The movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end.
negative;I came out of it feeling angry.
negative;I should have followed my instincts.<br /><br />I tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but I just couldn't.

positive;"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue""."
positive;I have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time.
negative;The only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves they truly are the stars and could out-act all but Guy Rolfe himself(he is the puppetmaster)and although you can see their wires and strings, they carry me throughout the painful start to finish of Retro-Puppet Master.
negative;"I was just waiting for this so called ""Dracula"" to fall in the ball pit at some time in the movie.<br /><br />7."
negative;<br /><br />Saved by the Bell almost seemed humorous compared to this.
negative;This films version of the familiar save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes beginning in the Pacific Northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire.

negative;"the plaaaain!"""
positive;Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy era.<br /><br />The film is also unusual in its casting--great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley.
negative;The movie portrays the Russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the Americans.
negative;however if someone's a Dino Morea fan, please go ahead and watch it.
positive;Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career).
positive;This is a superb TV series, it's sympathetic and for once realistic!
positive;I've lost count of the times I have seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny each time I see it.
negative;The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge.
positive;For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made.
positive;Coming at the end of the cycle of the Universal Monsters horror films, and before the Golden Age of sci-fi films, House of Dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more cheesy {read:enjoyable} elements which would come to typify the sci-fi films of the coming era.
negative;It all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast.
positive;It turns out that Dracula really didn't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse.
negative;"""Mod"" only meant young and integrated?"

positive;"As I write this ""Water"" is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year."
negative;if they're really lucky it might make the wal-mart $4.50 bin.
negative;Not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic (I get it, he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible.
negative;Had a great premise.
negative;Perhaps to non-Australian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue, but to the native it is merely tedious.<br /><br />Anyone who lives here knows Broken Hill is a rough, tough isolated mining town.
positive;Young John Wayne scores easily in his first starring role with a natural delivery the rest of the cast can't command.
positive;"<br /><br />However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour."
positive;It doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting.
negative;"But, with his love fulfilled, Hayakawa loses his ability to paint¬Ö <br /><br />An introduction notes, ""'The Dragon Painter' was originally released in 1919 by the Haworth Pictures, a Hollywood-based production company formed the previous year by Sessue Hayakawa, a Japanese-born actor who enjoyed great popularity in the silent period."
negative;O'Toole and Rampling are good, and so are some others.
negative;"However, the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1/100th of ""The Fast and the Furious's"", and the time limit was unforgiving."
positive;Add Bert Glennon's superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of Americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than Ford.
negative;Ruggero Deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975.
negative;For example, William H. Macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention.
positive;I have great liking for good comics like the Orgazmo,Cheech n chong, Monty Python series and many others but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies.
negative;Just one question.....Who CAN'T cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens.
negative;"Visually it isn't too special either, although it has its moments (for example the female creature with the ""death powder"" who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sh!t throughout) and it certainly has an industrial-y feeling to it."
negative;"""Chupacabra Terror"" is saved from a '1"" by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine."
negative;<br /><br />I thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part.
positive;It had it all--music, stories, a talking squirrel, and chuckling daisies.
negative;I was looking forward to see Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved Step by step.
negative;Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could, but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving, deceptive spy.
positive;I was surprised.<br /><br />No strike that last sentence , I wasn`t surprised I was shocked .
negative;There's nary a monster in sight for the greater part of the film, barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horror-related.
positive;"However, this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us, straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all, that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting, we see a new vision of WWII."
positive;A golden globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize at Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-write, edits and puts music to a high caliber drama, he has pull it off¬Ö what about some Science Fiction now?
negative;Folks!
negative;I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced.
positive;Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible.<br /><br />Somehow, this film got lost.
negative;Film critics of the world, I apologize.
negative;I thought he had reformed... but since when are these TV spin offs loyal to the original *rolls eyes*.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but there is nothing redeemable about this... at all.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
positive;The movie was funny, yet touching.
positive;It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is Hollywood after all, and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.<br /><br />Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer.
negative;Now that's a lamest excuse ever to become a Christian if you ask me!<br /><br />This movie still tries to convert non-believers using scare tactics.
negative;However, the movie stands up very well without Neil (although he handles himself very well in this movie, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters).
positive;The film gives the audience the advantage of watching Jim's transformation along with Leila.
negative;No actually I'm lying: I'm GLAD it isn't!
positive;Some characters are underwritten ... That's that!
negative;Now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust.
negative;Oh, and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place.
positive;ONCE again this JAP SAP cartoon is nothing like any of that.
positive;And specifically ,I was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to New Orleans?
positive;Anyone who has ever seen newsreels of Hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature.
negative;This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects.
positive;"Every performance (including that of Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in ""Dogma."""
negative;Some, a handful.
negative;Only three words are really required for this review: Piece of crap.<br /><br />If you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money.
positive;Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here.
positive;I would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end.
positive;It is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity.
negative;Scary, I know.
positive;Nigel Bruce's characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note.
positive;Watching the film made me want to book a flight for Istanbul right away.<br /><br />Great footage of Ceza, a Turkish rapper.
negative;This movie was released in all major cinemas in Australia.
positive;The characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closeness--the camera pulls out and away, sound disappears, words are lost, only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars.
positive;"So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like ""Step into Liquid"" and ""Billabong Odyssey""."
positive;The open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end.
negative;The camera work was non pleasing itself.
positive;Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe.<br /><br />Does the movie oversimplify the issues?
negative;Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized.
positive;10/10.
negative;The only one whose acting was great, was Diane Lane.
negative;"I muttered something along the lines of ""Okay...whatever."""
positive;The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful.
positive;"The scenery is terrific, the characters good and anyone like ""Leonard Maltin"" who considers the Bacharach music awful must be completely deaf!"
positive;Some very important questions.
positive;Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fussier (a pity) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin.
positive;This is a quiet,understated film that is lovely to look at (the occasional,but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure),while the screenplay is well written.
positive;In an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment.
positive;<br /><br />While I am not a big fan of the New Urbanism, my criticism of it is because of its small vision.
negative;If there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both.
positive;Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, able to evoke a jealous passion that I've never seen from him.
negative;agony.
positive;Camille Natta is absolutely gorgeous.
positive;"That film, while the premiere ""film noir"" and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair."
positive;Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere!
negative;No, not one.
negative;"The partially fogged camera lens--I remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit I've ever seen--never allowed me to get ""into"" the film's world.<br /><br />In general there are serious problems with the mise-en-scene employed here."
positive;to defend and expand the empire.
negative;Lame!
negative;<br /><br />It's not a total waste.
negative;As the exchange develops, Herzog draws out of the man a confession: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place.
negative;I really don't have time to write reviews but I felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff.
negative;The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy.
positive;Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths.
positive;At the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all, the movie makes you feel something, you may even learn a thing or two.
positive;Dustin Hoffman was way too outstanding, I can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well.
positive;Everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another, and no one is all good or all bad.<br /><br />There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy, Ann's as listed above - and there is one uniting lie - the accident, about which all parties keep quiet.
negative;Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad.
negative;She loves me but is growing impatient with me because I'm always wrapped up in my scientific work.
negative;A cowboy known only as 'the stranger'(Karel Roden)finds a dead man(Kilmer) that he thinks is a wanted man.
positive;Now more accessible on DVD in widescreen, this film is a must for fans of '70s horror fare.
negative;His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact.
positive;One of the better musical bios.
positive;It's definitely worth it.
negative;The girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot.
positive;The wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in Paris.<br /><br />This is a charming film.
negative;"I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.<br /><br />I went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of African musical - since people break into song every few minutes.<br /><br />None of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a ""tune."
positive;This one did exactly that.
negative;I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device.
positive;The splendid performances of Ford's stock company, (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell etc), adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full-bodied star performance is Joanne Dru's Denver.
positive;"Humor(not unlike that of ""Fast times"" ), Drama, and a GREAT GREAT soundtrack.<br /><br />I personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this, it would give an idea about the journey their about to embark on."
negative;The actors/actresses beside Reba are OK so I feel bad for them stucking in a so-called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world (Reba).To sum up , I suggest this TV Show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
negative;Yes, and no.
positive;The camera was always in the right place.
positive;People in the US have known for a long time that Showtime is the new HBO, they are making far better cutting edge, powerful shows and this is no exception.
positive;"Just like in Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, when somebody says ""Last night I had a dream"", you get to watch it."
positive;The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special.
positive;For example I wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it, let alone a killer one.
positive;"Even the Maria Montez/Jon Hall technicolored baubles of the '40s are eclipsed by ""Princess of the Nile,"" Fox's entry in Hollywood's mid-'50s obsession with things Egyptian (see ""Land of the Pharoahs,"" ""Valley of the Kings,"" etc.)"
positive;"""Beyond Rangoon"" is simply marvelous."
negative;It seems the screenwriters didn't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence.
negative;Its like the director literally took a s*** in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is horrendous, The plot is so dumb, and the deaths of each character is laughably bad.
negative;There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them.
negative;"The space carrot from Venus in It Conquered the World is still officially the worst, most laughable monster I've ever seen grace the screen, but the Cormans always manage to deliver when it comes to bad, cheesy looking monsters.<br /><br />They also managed to deliver on their other trademarks as well; i.e."
positive;"Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even if they are cloaked in humorous trappings for wider palatability.<br /><br />OUR liberal stupidgencia (the antithesis of intelligencia) may not see themselves this way; but for this sort of behavior, they are no more than Neo Nazi Book burners.<br /><br />PLEASE, allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both Historical and Humorous.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!"
negative;As crazy as it sounds, that last one, WASN'T a joke!
positive;It allows a glimpse into the private moments of the family involved in the most trying time of their lives.
negative;He goes to his uncle's house and rounds up some people and throws a party.
positive;"The various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen ""Tramp"" and ""Dalmatians."""
positive;"Unfortunately, many great films on IMDb such as this one have their scores ""adjusted"" by IMDb."
negative;However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone.
positive;I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story.
positive;The Story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more.
negative;Why does Steven dress up like he is from a Western movie?
negative;I will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me.<br /><br />The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process.
negative;The episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes, but oh no Jesse doesn't want this.
positive;The hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy.
positive;"Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both deliver wonderful performances (Leung won the prize for best actor at Cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.<br /><br />The above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless, ""dizzyingly romantic,"" and, in a word, magical."
positive;Trust me, I don't go around giving a 10 to every thing that I watch.
positive;Overall as far as movies go, I've seen better, but as far as animal attack horror films(a genre I get easily scarred at) it's one of the better ones you'll see.
negative;Finally after all that waiting we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark.
negative;Simple, but quite offensive, really.
negative;The filming is nicely done, the music is really good, but nothing more.<br /><br />See it only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds, or have a lot of time to spare.
positive;She seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the Head of Intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it all.
negative;I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty.
positive;The actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week.
positive;The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana.
negative;But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt.
negative;Once Upon A Time In China, Shogun Assassin, A Chinese Ghost Story and even Big Trouble In Little China are my favorites but this film sucked!
positive;The film is a documentary about one of Japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on.
positive;"I've read ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"" when I was in high school, and found myself completely engrossed in her story, and also in the Broadway play of her life in the Secret Annexe.<br /><br />However, I'm a little perplexed about how people have perceived her diary and of her as a person, seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world."
positive;The children's reaction is hilarious ¬ñ providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout.
negative;He gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the divers.<br /><br />But once you get going, it's not a bad story line.
negative;"I can imagine them brainstorming about making a film where ""everything would, like, turn to ***t and people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because Finnish people are so notoriously depressed, too, and their self-esteem is so bad"", which brings us to the fact that...<br /><br />- The film is loaded with clich√©s, mostly about ""the Finnish mentality""."
positive;I was/am/will be continuously stunned by this film.
positive;I loved it then & I still love it.
positive;The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling.
positive;Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor.
positive;He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight.
negative;There's still plenty of worse duds like Norbit and Death Proof.
negative;This one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film.
positive;We would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do anything about it?
negative;"This scene, short and sweet, gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when Korine and co. were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him, in real life, a lasting, overwhelming guilt.<br /><br />Henceforth, the film is hit-and-miss; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous, muddled narrative."
positive;Try to have as little distraction as possible.
negative;Too much fancy tricks and stupid story.<br /><br />4/10
positive;Before I saw this version, Shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and I never tried to understand the Elizabethan English.
negative;The Filipino resistance wants them to take their time.
negative;You will recognize Chris Penn, whose biggest cinematic impact is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa, whose career peaked at 'Casper'.
negative;I am not quite sure I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel.
positive;A lot of people have the belief that Koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was God.
negative;It can also move the pregnant astronaut around as though he were Pinnochio.
negative;But don't worry.
negative;I wondered if this was meant to be a comedy.
negative;Utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception.
positive;What appeared clever in the written page, doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera.
positive;"Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course)and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of B horror films known as ""The Loose Limbs"" series."
positive;I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific.
positive;Not to mention, it's by the group that did Rugrats.
positive;And I must admit, this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.
positive;Shot on a shoestring in Manhattan and in his acting workshop on ad hoc sets, Shadows was the culmination of months of improvisational rehearsals, in which the (mostly amateur) actors developed bonds with one another, invented their characters, and polished their techniques to give their filmed performances just the right tenor of spontaneous familiarity.
positive;"At this point we hear ""Help!"
positive;Production is first rate as well.<br /><br />Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
positive;I'm a scout for the Army.
negative;c&j is one of the sweetest films I've ever seen without becoming diabetic.<br /><br />It's OK if you do like it, but realize that EVERYTHING in this film is a direct rip-off.<br /><br />The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything by forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That Sinking Feeling.
negative;"No ""Hey, how you doing?"
negative;"Replies another, guffawing, ""No, it means it's night time."""
negative;Yeah, right!
negative;My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle.
positive;"The damage was already done; for the first time in decades, smallpox stalked the streets of New York."
negative;"An American ""deserter"" (I had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the Philippines as their desperate escape by raft to Borneo is not your classic desertion)."
positive;Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound.
positive;Without giving too much away, it is a very worthwhile series to watch.
positive;Sure, Slaughter is a tough, gun-toting, Black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys--and a very good action picture at that.<br /><br />For the second and final time, Jim Brown plays the title character.
negative;You never say a demon's name out loud, Ryan informs the wide eyed Co-Ed who dare inquires.<br /><br />Well, how very very convenient for you.
positive;Remember, this was pre-cable!
negative;I never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland.
positive;There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling.
positive;"I don't quite understand why Roger Corman reworked the original so much and released it on the American market under a different title (""Screamers""), because there are very few elements open for improvement."
negative;It must have been produced on a budget of pocket change.
positive;"Not since ""Steel Magnolias"" have I been moved to tears by a film."
positive;"Michael is a very ""human angel"" (If their is such)."
positive;I would recommend it, but not for kids.
negative;"One of the most notorious of the banned ""Video Nasties"" of the 1980s is also one of the most excessively over-hyped."
positive;I absolutely hate the idea of made for television films .
negative;Instead, I got this bore fest by amateur auteur Andy Milligan.
negative;The story, who cares?
positive;Either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
positive;In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always.
negative;"""<br /><br />Rating this ""episode"" against usual theatre releases, the story was...well, I'm not sure I should even say because I'm not sure there was one."
negative;It is not an homage.
negative;I am astounded that Lions Gate/Maple agreed to release this movie on DVD.
positive;I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for a grape when they're sitting on the porch, and He tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch.
negative;There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.
negative;However all this changes... and you still won't care.
positive;Plus, the writing is very witty and make this a nice romantic-comedy.
negative;A life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out.
positive;A scar of love, destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life.
negative;I better go rent some tonight.
positive;See it again.
positive;Thumbs up!
negative;The novel however, really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could.
negative;"There are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of, but the story is similar in some ways to ""London"".<br /><br />*Possible Spoiler Warning* American kids go to foreign country, one falls in love with a beautiful girl."
negative;If you tried really hard.
negative;You don't expect a whole lot.
positive;Hell to pay is a must see movie!!!
positive;Back in January of 98 though, I attended the Second Annual Quentin Tarantino film fest held in Austin,Texas.
negative;On top of that, he is a comic book character---no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development.
negative;"And what's worse, Weber made lots of money off of it, and poor Johnson is going to have serious ""issues"" the rest of his life."
negative;Watch it once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.
positive;Tony Alva.
positive;"""The love of his life"" (she has no name in the movie) refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin."
positive;anyway, the concept of the mach 5 spawned so many 'ultra-multi-function-special-cars' but none were able to surpass its genius in construction.
negative;The movie was fundamentalist Christian propaganda.
negative;"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set, under the title ""The Broken Skull."""
negative;Avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things, or see another Perry Mason actor in a B movie.<br /><br />4/10
negative;This movie fails miserably on every possible level, not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances, dime-store special effects, an irritating musical score, and, most of all, a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense.
negative;"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep."
positive;I don't think I would pay $20 for it on a bet, but my wife might.
positive;We also meet the dastardly Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas, and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum.
positive;The reaction shots of Leila at the dinner table on her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late to dinner again) eats salted scallions with gusto and pushes bride-and-groom dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect.<br /><br />The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by Elliott Dexter as Jim, Leila's neglectful husband.
negative;It simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a made-for-TV-like style movie with one exception.. it was probably rated-R.
positive;So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments.
positive;The music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage all over..Dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world.
positive;This is a another winner for the western genre.
negative;This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen!
negative;And another funny scene when a rotting corpse, played by Julie Bowen, attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out, had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />But as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original.
negative;A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with.
negative;I always enjoyed seeing real life Husband and Wife teams star in the same movie .
positive;His forte was drama--and I guess this movie is a drama of sorts--just set in the old West.
negative;A snore gore.
positive;I don't think that was the original intention of her diary.
negative;Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor.
positive;The film sets its tone of creepiness and Gothic horror right from the titles, as it shows real battleground shots from the war, while Eastwood's voice is heard quietly singing a funereal song of the time.<br /><br />The opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character, and the tone of the entire movie.
positive;"After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally registered with IMDB just so I could give Farscape a ""10."""
negative;Dr. Edelmann doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural, yet before long he's medically treating Dracula and watching Larry Talbot change into the Wolfman while hardly blinking an eye.
negative;This film would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral, and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been, but it's not.
positive;This is an amazingly well-filmed early talkie adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play.
positive;"The most entertaining section of the game is Ship Combat, and the sword ""fights"" that follow."
negative;The Biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and I honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children.
negative;You know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is Lance Henriksen.
negative;Go back and get the correct one, short-sighted gimp.<br /><br />As I said, I was all ready to fast-forward to the good parts, safe in the knowledge that I wasn't missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler.
negative;gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat.
negative;The film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or some other cheap type of film) and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later.
positive;"Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the leading role, showing obstinate resilience in the face of unimaginable torment; by the film's end, she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face."
positive;The Railway Children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast,the warm,humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful English countryside.
positive;The film actually concludes before Dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior.
negative;It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are.
positive;I was completely blown away.
positive;Great for mixed company, 18+ crowd.<br /><br />Nice production, not a cheap budget, well organized, and keeps your interest.
negative;he should have retired longtime ago instead of making a fool of himself and loosing all the self respect.
negative;Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film.
positive;Dennis Morgan is great as the singer/composer Chauncey Olcutt.
negative;At firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model...
positive;The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense.
positive;Although it is cynical, it isn't overly so.
positive;Lance believes his men can thwart them until the relief column arrives.
negative;Simply because it will suck the life right out of you.<br /><br />Vampire Effect is an insult to movie-buffs everywhere.
negative;Give me a break!<br /><br />The plot is ludicrous.
positive;For anybody bored with run of the mill cinema, with a wacky sense of humour you MUST SEE THIS FILM.
negative;In defending him, she comes across a wooden doll of Pinnochio.
negative;I have lost interest in ever again supporting Dutcher in an LDS-themed movie with a ticket purchase.
positive;I have looked for this movie on so many sites and stores.
negative;And I don't know about anyone else, but if someone was slicing off pieces of my person and eating them I wouldn't just lie there and look distressed.<br /><br />My problem with the film might be that I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a filmmaker, and again this could have been directed by anybody.
positive;Other examples we've enjoyed include: A Box Full of Moonlight, Pieces of April, Delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy.
negative;Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest.
positive;"Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.<br /><br />What makes ""Rendition"" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches."
negative;Looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male I wasn`t too impressed and William Baldwin does go way over the top
positive;So, Slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials.
positive;"Aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself, after Warner Bros. picked his three-act play, ""The Wax Works"", to create the 1933 horror film, ""Mystery of the Wax Museum""."
positive;"Subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a hustler being altered by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly fine film debut) who simply wants to be loved; by an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; by the trust Father Chris instills in both Pip and Clark in a good shepherd's manner: and by a flashback to the car accident where Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act at the hands of his father, just before the accident, but failed to do so, opening his deep guilt and resultant misplaced anger, mirrored by his grandfather's taped experiences."
positive;Her transition really became her and she molded into her role very well.
positive;I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work.
negative;"In between two sequences, the address the viewer and ""explain"" why we love horror so much."
negative;"She should have rewritten the role so the ""crack whore"" would win.<br /><br />Those people who have compared this film to Natural Born Killers, take note: Tarantino made the characters of Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, yet sympathetic."
positive;Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up.
negative;What was his reason for being there?<br /><br />How in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve?
negative;That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory.
positive;Plus I just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump, but instead the actual movie.
negative;The fact that this movie was made should give any young<br /><br />aspiring film maker hope.
positive;!!!!
positive;When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an S.I.S.
negative;They must have been put together in someones' sleep.
negative;You know?
positive;The first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came.
negative;even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing,nauseating indeed.
negative;I couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people.
negative;The cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that.
positive;The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick.
positive;People may think me terribly queer, but I think there are moments when one can identify with Meethi as well!
negative;This film is terrible - honestly.
negative;"Carrot Top's ""Chairman of the Board"" and his AT&T commercials are living proof that fly-blown fecal matter is available in the color orange."
positive;The Music and Musical references are hilarious and Awesome.
positive;I could watch it over and over again.
positive;By the time Takashi Miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued Hollywood Remake Machine working full steam ahead.
negative;A socialist mayor agreed to a deal, a nicely timed election arrived, and a communist mayor was elected, who turned it down, much to the exasperation of the American wine execs...<br /><br />hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original..
negative;Otherwise stick to the facts.
negative;Geez.
positive;Stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world.
negative;I'm not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive Bigfoot.
positive;As it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark.
positive;Why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot?
positive;As it is, they need to get Tucsos to another post.
positive;Unless I am incorrect.
positive;He becomes terribly drunk, and Helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he won't let her drive.
positive;The chair.
negative;I love these awful 80's summer camp movies.
negative;And the whole premise of putting an ex-con in charge of a bunch of kids just doesn't seem realistic in this day and age.
positive;The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.
positive;The whole movie is about how Danglard's concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show--how the audience demands devotion--and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero, while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men.
negative;The enemy bashes his head in with much celebration.
positive;It dwells on the waste, and on various specimens of destruction (fire, smoke, wrecked vehicles).
positive;Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this TV series.
positive;"The characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle."
positive;Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda.
negative;The only actor of any note in this was James Woods, and his part was peripheral at best.
negative;Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable.
positive;C'mon girls..when he has no shirt on and goes to get water I know your mouth dropped.
positive;This makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera-man-must-be-sh%#@ing-his-pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so.<br /><br />Far more enjoyable than the big-budget re-made garbage being released by Hollywood today.<br /><br />See it.
positive;Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look?
negative;I mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet.
positive;"Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.<br /><br />When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now""."
positive;i think that is why this film is so special.
positive;But just to be safe...
positive;This story never would have worked in a small or suburban school.
positive;Porter Hall has a great role as the murdered man's father.
negative;Seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy, but that's about as intriguing as it gets.
negative;I wouldn't even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers but there are two sides to that because if you ignore such warnings and even give a film a chance after it has flopped in theatres, you're entering at your own risk and might just end up with a bad taste in your mouth which is exactly how I feel about this stupid movie.<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing good about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap are some of it songs (and seriously excluding the title track).
negative;There are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies.
positive;The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.
positive;But then, what is Benes's whole story?
negative;Unfortunately, that is what I got.
positive;The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
positive;"He looks an awful lot like Shrek."""
positive;If you missed the first one I advise you watch next weeks, 9PM, BBC 2
negative;Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity.
positive;Enjoy John Waters' finest movie, but only see it if you're an open-minded individual with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will gross you out.
positive;Later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out.
negative;He also has a daughter along, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon.
positive;I didn't know what to expect when I first put it in the VHS player, but from the opening scene, to the exploding train set, to Perks birthday, Jeffries proved that he could handle the most child-friendly story with ease.
negative;Check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing, then by all means watch it.
negative;I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller off John Hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor.
negative;At least, I think so.
positive;With a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet, providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.
positive;A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.
positive;The terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes.
negative;The homosexual encounter was pure speculation.
positive;Charles Mingus's largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living by the moment, a mantra by which Cassavetes worked and seemingly lived.
negative;The plot, such as it is, has been done before a trillion times so there is no need to recount any of it.
positive;THE FEELING of the need to have someone play the role of Arbiter of Public Taste and Political Correctness always manages to get under our skin.
positive;It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father.
negative;"Aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie, so he just made up some half-assed non-""story"" centering around a band he particularly likes (or maybe they're his friends) because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters.<br /><br />Erice: First off, I've never heard of this guy before ¬ñ and now I know why."
negative;I can only hope Emma Thompson decides to do a film of Pride and Prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds.<br /><br />The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside.
positive;I was about 17 years old at the time.
negative;<br /><br />Kaige: The Chinese story has a solid premise.
positive;Corrina, a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is.
negative;Nothing was based on reality, I doubt things would progress as they did in this film.
positive;We can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in.
negative;I readily admit that I might feel differently about this film if I did.
negative;The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are.
positive;"When asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select ""You don't need to see my identification."""
negative;"I'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.<br /><br />Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.<br /><br />Characters are unlikeable, design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.<br /><br />And the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is ""What the F$*K is going on?!"""
positive;There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country, it is all praise and thanks.
negative;It's not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursion was NOT buried in a file labeled National Interest, Defense de Toucher.
negative;This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around Adam's inabilities and seizures.
positive;We are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor.<br /><br />Considering the era in which 'K√∂rkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb.
negative;"He is often accompanied on ""investigations"" by hot co-eds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera."
negative;"The blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like that of ""Kill Bill""."
negative;I'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct, because they manage to criticize U.S. wars in Afghanistan and particularly Iraq by suggesting that the U.S. does war well, but doesn't clean up afterward, thus sowing the seeds for future trouble.
positive;Enter two music aficionados, Judy and Edna, who love to hear the band play conducted by one of their grandfathers.
negative;Although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it.
negative;Tarzan is primarily a love story.
negative;What a pathetic waste of time, money and effort!
positive;Actually, for a while I thought he was Steve Guttenberg from Police Academy (1984).
positive;It wasn't until the United States was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes.
negative;The dog is the best in this movie as well.
negative;1) There were view admirable characters throughout the movie.
positive;I bought this movie long time ago, and I do not regret buying it.
positive;This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!
negative;When you chat with someone you CAN track their IP address.
negative;I saw this on Sci-Fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting.
positive;"<br /><br />Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in ""A price above rubies""."
negative;It has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad film even worse.
negative;It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music.
positive;"It's a clever, Chaplinesque band of criminals, the leader of whom, Lillas Pastia, has ""spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking he might be offered a job in politics."""
negative;This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment.
negative;Uh-huh.<br /><br />I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings.
negative;I am not kidding.
negative;"Here, Laura plays ""Laura"" (original, huh?)"
positive;I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version.
positive;Lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better.
positive;It is even said that man maybe crawled out or slivered out of the waters many millennium ago.
positive;The predictable gags work and the animation is great and pretty original at times.
positive;It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s.
negative;I watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat to the TV set rather than watch this rubbish again.
negative;The wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while Masters, who supposedly can barely fly, puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops.
negative;Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century, The Turk, and shots of Deep Blue, hinting that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human as well.
negative;some weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so.
positive;Some of them don't work, but most do, and well.
positive;As the psychiatrist explains, one cannot, with any modicum of conviction or certainty, say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia, to the fore.
positive;The idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone NOT laugh!!!
negative;While this certainly makes for a pleasurable b-movie on the surface, the traditionally tiresome acting, direction, and script will have all but Asian horror buffs shaking their heads in dismay.
negative;"I have WEAPONS!"""
negative;"But a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation....""Last Year at Marienbad"" comes to mind."
negative;<br /><br />I've read books and watched news programs about him and, now I'm not a screenwriter or anything, but I believe there's enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented.
negative;However, instead of a well-knit cast of a few, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clich√© characters...<br /><br />1.
negative;WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY GO???
positive;There is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie.
negative;The movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so.
positive;Most of the acting is horrible, and WAY over the top, but that's exactly what I expect in a movie like this.
negative;No way I would go out of my way to watch it.
positive;It's nice to see it ended on a high note.
negative;Not even a small cameo appearance.
negative;You know.
positive;The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on Starewicz's old style of puppetry.
positive;"The main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs (with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George ""Goober"" Lindsey"")."
negative;Then we've got the Hideous Dynamic Duo of Sulu and Chekov, hiking through the woods together... probably en route to a Barry Manilow concert.
positive;The story is an interesting one and for Stewards' fans compelling to say the least.
negative;Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst films I have ever seen, it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made.
negative;They smuggle opium.
negative;Boy, what a waste of time... More cheese than Wisconsin!!
positive;That is unless Caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced.
negative;I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after seeing this movie!
negative;Much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room.
negative;Next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right.
positive;The second serial looks better but simply does not equal this one.
negative;Things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mum's sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead.
positive;To those who read this comment.
positive;The same locations are used over and over again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways.
negative;He promised his father on his death bed that he would NEVER send their senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home.
negative;It almost succeeds as science fiction.
negative;Life on which planet, exactly?
negative;possibly.
negative;They could at least have chosen a likely town, or a likely forest, but nothing even SEEM like Brittany nor Rennes... And calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience.
positive;"My cousin use to do a very accurate impression of Giant Robot (he pronounced it ""Giant Robutt."")"
negative;"But do avoid ""Supernova"" as I can assure you that you're not THAT bored."
negative;""", because I saw the first one obviously, and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot?"
positive;it's a nice, good, and sometimes funny film.<br /><br />if you don't try, you can't say it's bad.
positive;OH!
positive;A look at a true, tell it like it is, logging, mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development.
positive;John Boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state, and physical predicament.
positive;I give it a 7.
positive;): the idealism, the hope, the freedom, the confusion, the betrayals, and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement.
negative;A female vice-president.
positive;[Harry Crystal]<br /><br />Nothing beats a great stage show ... nothing!
negative;I know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made, much less sold and distributed, and for that I commend these folks.
positive;(hey - Duchovny - where's the day-old donuts??
negative;Go see anything else that's playing.
negative;This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me.
positive;It has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority, i.e.
positive;When you start watching the movie, don't do anything else!
negative;Much to the chagrin of the kids, the parents accede to the plan, even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart.
negative;"He also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire puns/metaphors to put one off the word ""fire"" for life.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so lucky."
positive;The two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing.
negative;It's clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design, but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world.
positive;(CIA?NSA?Homeland Sec?)
positive;This may seen contrived or heavy handed: it is not.
negative;At this point you will be treated to drab scenery, and illogical, boring fight scenes.
negative;To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce.
negative;Whatever Jonas Quastel's trick is, it worked.
positive;Also a very convincing & disturbing depiction of Tourete's syndrome
negative;This surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity!
negative;"""Jack Brooks"" isn't."
negative;The human factor, the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over.
positive;Due to the educational history in music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., this movie alone belongs to the people of this country.<br /><br />I viewed this movie recently.
positive;Scamp meets another dog called Angel, they both get along fine and do the things scamp's mother and father did, having an italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs etc:)Afterwards, Scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal, which is the baby, scamp comes back and Angel is joined in the family.
positive;Ingmar Bergman penetrating, existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland dealing with surviving a long war.
negative;"Of course, it could be anybody, since the only characteristics of The Homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the ""normal"" folks."
positive;"Far from the greatness of classic ""10""s such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite up to the ""9""s one might give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10; perhaps a 7."
negative;But then again how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even hollywood won't.
negative;It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on.
positive;Much to her surprise, Jane finds herself attracted to Tom.<br /><br />Holly Hunter is doing a great performance as the perky journalist.
positive;"Yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an ""after school special"", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience."
negative;The original is annoying enough to begin with, but this guy really is torture to watch.
negative;These people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix.
negative;His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava.
negative;At least you could laugh AT Plan 9 From Outer Space.
positive;It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry.
positive;"Just as predictably, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lance's decision to take the Indian back sets things into action.<br /><br />Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of ""Union Station"") surprises Lance when he tells him he should have shot Tucsos."
negative;It will be more entertaining and have better production values.
positive;Criminally, he wasn't even nominated.
positive;was the campers' greeting, usually met with the equally inane 'Ho-De-Ho!.
negative;The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad.
negative;Completely agree with other review.<br /><br />I watched this movie for about 5 minutes.
negative;This is a poor quality Asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women's wombs almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images.
positive;Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, anti-Semite.
negative;World at War is based on the meeting he has with Buck in the book series.<br /><br />The problem is - this film is as awful as the first two.
positive;Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others.
positive;Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean, if you have been to Korea or have Korean friends, you should know what i mean.
negative;But you pundits keep on trying.
negative;Some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way.
positive;The friendships that develop are universally true, anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make.
negative;Despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that Pete's Meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama.
negative;I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem himself.
negative;This one was not finished when they let it out...
positive;The music is impacting.
negative;I rented this film because I enjoy watching things with Lauren Graham in them.
negative;with such blatant self-importance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity, but COMICALLY bereft of profundity.
negative;It is so poorly done and no where close to dramatic, artsy, complex, well written, well preformed, or even bearable.
positive;Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack!
negative;Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose.
positive;I am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce.
negative;This loops about and several characters dies or come back to life, but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot.
positive;I think this one needs a chance to go on, and I will definitely be waiting for it.
negative;"At the time of ""Two-fisted tales"" he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet."
positive;It is what all Matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet.
negative;That is indeed what it is.
positive;"In reply to ""State of Confusion"" The dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly, but that may have only been an error in continuity."
positive;Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance take Tucsos to Fort Grant because Drum cannot spare Lance.
positive;The only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by Alec Guinness.
negative;This movie was a big disappointment.
positive;Go see it.
positive;<br /><br />If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on, you should watch this cartoon.
positive;Stroud is great--scary and nasty to the core, but Ed MacMahon as the boss?!
negative;But I didn't buy for a second that THAT girl worked in a steel yard.
positive;"And here they are.<br /><br />""Confirmed Dead"" is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues."
positive;That would be so cool!!!!
negative;I would Love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re-do this film right,because at the heart of this silly film is a great western.---I would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing.
negative;"In one instance we have John-John trying to have the ""biggest party of the decade"" while also trying to score a record deal (ok, kinda reminds me of the original House Party), but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, Grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer."
positive;"I decided to see ""Ray"", trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar of Best Lead Actor."
positive;Actually he is creamed by Mae Busch because he lied to her while Stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife.<br /><br />Here Harry's wife (Alice Ward) is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control.
negative;"May be a good candidate for the next generation of ""Mystery Science Theatre."""
positive;After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally cleans up his act, shaving off his mustache, working out to lose the middle-aged spread, and dressing neatly.
positive;She gives him also no love but only stability.
positive;The camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups, it is a dancing camera.
positive;"He took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks, and in one memorable episode Fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out: ""Lies, Ted!"
positive;"He did not frolic with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight off ""Indian"" snake charmers with a tennis racket."
negative;"And with well written dialogue including lines like ""the only difference between you and me Rico, is I'm alive and your dead,"" this movie is truly a masterpiece."
positive;That was really cool.
negative;I was 17, and my three buddies and I laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash.
negative;Nothing.
positive;She is a hard-nosed journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all of her time to TV news show.
positive;Just doesn't fit.
positive;"We do understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best of friends...but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece...it can be seen as a bit campy at times...a little over the top at points (kinda on a 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' level to me..) and honestly I can identify with the ""teddy bear"" scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men/careers, et al..so its not as over the top as it seems....!"
negative;"The main reason why I overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known, but fundamental (foreign) titles endlessly focusing on ""Halloween""."
negative;"A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of ""Don't be so damn stupid in the first place."""
negative;The following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant, including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion.
positive;the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, see some of the promo videos, and meet the band...although i *still* dont know how they can cope with wearing those masks all the time!
positive;I won't spoil more, but the scenes following the bathtub moment, with them two, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.<br /><br />The plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment.
negative;Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu.
negative;I wish it did because then it would've taken the tension away from the jealous love triangle.
negative;I hope he has improved a million-fold!
positive;Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
positive;Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly-written, badly-acted Lizzie McGuire episode.
positive;However, as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out, they take on multiple dimensions and depth.<br /><br />Most interesting of all is Sutherland's character of Nelson.
negative;And look at the cast.
positive;You will not, therefore, be insulted by this film.
positive;I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.
negative;Personally it was too far fetched for me.
negative;"I haven't seen it yet, but I sincerely hope Burton didn't look for inspiration and/or stylish trademarks in good old Andy Milligan's ""Bloodthirsty Butchers""."
positive;See this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense.
negative;This is a far cry from his work on Night of the Demons and Witchboard, which are decent outings but nothing to write home about.
negative;"If you're into scream-queens, chases by vile murderers and that sort of things, ""Terror in the Aisles"" has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences."
negative;There are also three writers responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game that's still in production.
negative;Since when does an octopus have fangs?
negative;"In ""The Box"", not much has changed.<br /><br />I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been, and I bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of Richard ""Twilight Zone"" Matheson's old short stories.<br /><br />Big mistake!"
positive;Every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character.
positive;After all, don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams?
negative;Dracula McCloud?
negative;YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!
negative;As it sits, the people who made this film are facists themselves, and should perhaps move into a communist enclave where propagandizing is accepted.
negative;Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat.
negative;WHERE WAS THE KELLY IN THE MOVIE.
positive;Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellant as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz.<br /><br />The movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny.
positive;"How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from ""India"" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison?"
positive;The continually occurring themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness blasts through the TV with grace and power.
negative;There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to<br /><br />make your toward your TV set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.
positive;They take him in, but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by Porter Hall.<br /><br />This film is mostly to be seen today because it's a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha Heifetz who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody's problems.
positive;The story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick, although the settings helped some.
negative;Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted.
positive;Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerov√°), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Lukn√°r) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise.
negative;In the course of the movie, he devours a bug, a lizard, a toad (I had to leave the room after this), and a whole mouse (I stopped watching at this point, and lost my appetite for days).
negative;I know the decision was made to rate have this be a PG film to get a bigger crowd reaction but I don't think I'm in the minority when I think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals crapping.
negative;I loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and I had forgotten this film existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station.
negative;"This film was apparently made to cash in on the Conan craze, but it fails miserably on all counts.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for the scenes where Ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang-glider during a cutaway.<br /><br />""Thong, fish is ready!"
positive;Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film.
negative;I'm a historian.
positive;Douglas and company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the nocturnal hours.
negative;- Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
positive;Well, this is NO MORE TRUE.
positive;I think they went a little overboard on his character, but that's better than the reverse: showing him worse than what he was in real life.
negative;Not original and not all that entertaining.
negative;The shots are bland, dialog and action both fail to flow.
negative;"<br /><br />The script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered."
negative;"To be honest, objectionable though the underlying message ""Vigilante justice is good"" might be, everything about the movie stinks: the characterizations are pitiful, the acting leaden, the direction plodding, the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody."
positive;"""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."""
negative;It's obvious that Japan can (and does)produce just as much crap as other countries.
positive;I, for one, wouldn't mind living his life at all.
positive;"With Reynolds as auteur it works.<br /><br />Reynolds, the actor/auteur always seems to be smirking at himself and the viewer as if to say it's all fake, but good fun.<br /><br />Great line: In the scene with Victor when Sharky throws down the gauntlet ""You're walkin' all over people like you own 'em ,and you wanna know the worst part?"
positive;A good outing for all.
positive;Once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of World War II and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!!
positive;With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie.
negative;"""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" is utterly boring and while Jon Knautz obviously does have the talent to create a good film (once again, the last fifteen minutes are killer and ""Still Life"" was amazing ¬ñ check it out), ""Jack Brooks"" completely misses the mark."
positive;The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival, and I'm is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix.
positive;Everything from the west will seem shallow, contrived, ridiculous, in comparison with the Russian movies.
negative;Also, I like that in the year 3000 they still have headsets with wires that go to their mouth.
negative;"<br /><br />Larry Parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of ""Sorceress"" and ended up being in the cast playing his part as Stan."
positive;I recommend it.
positive;A true classic, and if you ever manage to get it on video, you won't regret it.
negative;The movie is a horrible ripoff of the THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series, and apparently has little to do with its source material.
negative;Otherwise, look for better films.
positive;What Peralta has done, however, is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys.
negative;If anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick.
positive;I was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending.<br /><br />Second, the casting.
negative;His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.
negative;"The director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer's needs: he shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, he admits, was rushed, but ""satisfactory""; he thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting."
negative;Silly and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer.
positive;Seen it?
positive;Like the kids here, we were considered the best of the best.
negative;<br /><br />Tedious and un-inspired, the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot, but all it does is showcase it.
negative;The first time was when they cut from Michael with short hair, you know the Thriller era, to Michael with long flowing hair from the Dangerous era AND HE WAS STILL BLACK!
positive;It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting he seems, almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing.
positive;In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video.
positive;It is not.
positive;If he wouldn't have come at the end..then I would have been mad.
negative;It was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie.
positive;After all, she is a television personality.
positive;"It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame."
negative;There's also the usual tacked-on love-interest and predictable ending.<br /><br />This movie was also the first time I'd seen Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick.
negative;Mouse............but I guess it paints a pretty picture and makes a cute cartoon.......but it wasn't the reality then and it ain't reality now.
positive;The female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie!
negative;(Actually, I think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution.
negative;Quaid and the rest of the returning Vacation vets (including the orginal Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here.
negative;Too slow in the beginning, too nonsensical in the middle, and too slow to end.
negative;Whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness, or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach, or the effect of money on professional sports.
negative;Is this better than any decent zombie movie?
negative;The first 1 hour was OK, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside US.
negative;Plus it treats men more respectfully and it's actually entertaining!
negative;Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story.
positive;Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody?
negative;But to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character, in turn taking away the terror of the movie.<br /><br />Overall this is a poorly done movie.
positive;He made that movie better for me.
negative;"The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of ""teenage"" actors.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?"
positive;"He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority, struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff, stolid exterior.<br /><br />Soon Carmen enters (""Loved by all men under the age of 96¬Ö""), and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie."
positive;"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays."
positive;As everyone knows by now, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister.<br /><br />The manifestation of Schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored.
positive;"Especially when Hope Lange (who's a cross between Grace Kelly & Dolores Hart) gets bombed in handsome Stephen Boyd's apartment, he tucks her in & just watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if ""anything"" happened between them the following day)."
positive;To the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that is was the ATF, the FBI, and the higher levels of the United States government who were the ones who were unjust, cruel, and deceptive, and not David Koresh and his followers.
negative;Nick and Michael are WAY better actors than this.
positive;We travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple,loving, honest philosophy in tow.
negative;Only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers.
negative;Evidence of bad writing: Evan determines that God is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan hold up a sign saying Genesis 6:14 when he's walking past his son whose watching a televised baseball game.<br /><br />That's basically the plot of Evan Almighty.
positive;It's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times, it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film.
negative;"And then I thought ""Wow-- somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than ""Magnolia"".<br /><br />I know nothing about the Polish brothers, but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling."
negative;"But all in all, mainly s**t<br /><br />Indiana Jones 4 however is much better, Type ""Jeeharv"" into you-tube as well, the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes, mostly gay ones."
negative;Give it a 3.
positive;"However, in this particular film, Watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts.<br /><br />I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbone's recitation from Richard II - ""...this blessed plot, this earth, this England"" - I can't imagine how much it meant to the Brits watching the film in 1942."
negative;Even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage!
positive;"But ""Tommy Boy"" does not fall in the category of ""Coneheads"" which could have been a little funnier and ""Black Sheep"" which is a piece of tripe."
positive;"One of the results is ""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon,"" starring a top Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne."
negative;The old man mouse in this cartoon would have you believe that all men are created equally EVIL............so if we have to kill men in order to stop Hitler..........we are just as bad as Hitler was killing the Jews........
positive;As the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage.
negative;"The fifth one had to be Katie, she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her ""boyfriend"" Franklin like the pushover he was."
positive;I think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only, then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we, the audience, thinks is an actual occurrence with the parents and son, is in fact all a dream, and from the daughter's POV.
positive;<br /><br />This documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred.
negative;"First off, the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this film last night was ""Why the title of 8MM 2?"
positive;Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms.
positive;The society it portrays is Sweden, its artistic language and the people displayed are generally unmistakably Nordic.
positive;The 1990s was a great decade for British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY arriving onto TV screens for the first time.<br /><br />However, MR. BEAN is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s.<br /><br />MR.
negative;Although I've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable.
positive;Never seen it?
positive;I've been intending to write a review of this film for some time, but only now have I actually managed to get my thoughts down for the perusal of others.<br /><br />I never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the `big screen' which is a shame, as it is often visually stunning, but I have revisited it on video numerous times over the years, enjoying it immensely every time.
negative;6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Student bashing, couple of my mates ended up in hospital 9) The discarded joint that started a fire.
positive;Inside the house, Wood and Homer witnesses the strange relationship between Ames and the house owners, however, this is all a plan conceived to impress Wood: everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery.
negative;Anyway, occasionally Chinese men would wander into the village, take a fancy to the local girls, seduce them and then abandon them.
positive;"Oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, ""Kiss Me."""
negative;Joke was, the theater was showing another Mi Mi Lay(A great name at least!)
positive;Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating!
positive;For the most part, it succeeded.
negative;I heard good things about its beauty, and how touching it was and decided why not?
positive;Jed, who has been raised by Gus, both inspires and looks up to the `older' Gus and Mungo, and has an especially difficult time dealing with `civilization.'
positive;I still love the makeup scene.
positive;I don't want to spoil it.
negative;The book really wasn't hard to follow.
positive;I watched this movie on LOGO television today.
positive;Also again I just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic.
negative;He blew up the stash of money and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and no one saw him.
positive;It is for this reason why the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world.
positive;The story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, washing ashore a tropical island.
positive;But no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring.<br /><br />Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, inoffensive, harmless U-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy.
positive;I hate films about sports.
positive;The one who really animates Max's life in fact is her best friend.
positive;The fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well done.You don't even see it coming.
positive;This one is obviously low-budget, but it is certainly well done.
positive;"The option of ""The Curse of Monkey Island"" or ""The Curse of Monkey Island: Mega-Monkey"" (which involves trickier and more abundant puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice."
positive;i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film.
negative;There's the city-folk from New York stuck in a remote backwoods town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman).
negative;Of course, I would write a 15 page essay one why I like the Shichinintai so much but that would be boring for some of you.
negative;The visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above, since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen, and even when they are, the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture.
negative;"Paha maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a Finnish ""European film"" for big audiences."
negative;[The actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling.
positive;From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and so many others¬Ö.
positive;Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to.
negative;"Many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the Universal films on ""Horror Incorporated"" and ""Creature Feature Night""."
negative;"Huge, waddling, grimacing tree trunk menaces fake ""natives"" on a ""Pacific Atoll"" (looking suspiciously like Southern CA...), reaking havok and revenge."
positive;The plans the Coyote comes up with are very funny.
positive;The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.<br /><br />The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age.
positive;This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid.
negative;"The characters are obnoxious stereotypes (black Chris Tucker type, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite Old Couple, Asian Tour Guide) whose interactions are marred by painful, trying-to-be-hip dialogues and mostly obvious stabs at humor (not quite as bad as ""Cabin Fever,"" but still); the script has too much padding (the ""rustling bush"" scene, for example), and ""Hatchet"" winds up as typical as any postmodern slasher of the last decade, with its only distinguishing trait an expertly-calculated hype machine."
positive;His story continues in the excellent film Seul Contre Tous
positive;Will it ever be released as a home movie?
positive;www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
negative;"The only good part of the whole thing was ""the roach scene"" and, by the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the roach!"
positive;Think about it-how many women reject men with hearts of gold(like Gary) for jerks?
positive;Some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was I think H.O.T.S.
negative;I usually like hongkong - martial arts - fantasy movies but I hated this one.
negative;In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, go watch it if there's nothing else.
positive;I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and crew have developed over the years.
negative;"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer."
positive;Wallowing in guilt he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done.
negative;Just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own, some pesky humans start attacking you!!
negative;*spoilers end* Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa.
negative;After viewing this I feel empty inside.
negative;Perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid.
negative;This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.<br /><br />You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back.
negative;At first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission.
negative;And when I found out it was Flex, I just started to feel so bad.
positive;"Less often noticed, although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when Stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and Day belts out ""Que Sera, Sera"" (written for this film) in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party.<br /><br />Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greater work, it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole."
negative;The story involves an Italian Australian(?)
positive;), and constant lack of information.
positive;It's an emotional roller-coaster.
negative;The audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing Dead People.
positive;Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali, it was hard to choose who is cuter, and add in Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names, and you get a blockbuster.
positive;I don't get it!
positive;This splicing of THE SEARCHERS is one of the weirdest films I've ever seen, filmed by a Briton in a strange, unfamiliar Mexico.
positive;Well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were I feel they didn't show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel just so scripted.
positive;It's low-brow and heavy-hitting.
positive;It's all I can say.
positive;Finally, it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
positive;Anybody know if it is on DVD yet??
negative;I truly despair for womankind when they discuss this joke of a programme as if it's intellectually engaging and promotes female liberation and independence.
positive;It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes!
negative;Thirdly, it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission.
positive;It should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence, with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain.
positive;Lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choosing to man Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsos from assembling a war party.
negative;The sheriff investigating the death discovers the startling identity of the killer responsible for the murders.
positive;You get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film.
positive;Since my first viewing of USA it had grown on me like a custom fit dream where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience.
negative;Pathetic.<br /><br />If it was bad all the way through, it would have been far easier to swallow.
negative;Overall, this series was a disappointment, and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series.
negative;You have ruined my life.
negative;You give that great movie a bad name.
negative;and by the way... Have fun watching it !
positive;His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife, Corrina.
negative;Nevertheless, Michalkovs unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there.
negative;and I am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far I would appreciate the feed back, I collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks.
positive;This film was the beginning, that film the end, of a terrific run for a dancing genius.
negative;Cold indeed!!
negative;Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - e.g.
positive;Mr. Bell is already a great director at 31-years old.
positive;They're not the true Ghoulies since they look like guys in a Troll costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts.<br /><br />Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find Johnathan.
negative;But beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story.
negative;All within the span of about fifteen minutes.
negative;However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it.<br /><br />Second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore.
positive;"Jeanne has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either.<br /><br />Movie making, Ms. Breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art."
negative;As I said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential.
positive;But, as cartoons starring Tweety go, this one is quite good, but it's ALL thanks to that brilliant cat.
negative;I love B-Movies as well.
positive;Ava Gardner as wonderful as always, with such a delightful character that is absolutely iresistable.
negative;Seriously, I couldn't even stay awake the first time I tried to watch it.
positive;"As nuclear power prepares to make a comeback in these days of $3 gas, ""The China Syndrome"" is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago."
negative;And that, to me, is the most disturbing part of the film.
positive;The last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end.
positive;In it, Slaughter takes on the Mafia and kicks lots of butt down in Mexico.
positive;Rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it, as weather, land, ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard.
negative;Not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Joseph's character.
positive;Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY.
positive;Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well.
positive;I'm a 55-year-old fairly jaded gay white man.
positive;"<br /><br />Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (""A band who put the GYP in gypsy."
positive;How this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me.
negative;In fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.<br /><br />Also, why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models?
negative;seeing such movies as Devdas in the same line as this movie does a grave injustice to a decent movie.
negative;Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...
negative;It just didn't work for me.
negative;Well, if you've never seen anything to do with Venezuela, there's a lot of travelogue footage of both Caracas and the countryside (and jungle-side), and of the various native peoples at work and play, as well as plenty of indigenous wildlife.
negative;So...watch if you want.
positive;this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal.
positive;Most of this is due to the always genial acting of Ronald Colman.
negative;"I loved so much last Bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece ""L'Ora di Religione""."
negative;Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect.
negative;In the original, Smart would insult a big foe, attack him with no success, and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized.
negative;I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised at how completely WRONG this movie was.
negative;Of course the Minister, the Army and the entire entourage accept her prioritization without question.
negative;One can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle, reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of MacMurray's ineptness.
negative;Return to Sender, a.k.a.
positive;Ethnicity is our heritage in the U.S., and we should embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity.
positive;And the overall performance is outstanding.
negative;It's not comedy, it's not funny.
positive;It isn't afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes.
positive;"The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well."
positive;This one reeler produced by MGM in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin.
positive;Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.'
negative;"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister.<br /><br />Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's ""Guyana - Crime of the Century""."
positive;Drum gives him permission and Lance picks the worst men.
negative;We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that.<br /><br />This movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn.
negative;Far away.
positive;Christopher Eccelston brought a side of the Doctor that we never get to see, a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time.<br /><br />A MUST SEE!
positive;He talks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge.
positive;As I watched this film I could only think about how I hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily.
negative;The fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the 'star' doesn't have much charisma.
negative;I could ramble on about the acting which is fairly well done (especially horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how the creature prosthetics are a nice throwback to the days when films didn't use CGI, but it really doesn't matter.
positive;Return to L.D.
negative;The other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife.
negative;The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot, because after you see the ending that I will not spoil, it just didn't make any sense.<br /><br />A diplomat and his fianc√©e are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area, she's very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome.
positive;The country and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumnal weather adds to the melancholy background superbly.
positive;But the movie did its job and did it very well, presenting a great depiction of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit.
negative;I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great Fox films.
negative;I guess I'll never learn.
positive;All they do is entertain!<br /><br />I give this DVD a 100 out of 100.
negative;And to make matters worse, EVER heard of stereo?
negative;"The track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... All of these characters are prime candidates for ""Serial Slasher of the Year"" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it."
positive;I would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness....but spite of that slight flaw, it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it.
positive;"Featuring songs by Donovan (one of which - ""Colors"" - appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: ""The Limey"" (which, incidentally, came out in 1999, when I was as old as my parents were when ""Poor Cow"" came out))."
positive;It's an homage to all the stars of the great TV western classics, and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie.
negative;There are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers.
positive;As Rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, yet I found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie.
negative;this 2.5 hour diluted snore-fest appears to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation, ever.
positive;The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such.
positive;Not great but far better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger calls, and perhaps better than some of the other crap that I wouldn't bother to see.
negative;The pictures sort of look like album covers.
positive;It will make you really angry.
positive;It's Sellers at his sleaziest, slimiest best as a crooked hospital administrator.
negative;That's okay.
negative;This is an unforgivable liberty with the novel.
positive;A similar problem occurs with Anwar's distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface.
negative;Something must cause it, obviously, the only thing I can say is that I am quite sure what doesn't cause it: the movie itself.<br /><br />There are no jokes in it.
negative;The actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present.
negative;that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably IS creepy.
negative;Not worth your time.
negative;I fail to see how anyone who has actually read the M. Didius Falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them.
negative;Too bad.
positive;He is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives.
positive;But Ridley is into more superficiality, and when he sees Helen at a dinner party, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club.
negative;Another gray, horrible bit of schlockiness from the family Corman.
positive;Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all.
positive;"Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: ""Secret Service this, Secret Service that!"
negative;It confirmed my doubts about sequels.
positive;He plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is no one special me.
positive;This film will not change the world.
positive;10 out of 10.
negative;Folks who haven't seen Surveillance... stick to something with a little more intelligence.
positive;I am hoping that Warner Brothers releases this title on DVD very soon.
positive;It really is a work of art and I'm sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as I do.
positive;We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.<br /><br />My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff.
negative;Great ¬ñ you've just imagined the entirety of the film `India Song.
positive;I needed something to keep me from going insane with tension, anxiety (what if it isn't as good?!
negative;Chabrol - but this was a glossy shambolic mess.
positive;"This is another of John Travolta's ""come back"" movies, and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one, his come back will take hold.<br /><br />This is so sweet...sickeningly so if you're not into the romance comedy scene."
negative;There's a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards.<br /><br />The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Augustus is reliving.
negative;<br /><br />I admit the film was interesting until the point the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the President.
negative;Which is definitely not the case.
negative;There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through.
positive;It is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film.
positive;Deneuve is very, very beautiful.
positive;"Later Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that Ansel was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash, ransom, in it.<br /><br />Fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of New York City that was so effective in the movie ""The French Connection"" which also stars both Roy Scheider & Tony Lo Bianco who are in this movie too."
positive;I could see myself in this same predicament - passively allowing things to happen around me, not standing up for the right and decent thing, just trying to avoid trouble.
positive;One night Billy gets locked in the movie studio.
negative;First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away.
positive;Somehow, the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a very unique way.
negative;He hides out in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras.
negative;I wasn't the least bit interested.
positive;Although this is far from his best.
negative;The bug reaches a tunnel in New York where the soldiers eventually destroy it.
positive;There's tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of).
negative;Other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film.
negative;<br /><br />- Terrible explanation of the numbers.
negative;In ignoring them (e.g.
negative;He shouldn't be.
negative;It is very very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming totem poll, the move is so low budget.
positive;Once again the BBC has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie.
negative;The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman.
positive;When the wife disappears, her sister begins a vigorous search involving the local police, state government, and a television crime show.
positive;Grace is one of Kathy Bates' best roles.
negative;As a bonus, we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie.<br /><br />There's really not much to say about this film.
positive;Honestly I'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view.
negative;"It is a sort of Scooby Doo like approach that makes ""Ghost Hunters"" ... almost believable.<br /><br />Whereas ""Paranormal State"" claims to have EVPs but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in Garage Band with no audio."
positive;!<br /><br />However, I wonder how they will manage to translate all the French names in English or German, because it is certainly funny in French but how will it be in another language ??
positive;But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back, which leads to a cruel custody trial.<br /><br />Kramer vs. Kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold-hearted a viewer untouched.
positive;In the London area, it was put out on Sundays at 7.25 P.M. where it was trounced in the ratings by the B.B.C.
negative;By the end I was laughing hysterically at the unevenness of the film's tone (the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two streetwise shady characters are unintentionally hilarious), the utterly baffling plot, the absurd coincidences and strokes of good fortune (e.g.
positive;Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence.
positive;Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of Des Moines, Iowa in which the rockers wear their own distinguished mask (I know someone already said this, but I need to fill up space for this review).
positive;Owes an awful lot to Sergei Eisenstein's editing technique, but never as coolly detached or 'scientific' as Eisenstein could frequently get.
positive;it deserved more airplay and recognition.
negative;It is not funny.
positive;Entrapped by power he becomes a monster.
negative;The sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap.
negative;As in she SHOOTS him.
positive;The most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors.
negative;For me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish.
negative;"I actually felt embarrassed for the ""stars"" in this ""film""."
positive;These 2 actors were among the best.<br /><br />I said above the film is flawed, There are a few script deficiencies in few spots, They are minor,The acting is the thing in this movie.
negative;Poorly acted, shot, directed, written, scored, edited.
positive;What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.
negative;If it does, I will be happy.
positive;"The method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I still haven't cracked some of them!<br /><br />The game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this isn't as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the game's sequel ""Perfect Dark"", it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of RC-P90 fire!"
positive;Not many people have seen this film, and it is a shame because it is a work of art.
negative;<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right?
negative;Hmm.
negative;Yes, said title line does actually appear in this movie.
positive;It's been years since I saw Dolemite and I still quote it to this day.
negative;Shame they were killed off.
positive;Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace.
positive;Sharky is captured by some Ninja killers lead by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and is tortured for information to lead to Dominoe, but Sharky overpowers them and arrests the Governor and in a heated chase kills Billy after he has killed Victor.<br /><br />Reynolds wants to exhibit the inner workings of a hardened policemen falling in love, but the police-story plot, flavored with noir element, and Reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships.<br /><br />We come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their pensions in vice, instead of fighting real crime- this element of the film seems sketchy under Reynolds' off-handed direction and performance.<br /><br />There is always uniqueness to a Reynolds film.
positive;If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this film.
negative;"Of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.<br /><br />The dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as ""What do you do for a living?"""
positive;Someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be, and it was reported stolen!
negative;There is some mention of a demon from the sea but that doesn't go anywhere at all.
negative;I found her performance particularly impressive, as the stunning drug addict-turned would-be savior.
negative;Give me something new to think about.<br /><br />On the upside, the writing is pretty good.
positive;Bergman's films are virtuosic in presenting human relationships--that he would bring this to a war film is masterful.
negative;It's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way.
positive;Indeed, in this regard, the low budget quite possibly aids the film's intentions, necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario.
positive;The series worked just fine in the present day.
negative;I am almost tempted to demand my money back from the video store.
negative;<br /><br />Carlos Mencia is no George Lopez.
negative;She takes the doll home.
positive;Until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil.
negative;That brings us to lighting.
positive;I can see some green screen stuff but it doesn't detract too much from the acting.<br /><br />The Bad: 1.
negative;<br /><br />Still, I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: <br /><br />- Horrible second part.
negative;"I was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical American mass movie: ""We are in this for the money..."" If only the producers had had more time to actually MAKE the movie."
negative;Keener doesn't even try to sound like an Alabama native.
positive;Hurt and the dog typically semi-interact with the story, but this time Minghella pushes it up that extra notch in the 'ring' scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow.
negative;Outstanding character acting by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting cast.
positive;Let's hope its brought back from celluloid extinction.
positive;"It innovates the form of documentary while showcasing a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primal similarity found within the traveling music of (historically) traveling peoples.<br /><br />Indeed the film itself is a single ""take"" of sweeping movement that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next.<br /><br />Watching this film, one's breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music, rhythm and dance."
positive;But I managed to catch a later episode, and was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft.<br /><br />As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum', Perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins' holiday camp.
positive;I don't know if I will be strong enough to watch it again.
positive;And from it's opening sepia-tinged shot to the macabre climax I was utterly enthralled.
positive;I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him.
positive;Not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive.
negative;That plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top.
positive;Realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here.
positive;This is one of Peter Sellers' best movies.
positive;Two of the cast have successful T.V.
positive;"Overall, the show really appeals to the younger population, as we like to see the outcome of a ""player's"" performance at the club, as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging panel."
positive;And when you get bored of the story, there are endless mysteries, glitches and easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of.
positive;I had been looking all over for this movie, for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just had to get it.
negative;"Oddly enough, it's Fred MacMurray who plays the more ""screwy"" part in this screwball comedy."
negative;The director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison to the world.
positive;"It was a contrast to a lot of the kid-type of animation I was watching at the time; I was still a minor junkie for Disney and Looney Tunes stuff, and most Saturday morning cartoons were still on the run-off of the peak from the days of Ninja Turtles and Batman."
positive;The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more.
positive;Everyone and everything involved in the movie added to the punkiness of it.
positive;But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity.
positive;You also find out who Satan really is!
negative;The vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining, snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters.
negative;Perhaps I'm being too generous when I give this film two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment.
positive;When Edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to Timbucktu.
positive;This spends a lot of time on the physical training, in preparation for the fighting and such.
negative;To watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark.
negative;I'm not one to nitpick about special effects, but what you've got to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you shouldn't anchor your film around special effects.
negative;Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film.
negative;It also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text.
negative;Unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating (though acrobatic) young boy.
positive;Gregg Henry delivers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon provides some occasional charisma.
positive;This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History.
positive;There are documentaries that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better.
positive;An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration.
negative;I'm really, really disappointed they could have done better stuff, than this piece of junk.
negative;"One of my particular ""favorites"" was when Divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to bust it up, they were butchered and eaten by the guests."
positive;I think there's a deluxe 3-DVD version that contains both cuts of the film - not sure.<br /><br />The versions compliment each other so well that as a pair, I'll watch Daisy more often than I do any of my other favorite Korean movies.
negative;Once the earthlings and the Martians meet and it's established that they have a common language, and that the Martians have a sinister agenda, that's it.
positive;No other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film-making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend.<br /><br />Today I sat down to Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard.
negative;This movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms.
positive;My recommendation - watch and enjoy.
negative;Together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she processes the bodies into her famous London meat pies.
negative;With The Deadly Mantis, we have a giant praying mantis flying around the arctic, scaring eskimos, and being hounded by the armed forces.
negative;This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that.
negative;The result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance.<br /><br />Not to be confused with Serrador's brilliant WHO COULD KILL A CHILD?
negative;The Chinese ones (or whatever those hieroglyphics are) sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the English ones often show up without the Chinese ones.
positive;(It should also be mentioned that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this film, although his pallet remain just as colorful.)
positive;I would highly recommend this series for watching on DVD.
positive;Once again showing a different role in this film, he astounds me with his ability to interchange his characters with the next film.<br /><br />I've watch Malkovich play in Con Air as a menacing insanely smart Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few.
positive;"I'm talking about the *theater*!"""
negative;The plot is almost non-existent.
positive;What's wrong with that?
negative;SPOILERS HERE Then, when our intrepid reporter finally gets fired, she comes back to the building several times, once after hours.
positive;"After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks #10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time."
negative;I will, in all my anal-retentive glory, point out what was missing, what has changed, and all else wrong with the movie.<br /><br />Sit tight and here goes:<br /><br />-Apparently, RAFE is son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently, ULF is no longer ASTRID'S child, like in the book.
positive;She looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease.
positive;The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half.
negative;)<br /><br />Lay it Down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes.
positive;Colonel Marstonis a reckless man, who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent.
negative;Tried to watch with an open mind, but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history, locations, church protocol, et cetera.
negative;junk, forget it, don't waste your time etc etc
positive;He made $700,000 US into one of the top 50 films of all time.
positive;The girl's life is in real danger now, since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be alive¬Ö *** End Spoilers ***.
negative;The result is crap.<br /><br />To make it short: - The story is pretentious, na√Øve and not credible.
positive;"The bottleneck in the mountains keeps the Indians from riding through in strength; instead, they must come through one-at-a-time."
negative;"And don't use ""low budget"" as an excuse...I have seen many GREAT low-budget films....in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget."
positive;Jake Gyllenhaal guested on Conan O'Brien to promote the movie and explained that 'Rendition' was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture.
negative;Neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it's from 'their own people'.
positive;That cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since.
negative;Just plain terrible.
positive;Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even greater.
negative;He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No.
positive;Before the police can build a case with the evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, a coke-snorting gunman (Henry Silva) shoots through the door of Dominoe's apartment seemingly killing the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested.
positive;You really got to know her well through her diary.
negative;Just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.<br /><br />But other than that, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies.
positive;"All of them hate him and would willingly kill him.<br /><br />""Only the Valiant"" exemplifies the new breed of military western after World War II."
positive;"An alternate title considered for the film was ""Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation"", which thankfully was not used, otherwise I am sure raunchy jokes about the fact that it takes place at a girls' school would be difficult to avoid."
positive;Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally gets up the courage to leave him, leaving Ted to care for their five year old son (Justin Henry).
negative;Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing.
positive;Pay more attention (to those of you who don't fanatically adore this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection).
positive;"Harmony points out Tucsos is ""the fella that started this whole business."""
positive;"The dancing starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her ""purple harem"" bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion."
positive;Every time I view it, some other aspect rises to the top, some other viewpoint come into sharp focus.
positive;<br /><br />What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that, in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of `The Last Frontier' are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music)<br /><br />First, the screenplay.
positive;"The songs, including ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"", are lively and upbeat."
positive;We get to know the character, both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life.
negative;the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and did'nt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie.
positive;So many clues and twitches and puzzles.
positive;Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted Horrigan in friendly banter.
positive;Blind to an inevitable apocalypse.
positive;We couldn't escape the titular song on the radio.
positive;Along with some great writing - even when a joke isn't sure-fire, the wit behind it compensates - the animation style, while a far cry from some of the refurbished, computer-enhanced product of today, is inventive and often abstract.
positive;The pair could be anyone.
positive;Well, except for the ending, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Juliet's abusive father, and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children.<br /><br />THIS is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts.
positive;About three fourths of the movies on the IMDb top 250 are without special effects, but almost all of the Top Grossing movies of all time have some special effects.
negative;), who immediately throttles Cotten(who took his royalty check & ran), and wanders around throttling everyone in sight.
positive;There is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.<br /><br />Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted.
negative;Vivian even gets tipsy in the book and trashed her room.<br /><br />-GABRIEL bears a striking resemblance to a Columbian Drug Lord in the movie.
negative;Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler.
positive;True to his legend, Herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned.
negative;In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit.
negative;"One piece of information I picked up was that a sequel was in development and that this time, it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to ""the creation of a hero""."
positive;If only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features.
positive;"Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, ""Yes, dear"", pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm.<br /><br />There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- it's too bad Christopher Olsen read them so woodenly."
negative;Tomorrow I'm going to get my money back.
positive;"The helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for ""doing good""."
positive;The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional.<br /><br />Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than Eastwood's.<br /><br />While this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation.
negative;This movies Strongest point is that it had a Briliant Storyline, and one of the best Western plots ever, and for a while its fun to watch as John Reid is nursed back to health,after he and his fellow Rangers are ambushed.Its fun to see him grow into his new life and Identity as the Lone Ranger,as he concels his identity, and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with.
negative;Also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy, compared with the likes of 1995's P&P, for example.<br /><br />The script is, if anything too faithful to the book, and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut.<br /><br />In every way this is far inferior to the recent film version, which though it took huge liberties with the book, seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable.
negative;Luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely.
positive;When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist, he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers, only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park.
positive;I am checking with my local library for it, titled 'Mrs Maitlands Affair, by Margarett Lynn.
negative;I'm not kidding.
positive;Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'.
positive;Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be Oscar nominated.
negative;Fourthly, a friend recommended it to me.
negative;"But this movie does have a flashback; and here's the kicker: it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie!<br /><br />The characters were stereotypical, unsympathetic, and wholly ridiculous."
positive;You won't find any truly shocking disclosures here, aside from infidelity on both sides, which in good part is what makes this such a gem.
negative;ENJOY!!
positive;It describes reality.
negative;Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat?
positive;Obviously Hitler patterned his appearance after Charlie's from this film.
negative;This government funded film is just another failure by Australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids.<br /><br />I am giving it zero stars because its an insult to the descendants of these truly great Australians and their enormous sacrifice.
positive;I was a little afraid when I went to the cinema to see this movie.
negative;"I kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened - yes, it does happen more than once if you can believe it.<br /><br />I notice other mentioned ""Blair Witch: and it did remind me of that in the way the camera was bouncy."
negative;I only recently began reviewing films for the IMDB, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which I believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre.
positive;So..what if it did happen?
negative;Wanda Sykes isn't wasted, she's just a waste in anything she does, and her horrible one-liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.<br /><br />The story itself is just predictable and lazy.
positive;The director's cut, I'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, as I find the pacing dull.
positive;This certainly is one of the best western movies produced in the new Millennium.
positive;Really good in fact.
negative;And he sort of sounds like one too.
positive;I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind.
positive;The point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness.
positive;I saw it 3 times as I waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive.<br /><br />Then I got the DC and watched it.
positive;"""The Dead"" truly is a work of art."
negative;While away, he accidentally kills an enchanted animal which brings a curse upon him.
negative;"If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too ""different"", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie."
positive;"She won't even flip just one for Greenstreet, saying ""I've never flipped in me life."""
positive;Very real, very raw.
positive;He and Dent are apparently late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to make it up to him: he produces two prostitutes.
negative;I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr@p film.
positive;The great acting by Gere and Lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much.
positive;The armor that James Earl Jones and the Leader of the Teutonic Knights wear are virtually identical.
positive;She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language.
positive;Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time.
negative;"This has a fat 45 year-old with 3 tits and a tail, in a cantina scene cloned directly from ""Star Wars."""
positive;It really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it entertaining to the modern generation.
negative;"I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed ""genius"" by anyone who watches it."
negative;Again, we begin somewhat strong, and end chaotic.
positive;He eventually picks up a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools.
positive;I believe the American people have grown up since this movie was made.
negative;Things just get worse.
positive;It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere.
positive;He starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son.
negative;I spend way to much money on this movie in the theater.
negative;Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed.
positive;Dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humour that one would expect from a British rather than a French movie.
negative;Common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge.
negative;They grab Mom and Dad's video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot.
negative;So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right?
positive;The Closer She Gets... is an artful documentary dealing with the death of a person I actually knew.
negative;Anyway Evan (Steve Carell) has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a congressman.
positive;The teens, all being punk smart-asses, all of course object to having to do any real work, but they're part of some unique co-ed work program, yep, what a great idea that is, of course.
positive;Interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong (don't they all?).
negative;The story was completely unreal.
positive;And if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard, Harrison Ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.<br /><br />For five and a half bucks at Wal-Mart, with full length director commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette, the DVD is well worth owning.
positive;It had some the best talent available and a funny story.
positive;But it was worth it.
negative;It was great material for MST 3K, I have to admit though.
positive;Now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good Asian horrors being made, the likes of Marebito and Shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day.
positive;A fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son.
positive;But the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed!
negative;I can count on one hand the number of films I've walked out on over the years.
positive;Add to this a stupendous story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end.<br /><br />Finally in conclusion, a uniquely special mention must go to the designers of this game.
positive;Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very high-rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web.
positive;I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film.
positive;Then Hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute.
positive;The plot starts out interesting, however, towards the end too many die in too short a time, turning the thriller-mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter.<br /><br />The only true highlights were Adam Beach and J√ºrgen Prochnow, who were once again their excellent selves.
negative;Doh!
positive;When the Bicentennial hit, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team.
positive;Pure evil.
positive;It is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media.
negative;Feel free to send me your suggestions.
negative;"Years ago, a bunch of ""gypsies"" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire."
positive;But it still is one of the best new western productions I've ever seen.
positive;This motion picture is an excellent adaptation of a great opera.
negative;(spoiler alert) the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man.
positive;This is an extraordinarily good film.
negative;Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all.
positive;"Like Margot in ""Fear of Fear"" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like Fox in ""Fox and his friends"" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in ""The Stationsmaster's Wife"" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German ""Wirtschaftswunder""-Society after World War II in R.W."
positive;"While ""Waterfront"" benefited immensely from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently disguised Kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify naming names (as Kazan did eagerly before the House Un-American Activities Committee), ""Edge of the City"" boasts a young John Cassavetes and an upstart Sidney Poitier daring to confront issues that ""Waterfront"" failed to acknowledge, namely, workers' rights and race relations.<br /><br />""Edge of the City"" boldly dives into this (then) unknown territory, and although the quite appealing black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit Hollywood simplistic, the courageous struggle against thinly-veiled bigotry and violence has hardly aged at all."
negative;House Party 4 buried the series, and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline, I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died.
positive;He stumbled off a bus, complaining of fever and a headache, and soon died in a Midtown Hospital, but not before he had infected a dozen passers-by.
negative;More than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how BORING the film is, even with a running time of a mere 80 minutes.
negative;I did not appreciate the Houdini, James Bond, Mission Impossible style escapes that Sir Percy engineered either.
positive;Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin?
negative;Thank you Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination.
positive;He is one intense actor!
negative;"Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn ""Adorable One""; here, he is ""Mr. Shawn"".<br /><br />Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke?"
positive;The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.
positive;If there was a choice for all-time best serial, this (arguably) should be #1.
negative;I remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure .Although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way Chinese people were making films at the time .
positive;He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain.
positive;Give this man $100 million for his next film!
positive;In our opinion this is a 'must have' particularly if you have no 'silents' in your collection.
positive;Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation.
negative;It's brain dead, stupid, nonsensical, unfunny, lame.
negative;Pointless.
negative;This movie was appallingly bad on so many levels I just don't know where to start.
negative;Drugs are bad?
negative;The only way to get enjoyment out of it is to light a match and burn the tape of it, knowing it will never fall into the hands of any sane person again.
positive;The ending you dread stalks the viewer throughout, but is still able to startle when it finally arrives.
negative;If you believe Benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat.
negative;I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged!
negative;Storyline is absolutely THE most ridiculous I've ever come across, and that's saying a lot!
positive;For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly.
negative;I have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake.
positive;Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times.
negative;Boy, did I make a mistake!<br /><br />EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle.
negative;That was nice.
negative;Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I didn't feel that way.. Who cared about the stupid Italian police officer?
positive;The influence of adults is interesting - it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip-its of conversations and interactions-much like a child would remember experiencing.
positive;<br /><br />Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review.
negative;Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the straight man.
negative;Mason has the largest and most central role in this drama, as the scion of the wealthier family.
positive;That's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered, while being filmed.
negative;What could have been a good film is that the firefighter are put way up as heroes because they are firemen and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama.<br /><br />4.9/10
negative;This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 (which is made by me), anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie, I mean come on the actors had a bad performance, the story is just crap.
positive;"It's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films (""Vertigo"", ""Strangers on a Train""), but all the same it is one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces."
positive;"When the girl becomes frightened, they both leave cinema and begin to walk home, at which point Michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song, ""Thriller."""
negative;But boy, was I in for a shock<br /><br />I love horror movies.
negative;This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen.<br /><br />*spoilers* There were just so many fundamental problems with the story.
negative;What a come down from Fox values and standards!
negative;"After the first five minutes of watching this ""film"", I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life."
positive;The ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.
negative;AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive;She and intellectual at heart, he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work.
positive;Nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity.
positive;Although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other.
positive;Sadly enough, there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene.
negative;It's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense, but it's good for those nights alone, because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core.<br /><br />4/10
positive;I love happy endings.
positive;He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken).
negative;When, oh when, will Hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers?
negative;Uhhhhhhh.
positive;The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling.
positive;And every punch and kick so woefully executed.
positive;It had everything action, adventure, thrill, and much more...<br /><br />I can't imagine how hard it was for Ruby-Spears company to make this great cartoon, there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it, for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because I wouldn't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent!<br /><br />The cartoons will never be the same as they were before, that is why I hope that they all will be released on DVD specially The Centurions as it's my favorite.
positive;I'm really glad I ran across this movie.
positive;Nevertheless, Mature is very endearing, playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid.
negative;The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical.
negative;I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after awhile.
positive;It is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life.
negative;This was after I slowly backed away from the TV with remote in hand, jaw dropping lower and lower.
negative;Very well, I must say, even though I don't speak Chezck.
positive;McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin(you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for manners headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that was the Civil War - particularly in the South.
positive;But the movie itself captured the whole punk genre.
positive;From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea ¬ñ it's almost as if Nana can do no wrong.
positive;There is infrared footage that clearly shows the FBI was shooting with machine guns at the men, women, and children in the burning compound.
negative;So we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so shockable nor so dumb.<br /><br />The problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse.
negative;AVOID AT ALL COSTS!<br /><br />Comment to the director: I hate you.
positive;But Vijay Raaz...I find myself constantly coming back to him- because he is what MAKES this movie.
negative;Caine narrates the proceedings with considerable sly wit and low-keyed sarcasm, but his actual performance is bereft of energy (Caine's shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere, and he connects with nobody on the screen).
negative;"An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the ""eternal flame"" of Augustus."
positive;"Fragment storytelling really hasn't worked this well since ""Pulp Fiction""."
positive;Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience!
positive;"It isn't just the exterior that's more attractive; we come to know much more about the kind of person Jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody)."
positive;"""Until Death"" lacked the over-the-top action of most Van Damme films but was dark and gritty and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film."
negative;They ask the sergeant to divulge information on another German unit.
positive;Eventually, she decides to stop the pesky Coburn from phoning incessantly (he ALWAYS complains that his paper won't survive without his son) by pretending to be Knox--writing wonderful editorials that everyone just assumes were written by him.<br /><br />While there is nothing earth-shaking in this film, it's a very interesting slice of life move.
positive;(Hey, I'm a dork too.)
negative;Outside of that, it might have been an interesting movie about middle class fetish, but I was too annoyed to care.<br /><br />Perhaps if Arbus name had been left off, this might have been less annoying, but had it not had her name in the title there would have been nothing to make me interested in seeing in this in the first place.
positive;I never got that far.
positive;Ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him?
positive;I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal.
positive;I've never seen anything like it!
negative;), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters.
positive;This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA).
positive;In the groovy mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young Venice, California adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the Z-Boys turned the previously staid world of professional skateboarding on its ear with their fierce punk attitude, radical unconventional riding style, and unbridled spirit of pure in-your-face aggression, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake.
positive;Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.<br /><br />I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.
negative;"Tania(Bay) decides to switch the brain of her lover(who is old and wrinkly) with the brain of a younger man (who is ""beautiful"", but stooopid), in order to make ANOTHER monster to throttle the first monster Cotten made, who is wandering around throttling people."
negative;is the message here.
negative;Some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes.
positive;I honestly don't know why this is rated so low, but for kids, especially your Barbie lovin' 8 year old will love this.
positive;It's a sad state in corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one.
negative;<br /><br />Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly Hannibal Lecter.
positive;For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation.
positive;This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule.
negative;How would we feel if Native Americans somehow made a hit film in which they reek bloody vengeance on the American settlers?
negative;There's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment.
positive;James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car.
positive;Filmed in the 1970s, this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies.
negative;As well, Joanne Whalley is very uneven.
positive;When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry.
negative;Lame.
positive;She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai.
negative;It is a scary time when a whole group of people can be unceremoniously trounced with no defense and no real facts presented.
negative;I can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor.
positive;Governments are elected for three year terms, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing Labor to the Polls until they were defeated.
negative;"The participants seem very experienced, as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life; and I'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards... though I resent having the act thrust in my face as ""entertainment"".<br /><br />What I WISH I could overlook (or HAD overlooked) are the numerous, totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man, who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals."
positive;This film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic.
positive;I can't recall any, except in a Carol Burnett skit, where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get (a kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also reassurance that their not married to a namby-pamby type).
positive;Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on D.V.D.
negative;The NYC tourist board must hate the way this garbage is showing up their otherwise fine city!
positive;It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.<br /><br />Watch out for this young director...he's going places.
negative;<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems that the general population doesn't think anymore, they just want blood.
positive;The film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack,lol.
negative;"It looks like one of the countless, cheap and simple animation-series like ""DragonballZ"", ""Beyblade"" etc."
negative;Mike and his posse head for the beach to gulp booze, play volleyball & bicker until the scarecrow arrives to end their little soir√©e.
positive;She had a nice soprano even as a child.<br /><br />But it's Heifetz you see the show for.
positive;Once the man reaches England, however, his troubles are just beginning.
positive;This film will touch you.
positive;A very bizarre bringing to the screen of William Shakespeare's tragic love story.<br /><br />The Que family and the Capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence.
positive;Have a reunion show!!
positive;EIGHTEEN as written and directed by Richard Bell may have a few too many stories to tell simultaneously for a 102 minute movie to completely succeed, but there is such a fine sense of commitment on the part of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends up wanting the movie to work - and so it does.
negative;Scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical.
negative;Again I will watch the 1999 version and hope it is a better and does Jane Austen some justice to her writing.
positive;This is such an exciting documentary, it was by far one of the most fun films I've ever seen.
negative;The other was for Dracula 3000.
positive;Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, lovely, young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin(Amy)have emotional/sexual ties to Eastwood - each having their own needs and secrets and problems.
negative;Donald Sutherland is miscast.
negative;In one scene, he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it.
positive;<br /><br />I just discovered the show and I became addicted to it right away and I was really surprised that it hasn't gotten the recognition it truly deserves.
positive;But the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of the proof that the Holocaust did happen.<br /><br />It also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust closer to home, to lose someone that we could put a familiar face and personality to, at such a young age...literally having had her young life ripped away from her and from the other occupants who were murdered in the Holocaust.
positive;Villain or Victim?
positive;His friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character(sorry I forgot his name), was really funny.
negative;I lost my job, my dignity, and above all my pride.
negative;He's quite accustomed to stomping people.
positive;Definitely a lot of surprises.<br /><br />SPOILERS:DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.<br /><br />Great, knee slappping humor.
negative;<br /><br />Awful, Awful, Awful show.
positive;As i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the US of A regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem.
negative;Here's a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy.
positive;Watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the U.S. government.
positive;Geena Davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia.
negative;"I think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us after so much time of boredom with a so called ""twist""."
positive;great.
positive;This game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters.
positive;What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people.
positive;It may be a remake of the 1937 film by Capra, but it is wrong to consider it only in that way!
positive;When I saw that this film was being aired on late night TV I initially decided to give it a miss.
positive;"(I won't even go into ""42nd Street""'s central line, ""Oh, Guy, it was GRAND of you to COME!"")"
negative;I give it 4 out of 10.
positive;High school.
negative;And as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds, that just beggars belief.
positive;He tries everything he can think of in the short time available to him with predictable results.
negative;Let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serial-killer father behind bars?
negative;So the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet).
negative;The rest of the cast doesn't fare too well either, in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary.
positive;His take on the Prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression he brings to the story.
negative;The movie is bad.
positive;The storyline revolves around two people.
positive;Now that I have seen it, it was NOT what I was expecting, at least not until the very END.
negative;If this was the final product of my hard directorial work, I would be to embarrassed to release it to the public, so I don't even feel sorry for the director if he reads this -- what the hell were you thinking guy?
positive;<br /><br />I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show.
positive;Most people feel the cult was brainwashed by Koresh and followed along with everything that he said.
negative;7 Action scenes are fake, like A) hee-haw!
negative;What a shameful waste and disrespect and I know this review will provoke more negativity from the Movie Show crew and most reviewers but I have a right to my opinion and that's what Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM and that includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion.
negative;Earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and CEMENT.
positive;We are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love.
negative;Is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no ending?
positive;The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team.
positive;Well, that is one of Film's great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom's most poignant and unforgettable.
positive;I would like my son, who is a doctor,to see it.
negative;I didn't believe his acting, it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn't provide.
negative;Much more detail is also put into the novel.
negative;The whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the GOOD side is saddled with Surak--a Vulcan who makes Gandhi seem like Rambo!!
positive;Romantic comedies like this suit her and I believe that she's done her best so far.
positive;It soon becomes clear to Joy that she's going to have to make a serious decision about where she's going in her life.<br /><br />One thing that I determined - I don't know whether or not this is accurate - was a use of irony in the movie.
negative;"Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal and I really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but, from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with cliches from ""Silence"" which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen.<br /><br />Now, I heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out... he did it... but, only in 2 sequences?"
negative;The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it.
positive;That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset.
negative;Which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch Rosemary's Baby before making this?<br /><br />If your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one.
negative;My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane.
negative;"Depends on your level.<br /><br />Thinking about how much money this movie will bring in... there will probably be another ""Hannibal"" made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall."
negative;Richard Harris once again over-indulges in his passion for excessive makeup, toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he's at least 25 years too old for the role, but at least he (perhaps inappropriately) reduces his larger-than-life tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering.
positive;Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary.
positive;If the right actors would remake this film and give it the Patience it needs, to be the Right acting, It could be a block buster.A Love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see.
negative;There you have it folks.
positive;Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage, Homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him (i.e.
negative;The story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst.
negative;I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects¬Ö or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.
positive;wanted to showcase its latest American import - the T.V.
negative;The team itself looks like something from America's Funniest Home Videos, the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other.
positive;Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis.
negative;And the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships.
positive;Both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the story.<br /><br />Unlike Cervantes's tale, in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character.
positive;The story is one which can make you laugh, but also cry as it addresses issues we all must face.
negative;"The cover said ""Their prime cuts were curiously erotic...but thoroughly brutal!"""
positive;Just don't expect Shakespeare!
negative;If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror.
negative;I just don't know why people who write Jane Austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves.
positive;It's overall pretty good, if not a little over-the-top.
positive;The plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you intrigued with it.
negative;"""The Racketeer"" was made in 1929, a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces ¬ó Vidor's ""Hallelujah!,"" Mamoulian's ""Applause,"" Wyler's ""Hell's Heroes,"" Capra's ""Ladies of Leisure"" ¬ó all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically."
positive;A climactic death scene featuring Sterling Holloway is haunting indeed - the most memorable scene in this film, I thought.
positive;There are no human characters to speak of.
positive;I made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement.
negative;They can't act at all, I don't understand why they couldn't at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent!
negative;The head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween.
positive;Nice try with an inappropriate last third, though a good ending.
negative;In fact, they avoid it all together.
negative;I understand that everyone need to start somewhere, but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public.
positive;"(The movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism).<br /><br />Thus, to reject ""Rendition"" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good."
positive;"Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think of it, but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to wear in ""Double Indemnity"" the year before."
negative;I have seen this bands music being sold in Germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album.
positive;A.Einstein
negative;The strong man (Kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash.
positive;despite David spade playing his usual snobby character he made this role into an unusual performance which i don't think he had ever exceeded until he hit the screen with Joe dirt.
negative;Put two and two together and you realise Quentin is doing a favour for his old bud, despite the bud being rather talentless.
positive;I must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately.
negative;It's quite amazing that Working Title would pour ¬£3m into this rubbish.
positive;I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out.
negative;In any case this film was chosen to lead the way .
positive;Nice work!
positive;<br /><br />And Isabelle, who is she really ??
positive;You'll see what I mean.
positive;The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates of most of the shootings, and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles.
negative;"Never mind about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she was supposed to control; as long as her own kids were safe everything was alright."
negative;Other than the funny moments, though, this movie has little to offer.<br /><br />John Ritter annoys the crap out of me, because it sounds like he's reading out of a book.
positive;This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his jowly, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever!<br /><br />This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball, without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot.
positive;We have in this several longer vignettes interspliced with some shorter segues.
negative;I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story.
negative;The plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped.
negative;Our hoodlum gang ambushes a German unit and kills/scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far).
positive;"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli¬¥s Mandolin"", just escapes me!"
negative;Cotten makes an ugly, big-headed monster (cud it really be that much effort to make a nice one??
positive;the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods (man trouble)but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face.
negative;Her reward is getting bounced off the hump in her back into a pit by the Frankenstein Monster at the end of the film...and no one even tries to rescue her!
negative;The cranky drawing style ?
positive;Let me start by saying overall I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight.
positive;This is a film that truly honors America's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling.
positive;But the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about 10~15 years... and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade.
positive;The Rising Damp episodes, however, were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax.
negative;Unfortunately the fairly capable actors I have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is Kerrigan and Saira Todd, both of whom seem to have been in Casualty for too long, and haven't yet learned to act.
negative;I was truly sickened.
positive;The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook.
negative;Not only was Andie McDowell's vioce over pathetic(most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked) the chemistry scale between Tarzan and Jane was a whopping 0.
negative;So what happens?
positive;Your immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well-established `stereotype': The female ice queen, the slightly neurotic 'physician', the playboy and the socially conscious `nice guy' etc.
negative;There are some brief homages to Noir, as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind, but there's really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are awful, Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine.
positive;I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film, while entwining bits of both written tales (e.g.
negative;Anthony Andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable, calm fop.
negative;The performances are just adequate at best.
negative;That fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together, though.
positive;However, IF you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything cut and dried, with a water-tight solution to each issue that comes up ... this film is clearly not meant for you!
negative;Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish.
positive;May we never forget Promised Land!
positive;"If you show his face, then that character becomes a person and not just this ""monster"" who is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children."
positive;The costumes look like the Renaissance appearance one might envision to be.<br /><br />The film portrays a very anti-Semitic vibe.
positive;The people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged, unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert.
negative;This is a show about fearing the unknown like a good Catholic Boy and by god they give you stuff to fear.
positive;The DVD is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up!
negative;There was suppose to be something scary in it but I didn't see anything scary at all.
negative;<br /><br />Overall, this movie was cheap trash.
positive;The male juvenile is a middle-aged twit with lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide.
negative;Lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison.
negative;Unbelievable.
negative;This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order.
negative;I just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine.
negative;PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
positive;It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day.
positive;Highly recommended.
negative;"An attempt to say ""Look at how deep and thought-provoking we can be by using montage!"""
positive;With an introduction like that the mood is set for the surviving 18-year old Pip son (Paul Anthony - looking far too old for credibility as a teenager) to desert his family and live on the streets.
positive;"No longer children, not yet adults, irresistible forces buffet us, pushing and pulling us in every direction.<br /><br />""Fame"" did its best to capture this turbulent, chaotic period for its cast of young characters."
negative;However, B.F.(before frank) this show was funny and very entertaining.
positive;Porgy consists of a stellar cast and music.
negative;I was not expecting a classic, but at least a funny film.
positive;Another reason might be that although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolisms, his, unlike those of, say, Andrei Tarkovsky, are of a more elusive nature.
positive;Overall, The Qin emperor is a majestic Greek tragedy figure.<br /><br />The assassin evolves towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality.
negative;You will have no idea what is happening.
positive;Who is the blue-lady?
positive;Davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well.<br /><br />Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to shed his St.
negative;But the first ten minutes grabbed me, and I decided to give it a chance.
positive;This seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal.<br /><br />Reynolds made the film in Atlanta at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and demographic.<br /><br />The film did mark the appearance of Rachel Ward who was nominated as New Star of the Year in 1981 by the Golden Globe.<br /><br />Reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home, Georgia.<br /><br />I got my DVD from half.com for $7.99 and unfortunately it doesn't contain any commentary or making-of features, which is a shame.
positive;He calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late.
positive;Fit, trim with the 'Great Profile' still in evidence he commands the screen.
positive;Or so we are led to believe.
negative;"""Graduation Day"" is fun, though it isn't spell-bindingly original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable demises, but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained."
negative;The last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey!!
negative;giving human qualities to the animals is nothing new & to be expected, but changing their actual bodies into basically a transsexual figure is bizarre for a family cartoon - how many people- editors, writers, producers, animators saw this and didn't know any better or didn't say anything- it is completely astounding!
negative;I've seen a lot of very, very bad movies.
negative;Maybe as a theater-play but certainly not as a movie!
positive;The Beguiled was one of the few early Eastwood films I hadn't seen until I gave the DVD a spin today.
positive;"At first I thought there were ""Observers"" and ""the observed"", but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees."
negative;If you are going to have a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with Jet Li') you best have some great fighting to go with it.
negative;Whereas the original fed off a campy feel, this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects.
negative;Well....not really.....<br /><br />A photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and while retreating into the jungles of an Asian country, is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive, force him into slave labor, and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter.
positive;Modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness, laughter, and insight into the world surrounding them, but Jeffries' children prove otherwise.
negative;"The three women that violate him all have distinctive marks on the bodies; one has a giant birth mark on her buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on her lower stomach and the ring leader has a small circle on her breast."
negative;Virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators.
negative;When you think about it, men trying to be women is funny, men trying to be nuns is ridiculous.<br /><br />Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
negative;So, it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film.
negative;I'm having a tough time ending this rant because there is just so much badness to talk about.
negative;Unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and I'm sure he had) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a weird script.
negative;But be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it.<br /><br />PS: I almost forgot the George Bush humor.
positive;And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced).
negative;And the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot.
positive;We all like to think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriages were full of fulfilment, love, and happy memories.
positive;This seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.
negative;Where can you find guys like this?
negative;I never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re-runs.
positive;The whole cross dressing scene, as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director Michael Radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized.
negative;Do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead.
negative;Also, Ed was a small guy, scary like Anthony Perkins' character in Psycho (who was supposedly based on real-life Ed), not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in Men In Black.<br /><br />Another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned, 3 building set.
negative;Other cast members (particularly Mickey Rooney, a silver-haired Lionel Stander, and Lizabeth Scott) do very well in colorfully outr√© roles, though Al Lettieri has an insulting part as an apparent cross-dressing homosexual (Lettieri gets insulted without being able to defend himself, an unenviable position).
negative;Throughout the whole film, I never felt this was a horror film.
negative;I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one, though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going.
negative;The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that, I have to admit made me laugh, at the stupidity of it all.
positive;"I didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something good.<br /><br />There are situations that are left for your interpretation to ""find out"" what really happened so your attention is a key factor.<br /><br />The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.<br /><br />Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.<br /><br />The technical aspects are very good."
negative;It's almost as if the writer started one story, then got another idea, and attempted to mesh the two together.
positive;"""Charlie Don't Surf""."
positive;I don't recall a film which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war, as mirrored in one single marital relationship.
negative;Ms Rubins Character is at first innocent, then sexy, as she plays Stephen Baldwin's Character (Travis)for a fool.
negative;I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie.
positive;Very short but this one kind of blows the film's momentum.<br /><br />RIGHT BRAIN/MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane representations of religious imagery that I have ever seen and it totally kicks ass.
negative;It was so predictable.
negative;I'm accustomed to being patient with films because I've generally found it usually pays off.
negative;Furthermore, the script is beyond pitiful.
positive;The location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, making it just that much more realistic.
positive;What if the father had done it?
positive;I find some connections with the Greek tragedy tradition, too.<br /><br />The emperor, extraordinarily acted, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hate of his subjects and kins) as his destiny.
positive;Laura Harring has the requisite Hayworthesque allure as Camilla/Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role.
positive;I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act.
negative;The cheating was amateur stuff.
negative;It was simply a prop to be used, neglected, scorned, abused, coveted and disposed of on a whim.
positive;The gruesome monster make-up effects were engineered by Rick Baker, and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though it's all carried out with a good sense of fun.
negative;"First the easy part: this movie is pretentious crapola!<br /><br />It put me in mind of ""Magnolia""."
negative;"And third; there's some weird-@$$ werewolf cult intent on taking over the world!"
positive;In case you can get your hands on the recently restored German version, you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action.
negative;Well, you're wrong because he's in it as Reggi's father (another wasted talent).<br /><br />The film might not have been so bad had their not over-killed the writing behind Deol's character.
negative;My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo.
positive;The most kick ass song they made is also on there (Sic).
negative;"Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing ""Killer Eye"")<br /><br />Grade: D-"
positive;Nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now, these many years later.<br /><br />It's all too sadly familiar, and one wishes there were an Addicus of our day to make it all right.
negative;Now that is a cool part about this film !
positive;After escaping the clutches of the murderers, Billy informs the authorities, only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act.
negative;Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before.
positive;It's particularly hard for a director to capture film-making without getting precious, inbred, over-dramatic, or all three.
negative;I am a pretty much a sucker for those Ghost Hunter shows.
negative;The movie is just not worth it.
positive;Jeff Ho.
negative;Korine's established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker.
negative;"along the history of cinema, there's been a few films that deceived the viewer, such as hitchcock's ""stage fright"", alejandro amen√°bar's ""abre los ojos"", David fincher's ""the game"" and this one ""ausentes"" (""absent"")."
positive;How do you know if a movie is good or not?
positive;This was a show I rarely missed.
negative;"Especially when ""Paranormal State"" was juxtaposed against a weak Monday Night Football game.<br /><br />By the end of the pilot of ""Paranormal State"" when the main ""character"" in this reality dance macabre gives a Creepy Kid a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and reassures him by telling this boy that he, too, had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that ""came out of the closet"" and the (Catholic) Church gave him a Holy Water to fend off the Things Coming Out of the Closet I knew I should have given Monday Night Football another shot.<br /><br />The shtick behind ""Paranormal State"" is a group of Penn State students all got together and started their own Ghost Hunting club."
negative;"I actually blurted out loud, ""Are you kidding me?!"""
positive;In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel.
positive;"But Cox's script focuses chiefly on Ramsey's path to redemption, as his hedonistic lifestyle is thrown into disarray by Sandvoss' influence, and by the responsibilities which emerge as a consequence of his developing maturity: He volunteers as an outreach participant, delivering food to AIDS patients living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy Erik Palladino (TV's ""er""), whose illness provides Ramsey with a much-needed wake-up call.<br /><br />Cox's script is laced with juicy one-liners and various pearls of wisdom (on Mormonism: ""Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals?"
positive;The film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it.
negative;First, let me start off by saying this film SOUNDED very interesting: A serial killer copycatting the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers of all time).
positive;And that alone makes it very much worth seeing.
positive;The main score--which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying--is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel.
positive;At least Connery's mature 007 didn't swing through the jungle emitting a Tarzan yell.
negative;This movie is so bad it's worth seeing.
positive;"I found myself turning to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say, ""that's exactly what happens in India!"
negative;***May contain spoilers***<br /><br />I had very high expectations for this film, based on the trailer.
negative;Now it can talk in English and has the doctor's memories.
positive;I think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy.
positive;I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the film!<br /><br />Of course, if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn't your style, you wouldn't like this.
negative;The script actually seemed a bit better than the film, and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over it's lines.
positive;We have Antonio, who is a young man living in Nordestina, a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of Brazil, and who is deeply in love with Karina.
negative;His directing is OK, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good.<br /><br />In conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the blandest, most boring movie I've seen all year.
positive;However, this is not the real issue.
positive;You would do wise to seek out Nuovomondo/The Golden Door (or whatever it's being titled in your area).
negative;He is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but Jack Cole doesn't seem to be who everyone thinks he is until Jack's ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well.
negative;"And to think, it's considered a ""cult"" classic."
negative;No need for a flight engineer on this complex plane!
positive;very good.
positive;In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home.
negative;At about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the U.F.O.
negative;I have the whole package on VHS but I don't think it's a big privilege.
negative;There was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that Noah can't act.
negative;During the movie, I expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.<br /><br />While I'm a fan of both actors, I do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or, perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries.
negative;"With sister in toe, Kerman & Agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the ""Green Inferno"", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites.<br /><br />One in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures."
positive;I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who does home.
negative;"Don't bother watching it; believe me, you're better off.<br /><br />Long and short of the plot: a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children."
positive;Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic.
positive;This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies.
positive;<br /><br />With its frothy blend of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags, 'Hi-De'Hi' was a big hit for B.B.C.-1 in the '80's, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins.
positive;I'm happy to report it still stands the test of time.
positive;Good luck Rachael!
positive;Then again, I like Rachael Ray.
positive;I can't wait to get them to re-live the great memories!
positive;It's a wonderful film.
negative;The tedious overacting takes itself so seriously that it's nearly hypnotic, and to be clear I mean that in a bad way.
negative;She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.
positive;<br /><br />There were moments in your film, many, like at least seven, where I was struck by such a great amount of beauty, emotional beauty, that I actually couldn't breathe for a while.
negative;Highlander?
positive;The supporting cast also performs well, notably with a performance from David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame as a seasoned Soviet agent.<br /><br />The film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in.
negative;Could be the script as well hard for me to say?
positive;Interesting details, hastily pasted in.
negative;I've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience.
positive;"In the meantime, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don't worry, the same trio came back in ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"")."
negative;"The credits at the end read ""ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya""."
negative;This movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons.
negative;With that being said, it does have a miniscule amount of good parts.
positive;A second added there.
negative;).
negative;When a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience.
positive;Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.<br /><br />It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences.
positive;Amateur camera work aside, I thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts I have read, I got something totally different out of the ending than others.
positive;Binodini's idealism does not come across, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
positive;This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography.
negative;It was amazing compared to this horrible film (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious).
negative;"When the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like ""I overheard him say so on the phone,"" and ""I think I got a plan,"" we really are in trouble."
negative;"""Tammy"" and ""Patty,"" suitably named, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood.<br /><br />4."
negative;<br /><br />The movie wasn't boring, well for me it wasn't.
positive;The comparisons are unmistakable.
negative;"You herd it through the grapevine from the MooCow first: ""From Hell it Came"" is a compost classic!!"
negative;Movies about U.F.O.
negative;I love the moment when Simmons ominously tells someone what chupacabra stands for: Goat eater!
negative;I got to know √ÜON back in the early 90s via television and I loved it...<br /><br />What did you like about it ?
negative;I'll give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes.
negative;Writer-director Mike Hodges has the germ of a good idea (satirize the detective movies of the 1940s without compromising the hard-boiled talk and milieu), but he hasn't a very sharp sense of humor.
positive;I have seen this play many times, from Olivier to Branagh, and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory.
positive;Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations.
positive;"it is my belief that ""a Season in Purgatory"" is in fact a fictionalized account of the same crime.anyway,for me,Murder in Greenwich"" is an 8/10"
negative;Fuji resort?
negative;I know a lot of people would claim certain films as 'the worst of all time' but I think Redneck stakes a claim for this prize.
positive;Sally Kellerman tosses off a fine performance but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the Himalayas.
negative;Comedy?
negative;"However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly."
negative;A bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own.
positive;It doesn't do any good.
positive;whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider.<br /><br />At the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect.
negative;Drab, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects.
positive;Satisfaction guaranteed!
negative;Furthermore, they do this without making Islamists the enemy AND without making Republicans the enemy, since it's the Republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing, bringing down the USSR by covertly supplying a war in Afghanistan.<br /><br />But seriously now .
positive;It has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand.<br /><br />I question the casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with a 100 IQ.
negative;Sorry but I just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair-do, glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely NO physical fighting whatsoever (frankly, his best asset).
positive;There were certain things that could have made it better.
positive;In this episode a man who has been thinking about the possibility, finds himself at the date and location of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
positive;Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
positive;The depictions of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumbling agent Small-Fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick.<br /><br />Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors.
negative;The recurring puppet shows are pointless, and a few scenes are completely out of place.<br /><br />That said, there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the film.
negative;Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot.
negative;I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes.
negative;None of us knew what to expect, and by the end, none of us were pleased.<br /><br />Yes, there are breathtaking images.
negative;On the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice.
positive;Their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale.<br /><br />The brutal rape of Meethi (Konkona), seems somewhat unnecessary.
positive;See the movie, open the gift.
negative;"She was the only one who liked it for the following reason: ""At least a film with no cars screeching..."" If you are looking for a war-film with no fighting in it, is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti-war-message, then you should watch ""The Trench"".<br /><br />I give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoon-nap and because I am too nice..."
negative;I'm amazed that so many people-- especially other gay men-- have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in jail, doing time for child abuse.
negative;Poor Peter Johnson.
negative;Oh, we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out, but that's about it.
negative;It is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman, since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to, but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks, and he's very upset about this.
positive;And me personally...I loved the end.
positive;Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eyepatch, SPECTRE ring or a boring uniform.
positive;She's assigned to tough-as-nails boss, Joan Crawford, who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades.
positive;I have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why I have given it a 10!
positive;with many of the residents used as extras.
negative;How about making this movie a little believable.
negative;Shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy.
positive;Well, that is something.
positive;Once gained power, he has to be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.)
positive;"This is more of a theme that American audiences could have more of ¬ñ more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining secluded to your own events.<br /><br />Overall, I loved ""Railway Children""."
negative;If you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes, without either shooting your TV or committing mass homicide, then give a shot.
negative;Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters.
positive;Considering this film was released 8 years before I was born, I don't feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time.
negative;Real professional.
positive;Maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her.
positive;I loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn out scenes.
negative;These actors are horrible.
negative;A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption.
positive;The acting is on a high level.
negative;Then it hit me an hour ago.
negative;I never intended to write a review of this movie.
negative;Two-thirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the film's hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and college student, as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger.
negative;Okay, we have thousands of (mostly) men who worked for years to make a really big boom.
negative;And penguins cant fly!
negative;The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors.
positive;Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women desire, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir).
positive;This is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewers.<br /><br />The film kicks off with a short called OVARIAN EYEBALL.
negative;"A pointless exercise in how to waste film, ""Graduation Day"" is an utter disgrace to horror cinema."
negative;That was (thankfully) changed.<br /><br />A real lousy, sick film.
negative;There were also a few lines that deserved a laugh, and a couple suspenseful scenes.
negative;It wasn't really anything.
positive;Being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind, but still, this isn't a bad movie by any means.
positive;"I believe that she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress."
negative;Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around the town, Rajat Bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double penetrating Monisha Korella (How did they think this was straight?).
negative;"The special (""Short bus"" kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed."
positive;I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece.
negative;"but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find.<br /><br />I think my biggest pet peeve was how the police/FBI acted.<br /><br />For example: Black FBI Agent: ""Okay, endangered female, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be."
negative;ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience.<br /><br />Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla fest, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA vs. VIRAS, made an appearance.
negative;Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles--Gordon especially.
positive;A bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump, to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter.
positive;The plot is outstanding as well.
negative;"The campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of ""Evil Dead"" or ""Army of Darkness""; a fun, gory, 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters."
positive;"Also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since ""house of Flying Daggers"".<br /><br />The movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner."
positive;I pitied Carrie-Anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys.
positive;The Wildey gun packs a big punch and when Kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it.<br /><br />And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader?
negative;So the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to.
negative;Maybe she needed the money.<br /><br />If I can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe I will feel vindicated.
negative;I mean, Master P as a cuban godfather!
positive;There seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-sprawl Meister, James Howard Kunstler.
negative;Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for, but the movie was cheap and pointless, and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should've done it.
negative;But that's Hollywood!<br /><br />The picture almost works but misses the mark, primarily due to MacMurray's performance.
negative;"Also, she likes it a little rough."""
negative;<br /><br />I'll summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating.
negative;Because all the things i laughed at when i was younger, is no longer funny.
positive;Living just down the Hwy from Georgetown, Co...I remember this movie well and thought it was great!
positive;So if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny.
negative;"It's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap film, only to make a few bucks because of the ""Snakes on a Plane"" craze."
negative;This movie sucks.
negative;"And, in case you're wondering, I'm a dude.<br /><br />Listen, Comedy Network: though your existing original programming is already, shall we politely say, of a 'questionable' quality (I'm looking at you, ""Girls Will Be Girls"") you have truly outdone yourselves on this one."
negative;"Bad use of music: what's the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse?<br /><br />And to all the people who claimed the main prize in Venice, I answer:""Are you nuts????"""
positive;<br /><br />Overall, I think it was worth my time.
positive;Yes, I saw the failings of Wilkinson's character-his aim for perfection, the desire for everything in its place-but in Emily Watson, she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness, to realize what she has thrown away.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson makes SEPARATE LIES into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment, and despair on the screen as his wife goes off with another man.
negative;Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper.
positive;"Rickman is sexy and good, but the ""stranger"" is less convincing - Reedus is sort of sexy, but he is not a consistent actor - this could be the director's fault in this case - we are supposed to find him alluring in the extreme just because he is ""pretty"" - but that's not enough."
positive;However, I still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation.
negative;"This film focused on the ""freak"", as her symbol for artistic and personal empowerment, in a really shallow and predictable fashion."
positive;There are so many twists and additional sub-plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but, trust me, this gem is worth checking out.
positive;The history of TV to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place.
positive;Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival, it has an excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance.
negative;'<br /><br />The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out `Look at me!
negative;3) A couple that shag too loudly.
positive;The romance and the resolution especially.
negative;I won't even mention the numerous instances of terrible CGI.
negative;Bottom of the barrel.
positive;He gave us the awesome (at it's time)Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson to super stardom.
negative;In the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic.
positive;She does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of James Bond ready to take on all comers.Cleopatra is overawed by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be.
negative;<br /><br />He also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of: -All (read: most) of the names are significant.
positive;When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the Charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular.
positive;Veteran character actor Richard Carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer Herman Wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, specially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer.
positive;Occasionally she gets very brief visits from her harried husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the meddling Coburn at bay.
negative;"<br /><br />A long opening, with laughably straight 1960s couple Ralph Baker Jr. (as Chris) and Dorothy Davis (as Judy), suggests ""Night Fright"" might be a joyously bad movie; but, don't get your hopes up."
negative;Wow!
negative;There is plenty of silicon-enhanced nudity, but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever, making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind.<br /><br />My guess is that most people who watch this film, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated.
negative;And the movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN'S aunt.<br /><br />-WHERE DID AXEL GO?
negative;<br /><br />I'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes, AVOID this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that ISN'T stuck up its own @$$.
positive;For those of you who don't live in Denver...every Christmas, the city of Denver, Co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the Civic Center in downtown Denver.
positive;The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly.
positive;The film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of Asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.<br /><br />Overall, Noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night.
positive;Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness.
negative;The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down).
positive;"That is, I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades."
negative;No character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the Icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in English.
positive;"One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then ""Prosper Merimee's"" well-known story about ""Carmen."""
negative;Several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city.
positive;"Considering the fact that I thought I was in love and I was the same age as the youths in this film at the time (although I realize they are now old enough to be my parents), plus the soundtrack being written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin just before they ""made it big"" here in North America..."
positive;The End Of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful film.
positive;"Then I watched ""The Making of EIGHTEEN"" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell.<br /><br />So, I thought I'd watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director's Commentary."
negative;In fact, half of this movie isn't even on film at all.
positive;In the second movie, Mr. Bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny.
negative;I counted up to 45.
positive;I am so, so sorry.<br /><br />Luck Child - not as sophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very clever in its own right.
positive;It has taken him seven years to make this.
negative;There just wasn't anything here to like.<br /><br />I realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student.
positive;"<br /><br />While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in."
positive;LATTER DAYS <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />Trouble flares when an LA party boy (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a handsome Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss).<br /><br />A huge hit on the festival circuit and on limited theatrical release, this likable movie - the feature debut of screenwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise in 'opposites attract', in which Ramsey's shallow-minded character is changed forever after falling hard for vulnerable beauty Sandvoss, who is constrained by the dictates of his religious convictions.
negative;That was it for me!
positive;He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture.
negative;There is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this, and without any apparent reason.
negative;The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting.
positive;I must say I didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well, and I think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life.
positive;"Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's ""Working Girl""."
negative;Sam's substitute brother Jack(Matthew Linhardt)is supposed to look out for him, but decides to sleep with new love-interest Beth(Samantha Aisling)instead.
negative;While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script.
negative;way of thinking.
negative;i'm no snob & I luv animation- simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even ice age & all the other new ones out there - over the hedge was great- but this is nuts - totally nuts- i could not accept that that many people are that ignorant & i kept hoping for a reason for the udders in the film - an explanation - none came - and at the end when they hold up this little newborn calf & half its belly is udder & they pronounce 'its a boy' i nearly choked!!!!
positive;I do agree with the critics that Chris Farley was no John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no John Belushi, or John Candy but he was very funny.
negative;They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out.
positive;Hence, this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivities, and not a depressing black reality tour of the human nature.
positive;It came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish.
negative;It's sad to see that this is a much worse film.
positive;And Sir Ian McKellen?
positive;I wasn't expecting much but wow, was I ever surprised.
positive;All she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant, with one brief rage attack.
negative;"""I want to ejaculate on your bozonkas.""?"
negative;Could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature?
positive;Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she made THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.<br /><br />The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction.
positive;What a fun bunch they must be.
negative;"or ""All BETTS are off!"""
negative;The acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me.
negative;A lot of the juiciest bits are cut-aways.
negative;Well see this film and you'll realise it isn't.
negative;This, however is not enough.
negative;The crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog?
positive;At that time Russell Crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and I had no idea it was him until I saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming..... amazing...
positive;I found it credible, moving and at times upsetting.
negative;"""Make Them Die Slowly"" is about what you'd expect from an Umberto Lenzi-directed jungle potboiler¬ñinventive (yet poorly rendered) native torture techniques, some ridiculous ""social commentary"" (yes, even sillier than ""Cannibal Holocaust""), and lots of guts being chewed."
negative;Aside from looking hideous, her penchant for over analysis of relationships is cringe worthy.
negative;It doesn't even come close to being funny.
positive;My knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer, but I had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase.<br /><br />As I saw the movie, those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing, with some apparently inexplicable details.
positive;All-in-all a well done film.
negative;"I mean, the warden (with a hot tub in his office; wonder what he told the contractor?"
negative;Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think.
positive;Mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of Jed, the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods'.
positive;While Josh Duhamel is very funny and lets face it, he looks like he can take down anyone.<br /><br />Vanessa Marcil and Nikki Cox add that special touch.<br /><br />The story lines are very fun and weird at times.<br /><br />You can easily just relax into this show and doesn't bring the heavy story lines like the other shows that rule the ratings...
positive;Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there.
negative;BUT Not in this case, they spent some money and it shows.
negative;I always thought of her as more matronly, but then surely that's a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins.
negative;The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness.
negative;Boy Oh Boy, does this movie stink.
positive;Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she's candy for the eye although she's most of the time in her white clothes.<br /><br />The fear factor is almost inexistent but there's plenty of mystery and tension to dig from.<br /><br />I would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers.
negative;Coincidentally, the Nazi's felt the same towards the Jews.
positive;The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clich√©s doesn't help.
positive;"As a gay man growing up in a small town, I related SO well to the ""big secret"" and the choices I made."
negative;The foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer.
positive;They were both very funny most of the time.
positive;It so happens that back about 1979, director Robert Altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards--if he doesn't break his neck--will make the first movie.
negative;A young man falls in love with a princess but then has to go to battle to save her father's kingdom.
negative;"It looks like an old 80's sci-fi movie complete with super-fake looking ""special effects"", queer imagery, and very cheesy dialogue."
positive;Or how about the way Ghuillotene threw his fingernails to make explosions!
positive;An entire scene added here.
positive;In both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or chopped up and reordered.
negative;And the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on...
negative;OK, I've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did.
negative;"And, oh, what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be.<br /><br />Did I mention Ryan narrates the entire episode of Paranormal State in a star date-less ""director's log"" voice over?"
positive;Furthermore, Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public, and everybody thinks Lance has reassigned Holloway out of jealousy.
positive;"Yes ""Coneheads"" was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and ""Black Sheep"" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made."
positive;Odd to see Harris playing the role, too, since he has a long resume of playing nasty, profane characters.<br /><br />Anyway, I never complain about a nice, feel-good film, and it is nice to see a bunch of well- meaning, kind people.
positive;Some TV programs continue into embarrassment (my beloved 'X-Files' comes to mind.)
positive;Since December 2003, I have seen only five films as great as EIGHTEEN.
negative;Nice comment right?
positive;I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach!
negative;Hockey hair does not belong in a WWII movie.
positive;The setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too, and there's little sub-stories, like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes, since this co-ed work crew is evenly matched.
positive;"Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant.<br /><br />""Sex Is Comedy"" allows Ms. Breillet to give us her own take on films in general."
positive;This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see.
positive;"While I can't say whether or not Larry Hama ever saw any of the old cartoons, I would think that writing said cartoons, file cards, and some of the comics would count for something.<br /><br />For fans of the old cartoon, this is pretty much a continuation of the same, except with a few new characters - and a more insane Cobra Commander.<br /><br />We still have all the old favorites too, but on a personal note, one thing that always irritated me was this ""Duke in charge"" stuff, when there are tons of other *officers* around instead.<br /><br />The battle sequences are similar to the old series as well; the main trick here seems to be the CGI."
negative;The MooCow says avoid this corpse of a film, and find something that mooves at moore of a full...throttle.
negative;They're designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill.
positive;Actors have a good time , especially Middleton and Lipson.
positive;I didn't know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70's soft-core peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girls in the South.
positive;I recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept, and/or wants to know about how they put the first one together.
negative;However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.
positive;The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze.
negative;As it turns out Adam doesn't have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr. Norwell.
negative;It makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie, but I've never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better.
negative;"A very hyped-up, slick, edgy reinterpretation.<br /><br />They've fallen into the ""because it's modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc."""
positive;I needed something to calm me a little, something to pass the time, other than, of course, The Matrix.
negative;"It¬¥s a long way from the wonderful ""Les enfants du paradis""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative;If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.<br /><br />So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this?
negative;This movie was noted as one of Fangoria's 101 greatest movies you've never seen... well Fangoria is half-right in the case of Luther the Geek.
negative;Hollywood needs to let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future.
negative;)?
negative;I'll quit now since I'm at 700 words.
positive;I personally would rather forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To a Kill!<br /><br />The Eon folks can sneer at this film if they like.
positive;Geena Davis also gives a great preformance as Samantha Caine/Charlie Baltimore.
positive;In other words, is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity?
negative;The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot 'em up.
negative;This is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing.
positive;The testing in the Kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests any martial art school requires.
negative;I saw this on the Sci-Fi Channel so I knew it would be bad to start with but I was surprised at how much worse it was than expected.
negative;This piece of junk is a badly filmed, way too long film.
negative;"The Tabonga is arguably the slowest monster in moovie history, right up there with the clanky, over-built robot from ""Robot Monster vs the Aztec Mummy"" and the perversly slow carpet monster from ""Creeping Terror""."
positive;The script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including Lorenzo and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Busey.
positive;A great flick with lots of laughs .
positive;perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes, adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride.
positive;"Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'.<br /><br />The period setting occasionally caused problems; in one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark."
positive;Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.
positive;This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable.
negative;Most unsatisfying.<br /><br />As with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks.
negative;Wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson, (the adulterous wife), and Rupert Everett, (the highly amoral high-class totty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material.
negative;"Some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a ""young fella,"" where it appears to me that he's just as old as the other older actors.<br /><br />And if that's not silly enough, there's a rather significant script problem in this film."
negative;Okay, first of all, I missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed credits and stuff.
positive;This is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes, 'Sapsorrow' and 'The Soldier and Death' being examples of more dramatic episodes.<br /><br />Side note: Greek Myths.
positive;"They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'Once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />Hrebejk's people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand."
negative;When I am in the right mindset, I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time.
positive;"What a shame to see fine thought-provoking films like Four Friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to IMDb's ""filters""."
negative;Of course in real life, he wouldn't want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either.
negative;""", I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to show up!"
negative;The pacing is mind-numbingly slow, and the soft-focus-lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly.
negative;In fact, I want my money back.
positive;But he's not aiming at you.
positive;I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended.
negative;He's just forced to amuse himself.<br /><br />The crippled plane, leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans won't make it back to Hawaii so Masters will try to land at an Air Force base located on an island.
negative;What kind of writer did they have on this film?
positive;I should mention that for a good majority of the movie, it is surprisingly faithful to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy.
positive;The celebration on Times Square as well as everywhere else in the United States suggests a national zenith!!!
negative;With all the potential for a good movie in its gorgeous settings, cast, and cinematography, this film's lacklustre script, leaden pace, and wooden performances produced only a major disappointment.
negative;Once again, I am impressed by the laugh-ability factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman.
negative;And boy oh boy I hated the reason why.
positive;I enjoyed this a lot.
positive;"""I am f___ing Bule."""
negative;And there's a scene with Miriam in the actual tacky Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade, which must have been filmed Xmas, 1968.<br /><br />Gale Sondergard is old, old, old.
negative;The impossibly non-overridable command from the nuke box.
positive;The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope.
positive;By contrast, Sex Is Comedy raises plenty of laughs, mainly by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks.
negative;The whole mess was shot in the Phillipines who were getting their own film industry started.<br /><br />Nice location photography in the Phillipines is all that Black Mama, White Mam has to recommend it.
negative;First,I can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.Because,.it's unbelievably bad movie!
positive;This intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in Faces¬ói.e., Seymour Cassel cramming his hands down Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose¬ójust as the actors' utter conviction here yields blisteringly honest moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coital assessment of their relationship and Ben's revulsion at a black woman's touch as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-loathing.
positive;As for the stepfather, it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face.
negative;:) If you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids, you're WAY better of opting for the squirrel!<br /><br />The start of this film was a bit funny, and set some good premises for the happenings to take place.
negative;"I remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot."
positive;It's not the usual hope-producing, tissue moistening idiocy.
positive;The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end.
negative;While Norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham-fisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like Chuck.
negative;"<br /><br />Most importantly, he doesn't know much about the real world of BDSM and chose to create the typical ""Hollywood Reality"" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous.<br /><br />Save your time, money and braincells and pass this one by."
negative;The first film is somewhat good to me, I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought it was really nothing all that special.
positive;This show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a Greek drama.
negative;Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being.
negative;The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora.
positive;He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor.
negative;"Even though ""dog"" is in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers.<br /><br />Scott Caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend/cad."
positive;"In the Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, reminded me why it is that I love ""going to the movies."""
negative;Is it the lame sub-par juvenile humor?
negative;I seriously don't know what the hell David Bradley began smoking after making Hard Justice, which in my opinion, was quite a good movie after the American Ninja features.
negative;I liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters.<br /><br />If this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didn't make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them, it might have made for a more enjoyable experience.
negative;When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris.
negative;I grew up in Brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent 5 years in Rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place... Shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in Rennes.
negative;The only positive I can say about it is that thankfully I didn't pay to see it.
positive;Chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but, at this point in time, he was certainly above average.
positive;I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released.
positive;In between, I watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example.
negative;I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it.
positive;John woo's Hardboiled.
positive;Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal,Munnabhai series and Herapheri series.
positive;On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, is given much less attention in the film.
positive;Sharp angles are utilized, as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.<br /><br />The real feats, however, are those instances of the long shot.
positive;Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books.
negative;"The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) ""borrowed"" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine."
negative;"i've a good show about terrorism, its called "" The Whitehorse"" and bush himself the cell leader, its the same with 24, how ever 24 was good, sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2, its F***** joke!"
negative;Not here.
positive;Their allegorical performances, under Shepitko's sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story.<br /><br />******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
positive;"I think that New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best one line review of In the Mood for Love when he said that it is ""dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever."""
negative;Coen Brothers-wannabe from writer-director Paul Chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other (better) movies, yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching.
negative;The central female lead is easy on the eyes, and could actually act.
positive;I am sooooo stunned by the quality of the aforementioned Russian war movies that I cannot find the words to praise enough their shattering superiority over Anglo-Saxon war movies.
negative;This is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone's life, it is tedious, vacuous and hammy, and, almost as an afterthought, it is morally repugnant.
positive;suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse an inane U.S. import.
positive;Hilarious, Sellers at his funniest ... a shame you can't get this on video, or even see it on TV anymore ...
negative;(On the other hand, about halfway into the film, we see a close-up shot of a handbill advertising an estate auction.
negative;Please.
positive;"One day the bottle blew the cork plum apart."""
positive;I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.
positive;<br /><br />The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness.
negative;The ending is also pitifully predictable...the classic bait and switch caper in which the good guy turns out to be the bad guy.
negative;But you'd be surprised how many movie-critics and film students love boredom in movies so I hotly recommend Erice's 10-minute snooze-fest to those two groups of humanoids.<br /><br />Herzog: Not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in South America.
positive;What makes the movie so great?
negative;I didn't get the slightest hint at any point that Solo ever possessed any redeeming character, which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days.
positive;version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group.
positive;"Films like ""Love, Actually"" or ""Vicar of Dibley"" demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns, places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be neighborly."
positive;I related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some.
negative;Yes - the children are sweet.
negative;The accent and speech rhythm of the 'bad guys' is so bad it's funny.. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you are a big time fan one of the actors.
negative;Moral of the story: avoid movies that are acted, directed, edited, produced and written by the same nobody.
positive;What does that entail for you?
negative;I was sorely disappointed.
negative;The morals of the story were PC to the max.
negative;I was disgusted and didn't laugh once.
negative;"The even name the dog ""Shoeshine"" (in reference to the dog being ""Shoeshine Boy"" in the cartoon)."
negative;Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen), this film isn't very good.
positive;Recently released on British DVD, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and IQ of more than a fruit fly).
positive;Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no commentaries.
negative;"It's an all-out assault on the senses featuring ""in your face"" dinosaurs."
negative;He should be ashamed.
positive;"I didn't know a lot about this film going into it but I did find out that Kane was a wrestler, which didn't exactly thrill me but hey, I liked ""Santa's Slay"" and that had a wrestler in it, so what the hell."
positive;You might like it.
negative;The precise location of this film's story is never disclosed, but - judging by the actors' accents - I'd place it as somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps Warwickshire.<br /><br />The plot, what there is of it, involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times (over a couple of decades) between two rival families, one wealthy and one working-class.
negative;"Major Masters has his name pirated from 80's movie ""To Live and Die in L.A."" from character played by Willem Dafoe."
positive;Marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn.
negative;Why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me, but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get Ruth Gordon back to reprise her role.
positive;If I had the cash, I'd grant him $75,000 a year living expenses and match any funds raised for his next film.
negative;It's a watchable 60 minutes in itself, I guess, but the standards have considerably lowered when compared even to the two previous entries, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable.
negative;But even considering that, the sets and effect are bad.
positive;Duckman was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago.
negative;If you are familiar with his work, please post something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be.
negative;These actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all.
positive;Support this film and support Jeskid, he is a very talented guy.
negative;When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining.
positive;), war movies like this one, or The dawns here are quiet, or Proverka na dorogah... And , right after that, watch again the American war movies, or the international productions, those one with the allies and the Germans,etc.
positive;For the morally enraged stomach it is great running to the toilet to barf material.
positive;"What makes this documentary special from a film-making perspective is its passiveness; which engages the audience to bask in the delight of gypsy music."
negative;Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie.
negative;Laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde have sex with Horatio at an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks goats' blood and is possessed during an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rapes Laura.
positive;The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney himself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I believe, the only animated Disney film since the 1940's which is NOT based on an earlier book or other work, but is rather an original story).
positive;Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen.
negative;Then, if you change something in the past, the future will be different in the same instant.
negative;"<br /><br />A horrible shock; I am ashamed."
positive;What 'the greater good' is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source.
negative;From his confusing and choppy story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and recycled old/tired clich√© moments, all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Party films.
negative;"This Indian film is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts off like ""King Lear,"" moves on to ""Romeo and Juliet"" in the middle section, then heads back again to ""King Lear"" for its tear-soaked finale.<br /><br />Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life: a wife who adores him, a family who loves him, and a job from which he is about to retire after a lifetime of faithful service."
positive;And she can sing too!
negative;Otherwise, steer clear of EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
negative;"Barabara Eden went on to play "" Genie "" on T.V."
negative;I have nothing against sick, black humor but come on...there HAS to be some limits!
positive;I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie.<br /><br />I don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore.<br /><br />The movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty.
positive;Why is it never shown on TV or movie theaters?
positive;He's made nothing but rubbish... until now.
negative;I can't understand why this isn't in the worst 100.
negative;If you are interested in independent movies, are easily satisfied, or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
positive;Or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work.
positive;Well, I guess I am wrong, just like other cities/ countries, they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs, fights, bad language, and .... many other obvious signs of being a bad boy.
negative;But both don't go together, because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself.
positive;It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more.
negative;"During the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release, we saw the appearance of domestic (and Canadian) films such as ""Halloween II,"" ""Prom Night,"" ""Terror Train,"" ""Madman,"" ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""The Prowler,"" ""Just Before Dawn,"" ""Final Exam,"" and ""Hell Night,"" among others."
negative;At least a full hour could be excised from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done - and quite a bit of good.
negative;I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool.
negative;It's very much made for TV stuff.<br /><br />All in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but loses them massively for being, bluntly, not very interesting at all...
negative;The monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody.
positive;<br /><br />Vito getting close with his boyhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a mob informer to win over Buddy's trust and have him tell Vito what's coming down on the streets of New York in regard to mob activities.
negative;4) Tons and tons of gore.
positive;It felt like I was watching two movies.
positive;His cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times.
positive;Cummings is playing a part that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM film) - he's handsome and very amiable, even if he doesn't have the dazzling looks of someone like Taylor.
negative;<br /><br />-VIVIAN and AIDEN meet IN HIGH SCHOOL which they both attend in the book.
positive;Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not, I don't know.
negative;They intertwine the classic music with the over-dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films.
positive;Hope CBS gives it a better time slot next season.
positive;Other notables which helped make this film believable are Murray Hamilton who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as O.W.
positive;Many people remember the Waco standoff that occurred a long time ago.
negative;I didn't expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed.
negative;If you thought Herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'The Love Bug' was daft, wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel.
positive;Ghoulies IV may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad, if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it.<br /><br />It's nice to see Peter Liapis return as Johnathan Graves who has gave up using magic and has became a Detective but still thinks about what happened in Ghoulies.<br /><br />The plot is about a woman named Alexandra that is Johnathan's ex-girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem, using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named Faust that is Johnathan's dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and John is sent to hell.<br /><br />Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one, as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little Ghoulies named Lite and Drak appear.
positive;This movie should be released on video.
positive;The word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task.
negative;And almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant is going to happen but it never does.<br /><br />The result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more silly when we learn the fate of the kidnapper.<br /><br />This is garbage:<br /><br />2 out of 10.
positive;If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.
negative;Well I would not recommend this film to anyone unless they were going to have it muted and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era, or the way homes were kept at the time.
positive;The existential doubling and quest motifs are more European myth than American (resembling another British Harvey Keitel movie, THE DUELLISTS).<br /><br />Most astonishing is the use of nature.
positive;Things don't exactly play out as planned.
positive;However, it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle.
positive;"The characters, especially ""Nitro"", ""Sonar"" and ""Stepanik"" are hilarious."
negative;Do not waste your time on this film, even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia, as I did.
positive;Nelson's lack of `objects' reflect our lack of knowledge about his past.
negative;Common sense right?
negative;Or don't, but you've been warned.<br /><br />Sorry for the super-long review.
negative;Nobody speaks.
negative;"Eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the ""working-class"" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of Eastenders.<br /><br />This has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of Walford.<br /><br />Thus, it came to pass that Eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring Eastenders.<br /><br />Other soaps have followed in EE's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly."
negative;The task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre.
negative;It is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.
positive;A great movie.
negative;Watching this film made me wonder, just why was Universal putting out films like this?
negative;Any television program that decides to use the 'love-triangle' storyline for even a single episode is pushing it, but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable.
negative;Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes.
negative;and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies.
negative;He then offers her up some stick to smoke(yes, a freakin' stick), which she eagerly agrees!
negative;The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism.
positive;The fight sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as over the top as Rocky films.
negative;Having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained.<br /><br />What exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks?
positive;Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films.<br /><br />I found Ghoulies IV to be good but this film may not go for everyone, check it out if you like low budget films like Troll 2.
negative;From the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us.
positive;It was supposed to expose Hilton's novel in a completely different way.
negative;The plot is about an amnesty that the governor of New Mexico gives to all willing criminals to provide them a chance to start a new life.
positive;The setting of this movie is in the city of love which is Paris in France.
positive;A very potent drama of Faulkner's small town south dealing with an innocent black man's murder of local ne'er do wll.
negative;"I have no problem with WWII movies or killing Nazis; I saw Defiance and like it very much."
positive;From the touching moments to the villains, this one is a winner!
negative;So he's out of the war.
positive;It's good to see it's available to rent at one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic.
positive;The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally, either.
positive;As he said himself, 'It couldn't have happened to a nicer fella'.
negative;What I wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small.
positive;Yet, Sutherland plays him with a hint of insecurity that lends him a certain appeal.
positive;The climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer.
negative;In conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done, also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great, i just wanna hug his Lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft.
positive;I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before.<br /><br />I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.<br /><br />The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.
positive;There really is nothing not to like about this film.
negative;Everyone else seemed complete separated from the picture.
negative;I am amazed this is rated as high as it is.
positive;She plays Veronika, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and without preoccupations, with plans of getting married.
positive;"But in the end, everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck, ""sorte nula"" in Portuguese."
negative;This is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh.
positive;This movie is a raw, concentrated distillation of America's PRESENT political scene.
positive;He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife ( Barbara Angell ) perused Woman's Own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ).
positive;A keeper for your collection.
positive;The plot actually showed stable, loving families.
positive;i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening.
negative;Is it a worthy start for the genre?
positive;Now this is not to say this is a bad film--it certainly isn't.
negative;This is Crap.
negative;I almost forgot about the acting, it was so bad that I forgot it was there at all, nuff said.
positive;The effects were great, and the casting was brilliant.
negative;"SLOOOOOOOW, tepid, poorly produced 70's schlocker made moore cowvincing because of today's headlines; nonetheless, this film is worthy stink-fodder because of uncowvincing acting, absent direction, and silly 70's clothing(sadly, the MooCow remembers when Adidas clothing was all the rage...)."
positive;On the series itself, I though Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly.
positive;The story seems like something John would do even in real life, but there is something that I will always remember most about the movie.
negative;"And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; in this film, she's barely a blip on the radar screen.<br /><br />The whole JP3 experience was t o o m u c h. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying off, too much predictable, gratuitous violence."
positive;Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level.
positive;Every character is acted to perfection, with the exception of the ferryman.
positive;As Garbo's (very) confused father, George Marion seems truly from another time.
negative;"If you attend ""Unidentified"" and don't like it, don't say I haven't warned you."
positive;After Bakjwi, watch Let The Right One IN, it's also not what you'll expect either.
negative;I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!<br /><br />1
positive;CAUTION: SPOILERS<br /><br />Although this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience.
positive;This movie has everything going for it: Fully developed characters, a realistic portrayal of working Washington, bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely Albert Brooks.
negative;There is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak CGI) special effects.
positive;!<br /><br />j hartz
positive;The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes, which were overly drawn out, repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character.
positive;"In the opening sequence, the title is translated as ""Mirage"" and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip."
positive;It's a tender story.
negative;Adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that I can recollect.
negative;"Every time I think I've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that I think that no one could possibly find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual inane ""Undiscovered masterpiece"" ""GREAT film"" - I mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess I just watched on the new Fox/MGM/UA DVD."
negative;The make-up is just plain awful.
negative;I never believed they loved each other, which made the Belgian dudes closing voice over, quite frankly, silly.
positive;Her life will get upside down when World War II strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army.
negative;The movie is full of tension and the ending, shocking, yet somehow inevitable.
positive;"Veteran director Gordon Douglas has helmed a grim, harrowing outdoors epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure; even Lon Chaney, Jr., registers superbly as a powerful Arab trooper."
negative;This is why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will find it disappointing as well.
negative;They don't have much of any personality and I didn't care for them much.<br /><br />Some of the girls go on a camping trip for school.
negative;I thought sleeper cell was interesting, and exciting to watch, up until the last episode, when nothing happens, its F****** BS, you Americans portray Muslims as terrorists, and the Americans as hero's, its the other way around, i hate it when every American TV show ends up predictable, i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium, but i knew it would'nt, it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day, yet again, Americans are the biggest terrorists, g bush the leader of them all, he is to blame for 9/11, and I'm P***** off that you keep throwing these shows at us, which are all the f****** same!
negative;And -- for science fiction fans -- how about THIS pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum AND John Litel!
positive;I can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit.
positive;She burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister ( who is more like a daughter to her ) and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman.
negative;A fight with the boyfriend, random friends coming over to be killed.
positive;But the movie picks up steam quickly.
positive;And what a difference it makes.
negative;The writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves.
negative;CNN, but in black and white, and one-sided, of course.
positive;"The crisp black & white photography of ""Going My Way"" cinematographer Lionel Linden imbues this western a grim look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere."
positive;The actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man.<br /><br />The luminous Anne Parillaud is marvelous as Jeanne, the director.
positive;"I wept.<br /><br />Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, ""Okay, is this $800,000 or so Indie really that Great?"""
positive;<br /><br />The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion.
negative;The lissome Martian who falls for Arthur Franz is named Alita, with an Indo-European diminutive appendage, and she already knows what kissing is.<br /><br />Overall, I found it as snappy as it was intended to be, but dull too.
positive;There is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood, and Lee Majors doesn't take part in the action until the very end, that's why I gave it 9 out of 10 points.
negative;Everything else I've seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless.
positive;It is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of CGI cartoon gimmicks.
negative;It was obvious they were just killing time.
negative;I couldn't tell if this was supposed to be that stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way.
negative;- The camera-work is low key.
negative;My kids could do better movies with our video-camera.<br /><br />But maybe we just did not get the point of the movie...oh wait, my mum did.
negative;Ewww.
positive;His timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie.
negative;"and ""I hope you die first!"""
negative;Why did they take her?
negative;"so now the FBI is ""investigating"" to find this hit-man, the investigation consists of a series of unlikely information - like some random person lost his wallet and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right on the money."
positive;While I expected some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning.
negative;"Hayakawa was successful in that part of his goal; although, this film probably did not and will not appeal to most viewers, and is not the best example of its intent.<br /><br />**** The Dragon Painter (9/28/19) William Worthington ~ Sessue Hayakawa, Edward Peil, Tsuru Aoki"
negative;Also among the highlights are Bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, OK gore, and the Great Jackie Coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff.
positive;The novel also includes long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now.
negative;After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor.
positive;The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal.
positive;And where else in America can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of Pulp Fiction's Zed?
negative;At least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.
negative;If you're looking for a nice theatrical effect, skip it and watch something else.<br /><br />But if you're looking for camp-value, this is it.
positive;If you haven't seen this film, run to Wal-Mart RIGHT NOW.
positive;As spoken at the end, about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears, Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments.
positive;I always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing.
positive;No, I won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius.<br /><br />If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.
negative;Sadly, this movie did have potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed.
negative;By avoiding to see this film, not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives, but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of Ben Jago popping out at them.
positive;The music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the scenic visuals.
negative;What a crap that movie is.
positive;i think the director Ralph devito was on his way to great things , but was cut down too early , maybe because he knew too much.
negative;despite the really corny title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors, and the clich√© writing, i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen.
positive;"When I saw Barton MacLane was also in the film, I pretty much assumed he'd be the ""baddie"" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of playing jerks!"
positive;Grady Harp
negative;I'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established.
negative;Final judgement, 4 out of 10.
positive;Irony upon irony, within irony...
negative;Also, we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth.
negative;Instead, the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy... running.<br /><br />In the end I give it 4/10 stars.
negative;with the Series that started in 1964 , but for the BIG screen ??
positive;I'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her, who suffers from this mental affliction.
positive;The voice cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor(who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney's THE RESCUERS films) as Duchess, Phil Harris(Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters.
positive;He also pushes forward the theme that if not in control, man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways.<br /><br />The last chapter takes us out of the desert's blast furnace and into the more familiar Herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior.
negative;The other actors and actresses are all okay, but I am unfamiliar with them all.
positive;I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine.
positive;In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959.
positive;But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read!
positive;(Plus also, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical-as a dancer also, I've done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who've had to do both....it still cracks me up each time!!!
negative;Watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean.
negative;"Instead, we have to watch weddings go on forever, NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be ""easier"" to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.<br /><br />The most painful part of this movie is the pacing."
positive;"However, like Sean Penn's role of a mentally-challenged man in ""I Am Sam,"" an hour-and-a-half of a character like this is plenty."
positive;"But in the words of the director himself ""living is so complicated to each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor""."
negative;"Sometimes I think that somewhere in the ""Lifetime"" Channel's office complex there is a room where the writer's hang-out, with a large wheel on the wall - sort of like the Big Six ones in casinos."
negative;They should have drugged me to see it.<br /><br />The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd.
positive;"Countless ""appreciation"" sites dictate the fact that beloved Quentin Tarentino, who I admit I like, has copied many, many, many movies in the making of his first major film Reservoir Dogs."
negative;"The only connection I can find is the Monty Python one (Eric Idle in ""Nuns"", John Cleese and Michael Palin in ""Wanda"")."
negative;The movie seems to hate its main character, which makes it all the more painful to watch.
positive;All except one African , Kingsley Ofusu , who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship , but the problem is the crew are hunting him and France is still several days voyage away .<br /><br />Just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good DEADLY VOYAGE is .
negative;The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it.
negative;The fact that it starts at a canter and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing, it is heartbreaking.
positive;What you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic.
positive;An unseen woman's hand covers the supine woman's face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen out of which an eyeball stalk is extracted.
negative;i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site.
positive;Using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them.
positive;Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth.
negative;If the camera switches, the sound always stays centered.
negative;But to be a little more precise I do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be.
positive;"<br /><br />Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) slumming to a dive, where he sees ""Nini,"" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo the baker, and discovers that she is a spirited dancer."
positive;Huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because he's chasing skirts, but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt).
negative;This movie sucked.
negative;Whether it be professional or college or high school.
positive;Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry.
positive;Whilst gathering up items and objects during game-play, you can't see how each one is going to help you progress, but with a little thought and perseverance solutions present themselves, and for that the designers of CMI must be highly commended.<br /><br />10/10 for the best game I have ever played (not an exaggeration)
negative;Actually, I'm more embarrassed that I sat through the whole thing.
positive;It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.
negative;It pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing, like Evan's disregard for the environment (drives a gas-guzzling Humvee, opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house, hates animals,...), and by the end it's just over-the-top preachy on both faith and the environment.<br /><br />Why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough, but I really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever.
negative;It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made.
negative;I found the main male character who was Henry in this film out of place.
positive;We listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment.
positive;SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and thought provoking film and I could have watched Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen.
negative;Please.<br /><br />It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs.
positive;See it!
negative;This movie is horrible!
negative;This is one of the worst parody films ever made.<br /><br />Plump Fiction is not a good movie.
negative;"it is a d grade horror movie that isn't so groovy<br /><br />There are many MANY floors in this film, including the acting, the lack of actual horror, the lack of nudity (which besides the starting Nurse (porno outfit) and the still breathing nude corpse flash, there is none.<br /><br />The sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffs/tracks.<br /><br />There are your usual typical characters, the jock, the jocks woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock), the rookie cop/ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gap..or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the Pure girl.<br /><br />The make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear ""make up line""and natural skin tones, the cover art to the DVD is clearly photoshop/enhanced to make the cover more enticing as Dr chopper looks like an old ""plopper"" The scraggy women that hang around Dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this movie.<br /><br />The plot twist was VERY predictable and the abundance of bad looking FAKE limbs was laughable, what did they think,.... um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film.<br /><br />Dr chopper himself is the most stupid character created I've seen in a while, though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme Doctor and chopper (bike) and thought ""bingo"" ill make a crappy movie about that.<br /><br />I've seen worse before..... but this is just plain bad.. everything about it is bad... the lack of suspense...the lack of actual horror or character development... the lack of a decent storyline ...the only thing good about this film was when it finished."
negative;Walker would be drummed out of any police force in the US for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics.
positive;The driver, a frail cloaked figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches.
positive;Gotta love Stu, though.
positive;Truly a wonderful movie.
positive;The film itself bravely eschews dialogue for the most part, creating the kind of visual and aural tapestry Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and something few Hollywood directors would have dared.
negative;He starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth.
positive;<br /><br />On the way home Harry meets his pal Steve (Vernon Dent) who has met two nice, sweet girls who would just love to have a date.
positive;"Death Wish 5 is the best one.<br /><br />Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist."
negative;I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment.
negative;He is even so powerful, that he can fly from London to India in a matter of 10 minutes!
positive;It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide.
positive;North and Brown stick to Warren's novel for the most part and the last minute revelation--when it seems that there is no way that our heroes can survive another onslaught of Native Americans¬óis a corker!
positive;"Why this show didn't win any awards tells me the ""powers that be"" in Hollyweird don't know drama or much else for that matter."
positive;While this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt, I found the acting acceptable, and they're both cute.<br /><br />The story is pretty poor overall.
positive;"I only had an old battered VHS tape of it until I recently purchased the widescreen DVD, which also includes the hilarious, awful trailer that makes the film come across as a ""Peyton Place"" soap opera, and conveys none of the creepiness of the film.<br /><br />Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to battle with Universal Pictures to keep the original ending, and they won out; and, the film was billed as a standard Eastwood western, which it certainly is not."
negative;Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on screen.
positive;The parallels of Pip and grandfather Jason interplay every time Pip listens to the tape and lead Pip to ultimately alter his view of life and love.
positive;I wait anxiously for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
positive;Why, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice, she livened up many a film.
positive;Can Holmes decode the message Dr. Tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity, save the weapon and possibly the scientist too?
positive;Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder.
negative;"A NASA experiment involving cosmic rays has mutated an ape and turned it into an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for blood,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Or, could the creature really be a mutated alligator returning from a space-bound ""Noah's Ark""?"
negative;He, along with a bunch of morons, goes on a field trip to search for an evil Sasquatch which is believed to have attacked a plane which crashed out in the woods, or something.
negative;"The parents and children joke together, laugh together, even perform elaborately choreographed, ""spontaneous"" song-and-dance numbers together (like many Bollywood productions, ""Baghban"" is a drama interspersed with a great number - in this case, far too great a number - of musical sequences).<br /><br />Anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss can not be allowed to go unpunished for long, and that all that joy is merely the prelude to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers."
positive;After watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist doesn't accidentally punch in a wrong number!<br /><br />In addition to the rendition there are several related side stories.
positive;There's nothing more to say.
negative;When I bought this film, I expected to get a fun, 1970's exploitation film.
positive;That was a nice effect.
positive;If more guys out there took their sorry behinds to the gym for once...maybe y'all have a chance....well,...maybe.
positive;Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days.
negative;He makes sweeping gestures when he talks, and acts like he is one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle.<br /><br />There is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe.
negative;Oh yes, the plot.
negative;"Or is it that any time someone says ""Wow, that is so cool"" everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own?"
positive;So, I'd recommend the first disk to ANY music lover, and the second for the only true Zeppelin fan.<br /><br />I may be going too far here for some guitarists, but I would say after watching this, Page is certainly more creative and inventive than Hendrix.
negative;"I wonder how come there are people writing good comments on ""Reba"" ... You watch ""Friends"" , ""Married Wtih Children"" , ""Fraizer"" if you laugh at that , you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever."
negative;I believe she is fine actress.... just not in the thriller range.<br /><br />The Filming was trashy, and like I said the plot stale... though watching it I knew I was in for automatic cheese, I had NO idea how much worse this film could get...<br /><br />I highly do not recommend this movie... unless cheep Filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for
positive;First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies.
positive;He has the sort of face and voice,--open, unmannered, totally without guile--that has vanished from the earth.
negative;"Interesting cinematography, great actors do not MAKE a film; the story does."
positive;I would love to see this series on DVD, so I could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what silly (but great) stuff her mom used to watch!
positive;It is so mind-numbingly awful that it makes a hilarious view.
negative;<br /><br />One star for being a war movie, another for being WWII and one more because I'm feeling generous.
positive;I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film.
positive;It moves at a slower pace than the Korean version.The variations between both versions are so drastic, it seems like two totally different movies.
negative;Spiders, ants, praying mantis'.
negative;"-When Ben leaves on Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a ""cross"".<br /><br />I'm not making any of those up."
positive;I will say this, I related to the inner struggle of Aaron and his upbringing.
positive;"Yeah, it's romantic, yeah, it's comedic, but (in my opinion), it's better than ""She's All That"" or ""Whatever it Takes""."
negative;I have weapons!
positive;And although, admittedly, there are a few loopholes, it's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end.
positive;It's a searing indictment of the Nazis systematic murder of over 6 million Jews, and that should not be forgotten.<br /><br />But it's sad to me that her diary is being so misconstrued as anything more than that.
negative;In Hoosiers, there is not much content.
negative;<br /><br />The whole movie was like just plain wack.
negative;And why do action/martial arts actors fall knee-deep into the smelliest horse-dung when they've like reached their peak??
negative;"How's the weather?"""
negative;Despite all his troubles young Mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him.
positive;"Aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships, ""Four Friends"" is the ONLY film I've ever seen -- And I have, literally, spent *years* of my life watching films!"
positive;"I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge ""pleasure"" from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic."
positive;"Soul Calibur is more solid than it ever was... with the new character creation, and the bad-ass chronicle of the sword mode on the home version.<br /><br />The arcade version is more complete, even though the character roster is smaller than the home version, this version is definitely the more pretty of the two, eliminating all of the ""goofy/unrealistic"" fighting styles found in the home version."
positive;'s soapy drama 'The Brothers'.
negative;I actually enjoyed it for the first to third season.
positive;His seemingly effortless style in this movie make it very easy to like him and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the film!
negative;Of course, he's not to be given all the blame.
negative;"How green was ""Man Hunt?"""
negative;That would have been encouraging, if anyone were watching.
negative;WHEN DOES THE HURTING STOP?
negative;That's a preposterous idea, Anthony!
positive;"These stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to reinforce, the slow fusing of Mishima's life with his fictions, until the end(or the beginning) when like the ancient samurai he so admires, he will be at a balance of pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is a full and ""pure"" being).<br /><br />Paul Schrader wrote the screen play for ""Taxi Driver"", and directed ""Cat People""(a bizarre erotic horror film, which left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in Mishima, he comes closest to making a really excellent film.<br /><br />Whats interesting is to watch the poet, the homosexual, the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his Tuberculosis to get of of WW2 (of which he seems forever ashamed), become a body building, samurai obsessed, a-sexual, media phenomena, all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels, plays, and short stories.<br /><br />A short and sweet version is to say Mishima has no father, and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself, that he was always missing."
negative;It was worse than leave your brain at the door.
positive;"These days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there ""patriotism""."
positive;"Surprisingly though, we found an ample supply of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and the Brothers Fleischer.<br /><br />YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios/Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a prime example of just what we're talking about.<br /><br />BEING virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of the Studios of Max and Dave Fleischer before the 1941 business coup-de-tat that moved them out, bringing the new name of ""Famous"" Studios, YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP bore none of the bland plot elements that would reduce the latter day Popeye Cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie.<br /><br />WE all remember how we'd have Popeye and Olive Oyl together."
positive;These were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile.
positive;<br /><br />Disney is hesitating about releasing Song of the South.
positive;Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970.
positive;"However, IMDb has ""adjusted"" (dumbed down?)"
positive;This is a classic movie that dramatizes the plight of a man who cannot adjust to changes taking place in society and feels more and more alienated, which leads to violence.
positive;Wow!
negative;Strangely enough, the voice she's using in this film isn't too far off from her real speaking voice.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot goes like this: Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father's fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa.
negative;Stop playing to the dumb audience, please.
positive;Highly enjoyable.
negative;"You get a very bad movie called ""Alien Express"" or ""Dead Rail"" that would be more entertaining on Comedy Central's old series ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."""
negative;Nothing like the artwork on the cover box I assure you.
negative;The monsters are all fairly inventive (and done entirely in camera) and there's some great gore gags (the best being a zombies head crushed in), but after sitting through seventy-five minutes of pure tedium, fifteen minutes just isn't going to cut it.<br /><br />That's really all there is to it.
positive;"It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en sc√®ne can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible."
positive;"And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing/dubbing an actor could deliver?<br /><br />In the novel as in the film, there are two big antagonists to the ""heroine"" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck-voiced Annie Girardot, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself."
positive;Bardem was not granted his second Oscar nomination, probably in favour of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed Jammie Fox.
positive;(One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist).
negative;After a 10 year hiatus, that must have been bitter for him indeed.
negative;The dawning of the atomic age brought on an onslaught of giant creature films.
positive;The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it.
negative;The movie is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) dull.
positive;The action scenes are great here too.<br /><br />OK over to the things I didn't like.
positive;It makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help.
negative;"Okay,I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this!I thought,""I have no idea of what this movie was like,""so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD!!!!"
negative;"If it wasn't for William Smith, this could probably pass as a fund-raising film for Save the Children or some other organization that benefits the ""third world""."
positive;I cannot recommend this film highly enough.
negative;There's also that drama that you'd expect from the father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually... the three kids have no problem helping dad build an ark) that he's gone crazy and he claims God wants him to build a big boat.
positive;<br /><br />So if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing,check this movie out!
negative;"Lots of the ""humor"" in the movie is Carrel hurting himself, or another character being hurt, whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow, or getting punched by security guards, or throwing up in airplanes."
negative;The corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had.
negative;They might find some of the interviews interesting.
negative;And while by no means would I expect a low-budget trash fest like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other.
negative;C'MON !
positive;One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down.
negative;- he's dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or balls broken - 4 cheap semi-sex scenes where the white broad come out of nowhere digs the Asian superhero.
negative;What the hell are they doing in there?
negative;I would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no,not the ones you're thinking of).
positive;Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie.
negative;Even a good face lift couldn't help this movie.
positive;I like my movies a bit left of center - unpredictable and fresh.
negative;If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not.
positive;First, the specific period of the film (i.e.
positive;8/10 stars
positive;While his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help her out some, he proves to be little better in what a loser he is.
positive;Andie MacDowell is superb in her role as a reporter, as she goes from disbelief to belief.
positive;Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, skewering Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's spitting image.
positive;She is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time.<br /><br />There are some moments where I feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend almost seem written for another film, Estevez comes off as another character all together.
positive;Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor.
negative;Chuck Norris' round-house has nothing on that!
negative;That ain't art.
negative;The plot circles around a doctor (Bradley) who develops some type of Virtual Reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one.
positive;Only the James Bond love-interest scenes would do much better.<br /><br />And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum.
negative;The plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there?
negative;Whatever could have possessed them (get it?

negative;Contains Spoilers<br /><br />But if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made.
negative;With that in mind, I give it a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 I so dearly think it deserves.
positive;John Miljan is just effective as Presocott Ames, nothing amazing, but nothing really bad, and the same could be said about June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the obligatory love interest), whom is just fine.
negative;But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking.
positive;POSSIBLE SPOILER: `The Last Frontier' being a `Production Code' movie (back in the day the word `virgin' was taboo), it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature, tolerant manner.
positive;The lineup of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to listed to them play again and again.<br /><br />Songs I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight, and The Spirit of Radio were played and the 40000 plus fans there singing along and having a great time and I swear over half the audience was under 25!<br /><br />Writers who put down Rush as far as Rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco.<br /><br />Rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync,wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried.
negative;One for Sybil and another for trying to pass off Linda Blair as a sex symbol.
positive;Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas.
negative;It was garbage in so many ways that I do not know where to begin.
positive;"(Did you know there is no hyphen after ""well""?"
negative;OK, so its a low budget movie, but that should not change the story or writing.
positive;This is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of England, and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains.
positive;As a gay Man in my late 40's I have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies.
positive;Often short films try to do too little or too much with the time.
positive;unfortunately, the emptiness is also reflective of his relationships with others, a realization he comes to along his personal journey of self-discovery in this film.<br /><br />Flatliners is not your typical horror film.
negative;"Maybe if you dispose of a really high level of tolerance, ""Bloodthirsty Butchers"" is worth one viewing."
negative;A post-apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of Nun and on the way meets some cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass.
negative;Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time.
positive;They got caught up in technicalities, `Why would there be green lighting in a subway?'
negative;Turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves!
negative;When her children are eventually found after endless reports and efforts by her staff she is told by our male hero, 'Thank God they're safe, that's the main thing'.
negative;Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring.
positive;Even the fact that Ansel was killed due to his actions Vito never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned.
positive;In other words, we won't disclose our methods, so you can't question how we arrived at the score!
positive;<br /><br />Also the unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before.<br /><br />Can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended DVD.
negative;"Captive"" is right."
negative;Let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half.
positive;Nonetheless, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses.
positive;Home not only to what was then called PA, but also world-renowned Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world.
negative;There has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject, nor one that creates any real suspense.
negative;BD style.
negative;There's not a whole lot more action until the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie (which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the traveloguery).<br /><br />In my view, the only ways that a movie can really be a BAD movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid.
negative;Same as in SS.
positive;A great film in its genre, the direction, acting, most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful.
positive;Here, the path of true love is paved with hardship, not least of which is the reaction of Sandvoss' fellow Mormons to his newfound sexuality, which results in his excommunication from the church and the wrath of his indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating cameo as the boy's outraged mother).
negative;enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece.
positive;"After that, the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear.<br /><br />Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to find out that, in real life, in took years for ""Radio"" to make his transformation, not months as shown in the film."
positive;Let's hope he completes the trilogy.
negative;In fact, the visuals could easily have been left out entirely, as the story is told completely through narration.
positive;Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie.
positive;It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.<br /><br />A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought.
negative;Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure.
negative;"do we really want a movie that repeatedly says ""let's go kill some Russians!"""
positive;The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment.
negative;guys eyebrows?
positive;More detail to father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction.
positive;Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Clich√© performance or plot.
positive;The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different.
positive;There is no prequel as far as I know.<br /><br />Now, let's get The Pied Piper of Hamelin out of the way.
negative;A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script.
negative;At only one point towards the films final climax does Kokkinos give a scene the same energy and strength as her debut feature Head On had in droves.
positive;This might sound easy, but is actually devilishly tricky in many places.
negative;- The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous.
positive;The trailers on TV portrayed the film as a comedy, and I bugged my parents until they took me.
positive;The outbreak, nevertheless, must have left an indelible mark, for several years later it was followed by two similarly-themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions: Elia Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets (1950)' and Earl McEvoy's lower-budget 'The Killer That Stalked New York (1950).
negative;The scenes of boring people dragged on an on, and whenever someone got killed, the film would slow down.
negative;And for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them.
positive;I have enjoyed both of the Van Dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again.<br /><br />Just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />Dick was good when he was younger but I enjoyed him more as he got older.<br /><br />Son Berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps.<br /><br />Together they make a great team and work well together.<br /><br />I am disappointed that I have not found another Murder 101 listed anywhere.<br /><br />I have seen both of the ones that have been shown.
negative;Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts.
negative;I think a sequel to Who's the Man?
negative;"<br /><br />Carlos Mencia likes to use the word ""beaners"" as much as Dave Chappelle liked using the ""n"" word."
positive;It's beautiful and sweet, engaging, and endearing.<br /><br />It rates a 7.3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
positive;This was so much better than i expected, the film oozed proffesionalism compared to other B-moive of this sort of budget.
negative;"There's even a line the tries to make the journey into the Earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in ""Armageddon"")."
positive;Someone said the story has something to do with the Sheakespearian tragedies.
positive;Then along comes a film like Noroi - The Curse.
positive;I can't believe I missed this one.
positive;My daughter and I quote them to each other often.
negative;Amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line.
positive;I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy.
positive;Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man.
negative;He should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film.
positive;When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then...
negative;"It has also become yet another movie that ""needs"" two sequels for it, so I am going to have to hear about this horrible franchise for quite a while longer.<br /><br />Now to the film and why it is so bad."
negative;OOH...a cold spot!
negative;It was annoying.. as someone else said.. yeah, right.. of course that would have happened...
negative;Enough said.
negative;As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation, it'd lose none of its power - indeed, for me, it would perhaps be more impressive.
positive;Las but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!
positive;During this time, she (as the British say) keeps a 'stiff upper lip' and makes the best of it--even though she really isn't a housewife but a famous professional writer.
positive;Without Tucsos stirring them up, the rest of those Indians will get reasonable, just as fast as they can.
positive;What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other.
negative;would get them started in the right direction.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****
negative;Anyhow I'd high expectations on this movie, and I've got disappointed.
positive;The part when they're all partying in an abandoned church, I can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church, that is still God's house.
negative;"Rarely has a performance screamed of ""look at me, I'm acting"" smugness."
positive;Tanya Roberts(Becky)and Robin Sherwood(Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future films,especially Jocelyn Jones!
positive;Excellent performance by Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson.
negative;"Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.<br /><br />The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap."
negative;Animation is good, but not quite good enough.
positive;The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Das.<br /><br />The movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible.
negative;I can't feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves.
negative;So he lives his new life in search of these markings, and to find them on these intimate places he does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, he has sex with them.
positive;Afaik, this one is not currently available on DVD, but AMC airs it occasionally, so keep a lookout, or you could always wishlist it on your TiVo!
positive;However, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me.
positive;Being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible.<br /><br />Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andre Toulon.
negative;Even the human story had some explanation to it.
positive;After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be awarded.
positive;Morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer.
positive;This movie series was part of that effort although anyone who had the chance to meet Oyama (I did) would never question his allegiance to Japan.
positive;I saw the Korean version of Daisy first.
positive;Needless to say, I loved it.
negative;It's bad enough that the American studios use Toronto as a stand in for New York.
positive;If anyone has a good VHS copy, I'd love to buy it.
positive;Indeed, one officer observes that rewriting orders is about a possible as rewriting the Bible.
positive;This is not a film that can be viewed like a Disney film or the movie of the week.
negative;They should reflect the culture.
negative;My friend and I were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she's been following her around.
negative;In the book she was 16.
negative;He manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous 'wild goose chase'.
positive;"That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of ""Water"" after having had the script cleared, shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face, cannot examine or discuss them."
negative;Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs.
negative;I would recommend both 'Waterloo Road' and 'The Street',to fans of good drama - the latter in particular which managed to achieve this.
positive;From the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is.
positive;I think this movie was very good and recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans.
positive;<br /><br />Robert Plant can be a bit much at times, and you can nearly sense Page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics, but that didn't matter I guess - especially for the era.
negative;From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clich√©s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.<br /><br />Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights.
negative;"""High Noon"" was also shot in Jamestown, as was ""Back to the Future III""."
negative;As for the creature, where do I start?
negative;I heard the budget was $600,000.
positive;At times I find myself believing that the USA could easily slip into fascism.
negative;What the hell happened to the guy?
positive;The situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual, of course, we're still talking about a movie, but the main characters are indeed plausible.
positive;This turn-of-the-century tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action.
positive;These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film.<br /><br />But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise.
positive;<br /><br />All in all, Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers, but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems, considering it was released half a century ago.
negative;What is nice to see is where it was made.
negative;To make a long story short, this movie is boring.
positive;"There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacon's ""42nd Street,"" which had been made about 20 years before, featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation, a fresh-faced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business, who saves the show when the star fails--""You're going out there a kid from the chorus, but you've got to come back a STAR!!"""
negative;ABC actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced.
positive;Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).<br /><br />The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.
negative;She was just there.
positive;I haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack(if there even is one).
negative;I can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made.
negative;It was so awful, I had to register just to say how bad it was.<br /><br />I watched this movie, and I wanted to break it every minute I watched.
positive;This film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn't run as long as it did.
positive;The Kiss.
positive;The real monsters in this flick are humans.
negative;My husband and I were happier and cared more about her character ending up with Josh's character than we were about the two main characters.
negative;Funny, I agreed to see it just for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before retiring, while I stayed in front of the TV, but only to feed the the masochistic in me and I because I wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects which might alleviate the feeling I had of being a stupid for watching this **** called Two Girls and a guy...<br /><br />Everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong... since the initial, absurd, premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend, until the awful, but merciful, end, not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors... Don't believe the rumors, the junkie's acting is bad and I don't see how Graham has made herself a known name within the movie industry...<br /><br />I wonder why, after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location, they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his ***...<br /><br />At least, I felt a little fine when I destroyed the DVD and threw it to the trash...
positive;Great editing by the Universal expert crew.
positive;They are hunted and starving.
negative;The reviews I've written thus far have been for films that I love, respect, and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings.
negative;To make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash.
negative;All the child actors in this movie, male and female, are talented and attractive.
positive;Through the course of the film, they experience a role reversal--one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams.
negative;The saving grace of COTB is that it surely fills suicide hot-lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (sadly) Carrot Top probably contributes to his sponsor AT&T's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated HBO viewers.
positive;CMI's soundtrack is, once again, a step up.
positive;Don't make this mistake.
positive;"the rating to 6.4.<br /><br />Per IMDb: ""IMDb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages."
negative;I NEVER bail out of a film early but this was painful to view.
positive;page is always so very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al excellent.
negative;"For two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...<br /><br />How many times has someone or other remarked that Eastenders ""mirrors life""?"
positive;In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast.
negative;Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the more original -- which is kind of amazing considering that it features extensive footage copped from three other cannibal movies -- and easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, though not much.<br /><br />I will let others outline the plot: What fascinated me about the film is how staged it all looks, and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this film has as some sort of all-out assault on good taste.
positive;It's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later.
negative;Unfortunately, April 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical newscasters that participate in it.
negative;Overall, a fat stinking 1/10.
positive;><br /><br />Neat treat with all the cameos too.
positive;Finally, if you're from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions to cab drivers!
negative;Recommended only for completists and Me Me Lai fans.
positive;If you are, this is one innovative RomCom.
negative;Hitler and his cohorts giggle with delight as they watch an American soldier get shot out of a window and fall into a fountain.
positive;"When you hear the title ""Meatballs"", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp."
positive;I've seen a lot of negative comments about it and I don't think the Viewers are being real about it!
negative;"Could it be the horrid ""trendy"" suck ass music?"
negative;p.s.
positive;"""Who do you dream of?"
positive;First the film is a homage to Jascha Heifetz, considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century.
positive;The ending is so much the better for being untidy.
negative;Sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there's no story.
positive;An opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million-dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men.
positive;Thanks.
positive;Because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.<br /><br />All in all, I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
negative;The story behind this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a kid with serious family problems,his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus's in a jar (NICE!)
positive;After walking awhile and breaking the heel of her shoe, she gets into Ridley's car when he drives by.
positive;He avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective.
positive;In fact, she's much better.<br /><br />Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their characters well, but they also worked perfectly together.
positive;"Three cheers for seeing a ""lesser President"" in a film as a major character!"
positive;"He says to Eddie ""Candle In The Eye, Candle In The Eye"", and Eddie been the simpleton that he is, sticks the candle he's carrying into his eye."
negative;It's a male bashing bonanza.
positive;I'd suggest that you don't watch anything again.
positive;The quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle, and this gave a fine balance together with the well-executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie.
positive;"There's even a chance that the normal status quo, long abandoned when Eastwood's machinations are uncovered, could return; but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road...<br /><br />This is a totally different style of film from the same Director's Dirty Harry, made in the same year, and yet they are both equally superb."
positive;"It was difficult to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Agent Hotchner of Criminal Minds.<br /><br />Perhaps not the best scene, but the one I enjoy most, my ""rewind scene,"" is the section where Candy is expecting a visitor, and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door."
positive;"It does seem that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types do appear everywhere; be it in one's family, church or bowling league.<br /><br />THESE are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us; unless, of course, whatever 'it' is does not fly in the face of today's ""acceptable"" language, mores and general ""standards"" of ""proper"" behavior.<br /><br />SO it is that these latter day, high tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what was Hollywood's greatest achievement; namely their participation in our own Allied Propaganda via their unselfishly crafted message and theme films.<br /><br />COLDLY brutal in its generation, the Banned Code and List of Now Unacceptable extends into the Wartime Cartoons that don't meet with the new touchy, feely socially engineered 'official' attitudes; which these ""Thought Police"" have foisted down upon us.<br /><br />WE were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects."
positive;The way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative.
positive;Seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft, to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in May 1927, 'Luck Lindy' as he was christened, endured enormous risks, which are featured in this superb film.
positive;And, over time, she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor.
positive;I always thought the Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman.
positive;It took some time for me to warm up to her- possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist so well.
positive;"Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in ""And One Was Beautiful,"" a 1940 film also starring Billie Burke."
negative;Montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach.
positive;"He was doing drama; everyone else was doing romantic comedy."
negative;Very good music played at the right time.
positive;It was an all around good movie.
positive;So, let me watch the film first.
negative;But the script is lame, really lame.
positive;The film shows little of Knox in the school but instead centers on Dunne as she lives in nearby spartan housing for spouses.
positive;How many ways can different sea creatures swim, kill, poo, mate, and lay eggs, and do all of these ways really need to be explored?
negative;You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.<br /><br />I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find.
positive;All this and much more in one simple movie?
negative;Personally, I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack.
positive;It is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction.<br /><br />That is to say, as much as I loved this film, it wasn't perfect.
positive;She is a great fan of this movie as I am.
positive;He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the audience.
positive;"The life of one of Japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor set design somewhere between traditional Noh Theater and ""the Wizard Of Oz""."
negative;This episode stood out so far as by far the worst.
positive;Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sympathy for the villain in the end.
positive;Or flee Venice to save his own life?
positive;it disappeared for some time then i saw it again a couple of months ago (i'm 19).
negative;!<br /><br />3 out of 10
negative;it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'Nam.
negative;Anathema.<br /><br />I have hated certain films before, but I've never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its thresh-hold and became SELF loathing!
positive;Since 9/11, 'extraordinary rendition' allowed the government's intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal plays rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (note the irony) who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the US.
positive;Arthur Hohl is one mean man and Marjorie Main is very clearly a much battered wife.<br /><br />The kids in the cast do well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl under the name of Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, nightclub partner to Nelson Eddy.
positive;"But with ""Fame,"" at least I can remember what it was like."
negative;This one is lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.)
negative;In fact, the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common HO scale model in front of a painted background!
positive;Most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms.
negative;"So when the critics unleashed their fury against ""The Cat in the Hat"", another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role, I thought that it must be the same old song."
positive;One does what he likes, the other as he's told.<br /><br />From the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building, and see how they rub off a little on each other.
negative;stinker...barf city.
negative;The dialouge was embarrassing at times.
negative;"Reba is , without a doubt , one of the worst ""comedy"" series ever."
negative;"Far better than ""Supernova"" which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it."
positive;it really had good authenticity.
positive;John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupin.
positive;"This is kind of a precursor to ""The Time Tunnel"" where time travelers on a weekly basis were given the same task, overcoming what had already happened."
negative;I'm baffled at all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) appearing in this bore-fest alongside Lauren Graham, the woman from Gilmore Girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag.
negative;But no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the Japanese.
positive;Dude, I thought this movie rocked.
negative;And what can we say about those helicopters made in Paint Brush...?
positive;He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress.
positive;The only guy who seems decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so naturally Hope Lange neglects him for a ne'er do well ex-boyfriend.

positive;What's Broadway without the acting?
negative;As another poster commented, several of the reels were out of order, and while it was disorienting at first, and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - what was just awful became surreal and amusing.
positive;If there is a more deeply spiritual, flowing homage to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures, it has yet to be filmed.
positive;As events unfold, you come to realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man burdened by a terrible secret.<br /><br />By revealing bits and pieces of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, the writers, directors and cast gradually lead you towards a greater understanding of and sympathy for him.
positive;And the delivery of the jokes are rapid-fire a lot of the time in the better episodes.
negative;Unless the movie is intentionally a bad B-rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness, no movie should ever ever ever have a main character irritate you if one expects the audience to care about the character.

positive;Sergio Martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial-minded and creative at the same time.
positive;No wonder it has barely been released outside of Japan, let alone had an American remake lined up yet.

positive;For those U.S. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey.
negative;The fighting scenes could have been better, but either they weren't able to afford it, or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas.This is a cheap low type of action cinema.
negative;I think the IMDb rating for this film speaks for itself.
negative;The only redeeming thing I can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception.
positive;Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece.
negative;Suspension of disbelief ceased, and I started thinking the fun I'd have torturing this film...
positive;He misses his streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light, and in the end the stranger gets his own.

negative;"This is my first ""awful"" rating ever on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with."
positive;Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie.
negative;The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so terrible it's almost funny, especially the part where Patrick Swayze's knight character goes home to his Knight father who has retired after losing his legs and is now bed-ridden in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know he was a knight.
negative;"I would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie, mostly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself.<br /><br />Helmed by director Jim Gillespie, (""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven't ever seen a teen slasher movie before."
negative;Unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.<br /><br />If there are any redeemable features at all, Kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.
positive;Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.<br /><br />This movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it.
negative;The main problem is the acting.
positive;Music videos are often completely disregarded in any discussion about film, with most people considering them to be a lesser art form.

negative;In the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma.
negative;So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever those are) are wasted because HIS CHARACTER IS WORTHLESS.
positive;<br /><br />I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical Chaplin slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber.
negative;Could it be mom's boyfriend, a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex-student led to his wife's suicide?
negative;This movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes Errol Flynn's memory.
positive;I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant.
positive;Watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets, you see him happy, delivering his big paternal speech, giving orders, and loving the control...until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet?
positive;The story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining.
positive;This is a great horror-spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances.
positive;This is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war.
negative;There's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh?
negative;Normally, I wouldn't even stoop to viewing trash like this, but since role-playing is a dear hobby to me, and such was the subject of the film, I did.
negative;Joel Benjamin, a chess grandmaster on IBM's programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do.
negative;Tough, cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent.
negative;And I'll keep on trying to find a movie that DOESN'T have SOMEONE who raves about it.
positive;Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - indolent, uppity and ultimately in need.
negative;Don't believe the hype!!!
positive;I think the actor played a better part in pride and prejudice so i don't think he acted in his highest level but yeah back to the girl i mean shes gorgeous perfect and i could only wish her luck in her future movies yeah also her acting skills in such young age was awesome i was just amazed Wit her performance.

negative;"And if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out Lorraine Warren by the second episode.<br /><br />""Paranormal State"" is weak sauce."
positive;EVERYONE when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to today's attire and how funny we would find today's male population if they wore tights day in day out!
negative;With decent direction, editing, and musical score, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of Blake Edward's '10', instead of a weepy version of Ron Howard's 'Splash'.
negative;<br /><br />The quality of the filming is beyond low budget.
positive;Like The Bolsheviks vs The Hart Foundation was only about 40 seconds long, Koko B Ware vs Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs Akeem was too short.<br /><br />Mr Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake 'the snake' Roberts were very good indeed.<br /><br />Overall Grade - B

positive;I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper.
positive;The flashbacks introduce a few fresh characters, and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising way.<br /><br />The fresh characters dominate the whole episode and I can't say it does any harm.

negative;It was funny, charming, and had heart... this piece of junk has NONE of those things.<br /><br />Reused jokes from the original film, stupid plots, bad animation, different voices (with the exception of Kronk and Yzma) that sound NOTHING like the ones in the original (especially Pacha... *shudder*).<br /><br />The characters are off model, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around.<br /><br />And why is Kuzco a jerk again?

positive;It's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble.
positive;Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed.
positive;Not since my first viewing of Ringu ten years ago have I been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film.
positive;This heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes,each and every time as well as makes me homesick.I often wonder if I should have been born in that era as I think I would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.<br /><br />In short I consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a 'sensitive or caring type'.Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900's and what a wonderful story it is.More kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.If we had more films of this nature ,the world would become a better place.

negative;"An hour and ten minutes into the film and you feel like he has almost had a piece of every woman in Melbourne.<br /><br />The film is a giant chunk of pretentious celluloid; it is like grandiloquence drips from every frame."
positive;Director Stacy Peralta, who's one of the legendary Z-Boys himself, relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining: the snappy rapid-fire editing, ceaseless speedy pace, and raw, gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz, projecting a sense of sheer joy and full-on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold.
negative;And are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes?
positive;"This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, he conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's ""Go"")."

positive;Now, in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt, the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss Slaughter.
positive;We are looking at victims and not titillation.<br /><br />The gifted cast rings true.
negative;Should you watch this movie?
positive;By the end of the journey, Herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon.

positive;Thanks to their swift response, the virus was contained with minimal casualties.
negative;In fact I felt so incensed at this shows excremental existence, I felt compelled to comment.
negative;I gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful.
positive;There are no surprises, but everybody does their thing well.<br /><br />Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window.

negative;I'll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is.
negative;So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased.

positive;It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film.

negative;I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat.
negative;I understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read Heart of Darkness, and they create their own movie in their head, but they director cuts important scenes and adds pointless ones.

negative;It could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows.
positive;And of course, he didn't have to act about being a lover of women.<br /><br />What is different here, of course, is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner, interspersed, of course, with some of his traditional slap-stick moves.

negative;Maybe that's the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to do movies in 80's fashion like it will come back in style.
positive;Set in Bengal in the early 1900's, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women.

negative;"They will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in, and loath over the fast changing script, and protest against the boring performances, and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al ""Air Bud,"" as I did.<br /><br />I suppose that they will think the dog is adorable."

negative;This is the worst parody movie ever.
negative;Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion.

positive;This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces.
negative;I think that this was one of the most trite films ever made.
positive;The film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see, if just not for a change of pace.
positive;Its all over.
negative;What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine does best is to delve into Garry Kasparov's psyche during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue.

negative;First things first - though I believe Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here) downright bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to John Grisham whose novel this is based on.<br /><br />Set at an undetermined point in time (the 50s?
positive;The three men ask for refugee in an old Mansion which happens to be property of one of Ames' old acquaintances.

positive;It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect.
positive;This humor is not for everyone.
positive;The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again...from the view of a 16 year old, at least.

negative;Before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad.
positive;hey folks - SHOCK - it's an X-File.<br /><br />To me - it's cool that Scully/Mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills.
negative;Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero du jour, Ben Kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the know-it-all woman creator, and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an evil one - all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop.

negative;Sure, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to watch, but you won't miss anything by missing this one.
positive;Then we built a fort¬óFort Invincible.

positive;Surprisingly, it's neither.
negative;"If you have concerns about quality and budget - ""Open water"" was made on $60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks."
negative;This same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series, and the same tired and boring love-triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes!
negative;In spite of Rudy Ray Moore's very brief cameo, this movie is a work of supreme self-indulgence on Ron Hall's part - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor, and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills - but the movie is so unbelievably inept that it's hard to believe he'd actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like I'm doing right now.
positive;I mean, please, why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes?
positive;Let's just hope there won't be a godawful American remake of this unique romance/mystery-thriller.

positive;"The only movie I've seen that comes close, is ""Indian Summer"", which I like almost as much as ""Meatballs"", and also stars Matt Craven."
negative;"His screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners.The whole dialog in the film is a disaster, same as the plot.The title ""The Shepherd"" makes no sense."
negative;Excruciatingly slow-moving, boring and stupid.
positive;It really would have made more sense that way.<br /><br />The songs, while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed, are not particularly memorable.
negative;"Perhaps it was the large-print blurb from Ain't It Cool News on the ads that caused me to approach the film with some trepidation (it seems that Harry Knowles and his minions will approve of any film for VIP passes and free food), but ""Hatchet"" makes me question what writer-director Adam Green's idea of ""old school American horror"" really is: based on the evidence here, it means the insipid, late-'80s rip-offs of ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Deliverance."""

positive;These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees.
negative;"I'm going to turn emo now."""
negative;"The plot of ""Open Graves"" is very simple:it's about a board game called Mamba,where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game.Laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes.The characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense.I liked Eliza Dushku in ""Wrong Turn"",but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here.The climax with CGI-witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid.The only reason to see ""Open Graves"" are some interesting camera angles plus sexy Eliza Dushku.If such movies are the future of horror then I seriously give up.Give me any 70's or 80's low-budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap.A generous 3 out of 10."
positive;Mr. Drury's acting is top notch as it always is and he blends well with the other actors in the movie.
positive;A refreshing trip into the past, when the bad guys were ex-Nazis or Soviet brutes, cars were shiny, and France had colonies!
positive;His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see.
negative;Unlike Chuck Jones's Road Runner series, which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting, Freleng's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place.
positive;"As weird as that may sound I see this as ""Monsters Inc"" for horror film fans.<br /><br />Sure, the effects are of a std horror film, the monsters are there as in any monster based film, the gore is there as well, there even is a slasher in the shape of Dr Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see flash of Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way round?)."
negative;Call this movie by another title, but don't call it Caddyshack 2.
negative;Or Super Adventure Club.
negative;That's really about it.
positive;Good Job Boys.
positive;"There is nothing funnier than a robot...doing the robot.<br /><br />As for Bruce's performance: ""I take the 5th."""
positive;and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece.<br /><br />Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a tad, this can be a very engaging film.<br /><br />First, a note about the artistic quality of the movie.
negative;Oops, I just spoiled the drama.<br /><br />Another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on.
positive;From her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking.
positive;Anyone who's found of genuinely good comedy ought to go and get this series.
negative;I don't know, and I don't particularly care.
negative;I never rent or bought a Disney-sequel of what movie however.
positive;A problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.<br /><br />The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer.
positive;James Drury has the right touch when picking out a movie to be involved with.
positive;(EDIT: Guess what!
negative;However, this movie takes that to the extreme.
positive;This movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste, though.
negative;She just lets them all go, without saying a word!!
negative;If you are a movie director, and you actually think it's OK for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words SLUG before the title appears, left over from your rough edit - and you apparently can't muster the energy to edit those frames out - then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting.
positive;You might need to watch it again to get all the connections right.
positive;I am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II.
positive;For what I consider the best experience, I'd say watch the Korean version first.
positive;He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives, which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud.
positive;"Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded ""Rybak"") and Boris Plotnikov (as the physically wounded 'Sotnikov"") successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism."
positive;Her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ...as if she's really heart-broken at this tragedy!
positive;The supporting cast is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell.
positive;Definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike.
negative;Unfortunately, that doesn't leave much movie not to suck.
negative;It is not an updating of the story.
positive;Just when you THINK you know what is going to happen next, this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction.
positive;Director Larisa Shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well, despite its being a largely introspective piece of work.
positive;When he finds out that Irmgard cheats him, he chooses to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann by having a trip into the light of madness, but he drinks himself to death in front of Imrgard, their little daughter and his boozing buddies.
negative;<br /><br />I admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit.
positive;And this game has the best joke of the whole series.
positive;Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included.
negative;But, hey, it's a M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion in it... pathetic.<br /><br />Asterix is underemployed and Obelix talks too much.
negative;His make up effects aren't scary at all - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand, is all.
negative;"Musical numbers for what I think was the ""big"" fundraiser show(""you're in show business, I'm in show business, most of the kids are in show business, let's put on a show"")come out of nowhere BEFORE all the talk about putting on a show, and then fade without applause to totally unrelated ""straight"" scenes."
positive;It's complete and utter parody, every second a play for a laugh.
negative;"<br /><br />Then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard- the ""why in the world would he/they do that?"""
positive;"I enjoyed the film very much, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as the concubine.<br /><br />It was a little distracting, however, to have Chinese dialogue PLUS English subtitles PLUS American-accented voice-over, even though the voice over was very well synchronised.<br /><br />Qin shi huiang di's (The First Emperor of Qin's)family name was Zheng, and his given name Yiong so in the English he should have been referred to as ""King Zheng"" or ""Emperor Zheng"", and NOT as ""King Ying Zheng"" as in those days the two family/given names were not used together.<br /><br />The State of Qin is pronounced ""Chin"" not ""shin"" - a pity the researchers didn't get this right.<br /><br />I forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at ""Zai-an"" together with his terra cotta warriors."
negative;I wish that the MST3K crew were still in business.
negative;'s are always a nice way to kill some time, so on a rainy Sunday evening I picked up this flick, expecting what can be expected from a direct-to-DVD U.F.O.
negative;In keeping with the musical theme, Masters could then be played by Andrei Bocelli, that Peters Can sing with as he lands the plane.
negative;What a terrible series!
positive;"For Joe projects his own violent tendencies onto those who he considers ""the enemy"" and therefore considers himself to be in a war, and in this movie, the ""generation gap"" is portrayed as a war."
negative;The fact that it was based on a Harlan Cohen book is telling, because rather than being a French film (strong on psychology and character), it's more like a John Grisham-esquire roller-coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists, flashbacks that update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!')
negative;The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show.
negative;to begin with, i don't like this kind of films, i feel like somebody is trying to pull my leg.<br /><br />furthermore, after seeing this film one doesn't know what happened, is such a confusing film.
negative;Grady Harp
negative;But hey, it wasn't the worst film of the year by far.
negative;Probably better than I could do.<br /><br />Not being a fan of football, at least I found out that Jim Brown is a real person and not somebody Richard Pryor made up.
positive;Brilliant... Quite brilliant.
positive;Recently, an opera has been introduced here in Los Angeles, based on the movie The Fly.
positive;A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene.
positive;The film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.<br /><br />What is refreshing about Noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences.
positive;She wrote it mainly for herself, even though she did make some rigorous rewrites before the occupants of the Secret Annexe were betrayed, intending it to be published someday.<br /><br />But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope...but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a diary.
positive;I laughed very hard on some parts.
negative;Yes - it almost looks like it's done professionally.
negative;No thanks.
negative;Bijou Phillips was hailed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully, and Agnes Bruckner has been an up-and-coming talent for a while now.<br /><br />So, what about the gore?
negative;Sadly, good acting, a little humor and suspense is where the good points end.
negative;"When Mr. Peil sees Mr. Hayakawa's paintings, he sees a painter worthy to become his ""son and disciple."""
negative;You don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb.
positive;As a result, the movie characters around Mr. Bean respond differently to his behaviour than their TV series counterparts.
negative;I love John's work as a singer, but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view.
positive;Mas Oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century.
positive;The movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours.
positive;"Torture, for sure, may be employed, especially if the rendition is out of our hands - although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter - but intel that can save lives is vital in this ""shadow war."""
positive;he is the best comedian i have seen in my life.
positive;I watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud.
positive;And a very cool one, I may say.
negative;Maybe all this proves is that Hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore Bigfoot films, as they have yet to make one that works.
positive;Christian Duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career.
positive;He is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching Jatin about how the police force functions.
negative;It is OK movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends.
positive;"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features."
negative;One of the worst movies I saw in the 90s.
positive;They were on the move all the time, and it was a very difficult shoot.
negative;The thing is, this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum I mentioned that I can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole.<br /><br />It's preachy.
negative;2) Scenes dragged on way longer than they needed to.
positive;Finally, it is left to one doctor in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease.
negative;Too bad none of the jokes are funny.
positive;Better still, this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanticizes its subjects: These rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives.
negative;Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!
positive;Another things I'd change is to see them actually act on the show.
negative;Let's start with the gratuitous sex although I admit the rotational style of bonking was something I had not seen (nor experienced) before.
negative;Being a big fan of Steve James also, I can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend Billy Drago, as well as seeing Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role.
negative;"You would think that by ""stealing"" themes and images from a funnier film, your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two."
positive;Rent this series at once!
negative;Oh yes -- Town Mouse and Country Mouse.
negative;Yeah... with no transition in between.
negative;Congrats.<br /><br />-AP3-
positive;When Slaughter catches up to him, MacMahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears--and this is too much of a clich√© and inconsistent.
negative;Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style.
negative;Also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i've ever seen.
positive;Nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it¬¥s teeth-gnashing early on.
negative;I'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons because I really find it hard to believe that anyone with any taste actually LIKES this.
negative;"I watched ""Fuckland"" a long time ago."
negative;AND on top of THAT, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song).
negative;Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less awful than Austen's portrayal.
negative;Almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give Ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas, but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs.
negative;So basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it.
positive;In both movies, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his normal British surroundings into America (the first movie) and France (the second movie).
negative;This is groundbreaking territory.
positive;Unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and the future always negate the result.
negative;It tries to be hip, and appeal to the young MTV-generation audience, but it is just downright laughable.
negative;Can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV watching No theater dance thing that she did?
positive;The movie begins with Dahmer, played quite convincingly by Carl Crew, sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment.
negative;BRAVO!<br /><br />It seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the Middle East (hey an overly emotional friendship story will work!)
positive;The oh so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated.
negative;<br /><br />Small children are harassed, things loom in the dark, voices encourage the living to kill, and the Aleister Crowely in me rubs my hands.
positive;Thank god that Christopher Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.
positive;I first saw this as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born) and fairly recently bought this on DVD.
negative;The only reason I went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot.<br /><br />I'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat.
positive;It's a good cheer-me-up selection.
positive;In contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a soda.<br /><br />But Harry has a second cache of coins, and dresses up for the date - and goes out.
positive;Se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke.<br /><br />- Tisha Campbell: Her's paranoid and sentimental Jay is just wonderful to see.<br /><br />- George O. Gore II: perfect for the paper.
positive;It definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic, unique NYC of the 80s that we have lost thanks to Giuliani.
negative;Its soon determined that everybody on Earth just might be doomed.
positive;Maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it.
positive;If you watched this film for the nudity (as I did) you won't be disappointed.
negative;It is horribly written and acted, and the big fight at the end if downright comical.
negative;The experienced General is just pushed aside like a complete moron who has to lick her boots because of her obviously superior capacity.
positive;He's aiming at your average Joe.
negative;But in fact, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen.
negative;That is what this film wanted to be.
positive;The vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape is unbroken, ripe for allegories of the mind.
negative;There are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release comes to town.
positive;The locations in the English countryside, the marvelous London locations, the interiors, smart wardrobes and of course, the writing and dialog made SEPARATE LIES a thrilling adventure.<br /><br />With that said, and perhaps this is just an American viewpoint, as the British are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual escapades, I found it hard to watch Tom Wilkinson just stand by, as his wife goes merrily on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy, creates much despair for her husband, with the cad that is Rupert Everett.
positive;The supporting cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also does quite well.
positive;I was very glad to find that it's about the best Brazilian movie I've ever seen.
positive;The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary.
positive;"Sure, most people will designate ""Island of the Fishmen"" as silly and trashy hokum, but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward THIS many exhilarating themes?"
positive;"it is wrong to compare this film with ""Love Letter"" by Shunji Iwai, japaness are very good but could never make one like Palwol ui Christmas."
negative;"Unlike the silly stumps in ""Navy VS The Night Monsters"", the Tabonga is actually a full-grown man-tree."
positive;"When the scientist's beautiful nurse-assistant is revealed to be a hunchback early in the film, the viewer is thereby alerted to the fact this film is not going to be typical Universal fare; this film foreshadows the kind of sleazy exploitation we would come to take for granted in 1950's sci-fi.<br /><br />If you don't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black & white does not throw you off, this film is recommended viewing."
negative;"possible, but I don't think so.... Tarkwosky for example also used very long shots, but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and I mean just their heads, because in this movie there are a lot of those shots, but sometimes it IS effective), the general result is plainly boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that, while intelligent, is above all very pedantic)<br /><br />you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic, or symbolic effect, but just to spare on budget....<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in this film, because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just went on and on, without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....<br /><br />While reading the very praising comments on this page, I also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty, it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is quite interesting on itself, but it does NOT make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself....an exercise that, in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching ""Stalker"" or ""Solyaris"" than Werckmeister Harmonies, that owes much to Tarkowsky, but cab never equal it's level...."
negative;Her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range.
negative;The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.
negative;What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said.
negative;Without that, the film implodes.
positive;I am both impressed and saddened that something this relevant (and yes, accurate) was filmed more than 30 years ago.
negative;The first space capsule into outer space crash lands back on Earth(with some of the worst special effects ever), and the pilot appears to be dead.
negative;Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play,if you cannot say something nice...<br /><br />De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink.She has an affair with Banderas ,whom we suspect of being (ouch!how original!)
positive;Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance as Marcy suffering from Tourette's Sydrome, getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses.
negative;That's really sad, because I have no idea of what else to say about this movie, which actually says a a lot about it, don't you think?
negative;That was a huge mistake.
positive;The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.<br /><br />The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors.
negative;What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with a bad toupee, and an alien all on a train?
negative;But even the talented Carrell can't save this.
negative;After this, we see the first, and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not.
positive;"Leonard Cohen grabs the most screen time, two of his beautifully melancholic songs ""So Long Marianne"" and ""Suzanne."""
positive;"This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed ""victim"" messing the whole set until she finally ""die""."
positive;The Director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience.
negative;As it is, it is just a tragedy, both to behold and to be a part of.
positive;She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch.
negative;Man was I wrong.<br /><br />First, the writing apparently came from an eight-grader who barely knew anything about Ed's history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes.
negative;One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to get paid.<br /><br />I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by, but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture.
negative;But that's about it.
positive;He'll put Nordestina in the map, as he says.
positive;!<br /><br />Some of the scenes between Gary and Karin are hard to watch(particularly the final scene of coarse).
negative;"The movie goes something like this: Run around, run around, someone killed, lots of freaking out and then one of the group yells to ""Pull it together"" or ""Just calm down!"""
negative;Must have ran out of budget.<br /><br />This is a really amateur job.
negative;He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters.
positive;If so, then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film.<br /><br />The ending seems somewhat abrupt.
positive;I guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her.
positive;While it was very good, it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short-lived.
positive;'Buddy Faro' never had a chance.
negative;"Okay, i know, Walt himself and the famous ""nine old man"" can't come back."
positive;They are obviously wrong for each other, this much is clear.
positive;It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
negative;Tim Curry was the reason I wanted to see this film, and while of course his appearance is always entertaining, he's basically wasted in it.
negative;It's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie.
negative;There are many Christmas movies to watch.
positive;Kathy Bates in particular is amazing as Leno's manager.<br /><br />Funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.
negative;She and Karmen dance together.
negative;I'm not just saying that because I'm used to better movies.
positive;This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level.
positive;Knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e.
positive;'The Big Snit' came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul.
negative;What a waste of time.
positive;After seeing the movie, I was blown away.
negative;I'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines.<br /><br />Oh and then there's a nice touch at the very end.
positive;Also the writer, Eric Chappell, wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of TV episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film.
positive;<br /><br />The movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today's modern India and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family.
positive;And though the cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun.
negative;The wonderful special effects .3. the Academy Award winning acting and .4.
negative;The romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few.
positive;"She's a hell of an actress, but in ""incautos"" she looks a little bit forced)."
positive;The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun, the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm.
positive;Positive portrayals of Latinos, with no drugs, sex or street violence.
positive;It's hard to put my finger on it.
negative;Of course, this is all made much more watchable by viewing it on MST.
negative;Right after that at the bus stop, well you need to see it as it's pretty messed up.<br /><br />All in all this movie is a total bomb, I gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above.
negative;I might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non-violent as they claim, but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing.
positive;"I scoop!""."
positive;Striking cinematography and good narrative (via flashback) take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer.
negative;Argh!
positive;He was called on to repeat this feat numerous times.
positive;It won't spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think you'll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with.
negative;Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids.
negative;Matte paintings here and there might have helped.)
negative;Unfortunately, I still don't like it.
negative;Unfortunately, this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels.
positive;"""Coffers"" isn't a word you hear around much these days, unless you read folk tales to your children, as I do."
negative;It's one of those so-bad -it's- good movies but I wish that someone would find a half decent print.
positive;The technicolor is excellent.
negative;The characters are not much better than a story.
positive;This is definitely added to my list of Ghetto Movies.<br /><br />Juice - Starring Tupac 'I don't giva F***' Menace II Society - O-Dawg 'I'll smoke Anybody, I just don't giva F****' New Jersey Drive - Hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't giva f***<br /><br />New Jersey Drive is the best hood movie ever.
positive;Drum changes the orders and Holloway is given the mission at the last minute, and everybody is shocked.
negative;Also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible.
positive;Who needs special effects?
positive;And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact, yada, yada.
positive;Supposedly Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film.
negative;While it's easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a clich√©.
positive;When Irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce, Hans suffers a heart attack.
positive;"""It's not Goulash, It's Irish Stew""."
positive;A very well drawn, perfectly animated world, that is.<br /><br />I can't tell much of the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's a high school comedy... and yet it's not.
negative;Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison(Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion.
negative;It tries to be a number of genres and fails at each.
positive;"""Rendition"" may not be perfect, but it IS good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live."
positive;Given that 95% of the people there were as a matter of fact male, they just kinda let their mouths run wild, and there was language in it.
positive;And the way he does it is unbelievable.
positive;The most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd, polka-like song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter.
negative;There really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours.
negative;But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.
positive;The cameo in the movie is by Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding).
negative;"Sheriff John Agar (as Clint Crawford) isn't trusted by the younger set; but, he really wants to help.<br /><br />Mr."

negative;), Nippy the dog after eating CHOW DOWN, and numerous others.
negative;Could it be the moody son, who's impressed by his dad's no-nonsense attitude about women?
positive;The story felt realistic - it isn't mushy, but made me feel what they were going through.
negative;"As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunion of the cast of ""Xica da Silva"" on one stage, don't.)"
positive;I don't understand all these bad reviews.
positive;I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing.
negative;They shoplift, they steal, they might show their breasts, (not in this case,) or they might possibly be alcoholics.
negative;"The movie was a real ""gotcha"" for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation."
negative;The plot centers around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who alerts the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day, a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an embattled Deputy Prime Minister (David Suchet) who tries to look important.<br /><br />But it's all so unreal that one feels like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes.
negative;<br /><br />I plan not to recommend this to my family and friends, as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it.
positive;However, Donald Kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious Terry Shaw, and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time.<br /><br />As usual with Frank R. Strayer films, the low budget hurts the film badly, as while Strayer makes the best he can, the film still feels kind of plain at times.
negative;I don't know why they even kept the name.
negative;"It is ""classic"" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality."
negative;Not anymore you won't.<br /><br />By the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters.
positive;Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes.
positive;I'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well.
negative;<br /><br />If you are fans of either of the ladies or either Baldwin then you may find something to like here, but others should steer clear.
negative;This movie is not worth your time, save your money, or throw it in the garbage, just don't waste it on this movie.
negative;Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the Enterprise to ANYONE?
negative;I can visualize the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of last-minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of COTB's orange-haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.
positive;Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code.
positive;Everything about it.
positive;"I'm sad that Sony has not seen fit to release this on DVD (""but one day, one day..."")."
positive;****
negative;Ron Hall's range of emotions are always off.
positive;It made me laugh!
negative;The cast list was pitiful, and the all around plot was pathetic and was not like the book, except for a few scenes.
negative;The cookie-cutter gets to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story.
positive;But they just go so well together!
positive;Predictably, Harmony is aghast at this prospect.
negative;If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this isn't it!
negative;There's something intriguing about disaster movies.
negative;"If you're a kid liking fairy tale ""real life"" adventures, see it."
positive;You'll might also enjoy a couple of Pakistani sitcoms such as ups and downs and aik aur aik which are certainly comparable to India's best.
negative;I hope zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of pap that I wont get back.<br /><br />And falsifying ratings just makes it a million times worse.<br /><br />One reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years?
negative;Man, I went to this movie because of the great preview.
positive;Live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh.
positive;While I don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge.
positive;One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to.
negative;"It simply drops a weak batch of ""characters"" into a location and then things occasionally happen."
positive;(Although, as movies go, I loved Dogma!
negative;By celebrating the butcher of the Nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level.
positive;We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end.
positive;It was then moved to Fridays at 7 P.M. because I.T.V.
positive;They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service!
positive;Though often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power.
negative;Does Lindsey Lohan perhaps listen to opera?
positive;Still, despite this minor quibble, it's an engaging film that is NOT for the kids due to all the violence and boobs.
positive;The two movies do little justice to the TV series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes.
negative;Still, maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride.<br /><br />Phantom Rancher isn't as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films I've seen, but it still isn't much.
negative;Fred gazes at Rita with a brotherly smile, but she's so mannequin-like (lip-synching to her songs like a wide-eyed wind-up doll) that all romantic sparks quickly sputter.
positive;Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery.
negative;You'll hate it!
negative;A hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house.
negative;The mentality and deliverance is the same, yet somehow feels evil and soulless.
negative;Last I heard this wasn't part of werewolf lore at all!
negative;Probably a little of both.....Probably a LOT of both!
negative;"Not every movie released during this bountiful season of the Slasher Era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th,"" but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema."
negative;<br /><br />Detailed comments would just be a laundry list of failure.
negative;A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all.
negative;If this ever happens to you in real life, don't do it!<br /><br />She's transported to some weird wannabe Jean Rollin netherworld that's supposed to be sexy but isn't, where there's this thing that looks like a rotted creature from the black lagoon!<br /><br />Soon she turns all her artsy sleazeball friends onto her new form of supernatural crack.
positive;Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things.
positive;It's simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs.
positive;If we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors, we should be prepared for a wild ride, this film seems to suggest.
positive;I've had the honor and pleasure to meet Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and have a nice chat with him, and I've had the chance to meet Buck Taylor who performs the role of town doctor.
negative;Julia Roberts does a bang-up job in her role, but basically women are really demeaned in this movie, and it was really annoying.
positive;What a crazy film!It lasts 12(!)
negative;<br /><br />If you love his music, then the video has a little music from him in it, but not much.
negative;A little research, all I'm asking.
negative;Maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, I don't know.<br /><br />On Mark Lester: A performance more wooden than a carpenter's workshop.
negative;I watched the movie on the weekend of 7th AUG and I thought is was absolute nonsense (and I am using that word extremely litely).
positive;Replacing George Howe from the play in the role of Headmaster Pond, is Alastair Sim, and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation, Sim & Rutherford are perfectly wonderful, bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie, highly entertaining.
negative;"Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are done with computer animation, which works for things such as dinosaurs, ghosts, and space ships."
positive;As it is, it's tremendously sad.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blindsided by the woman he adores, and Emily Watson does a beautiful job as Ann, who, once she frees herself from her lies - her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage - knows what she has to do.
positive;It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was, always attempting to push the envelope, and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper, more poignant motive on his mind.
negative;The worst movie i've seen in years (and i've seen a lot of movies).
positive;The ship fighting sub-game is badly innappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games.
negative;The next time I go to the store, I fear that I will see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothing, etc.
positive;While the film isn't a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director, precious little of which is available on video here in the U. S.
positive;"Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man."
positive;"Bruno could seem to represent the ""Id"", as Freud would put it, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind."
positive;Please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b&w version.
negative;"Oh, yeah, there is a good chunk of nudity when Alex ""rescues"" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a laughable bit of hypocrisy)."
negative;Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained.
negative;I prefer the original Pulp Fiction by the great Quentin Tarantino.
negative;But he can't tell us, the audience, or his team of gothed out undergrads, because...
positive;A whiff of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing tight-fitting cheongsams of Lizhen reflects the constraints of decision-making, the ruins of Angkor Wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads.<br /><br />The excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship.
positive;Now i watch the DVDs, i love this.
positive;This is tale of beautiful futility.
positive;3.
negative;"When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word ""predictable"" repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a dented LP or those commercials you really hate."
positive;)!
negative;Believe me when I say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film.
positive;IT's a great movie for anyone, say, 11 and up who isn't a romantic-comedy freak.
negative;"""King of the road"" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt."
positive;<br /><br />The movie itself runs at an uneven pace.
negative;Especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different.<br /><br />Now let's assume you're a Christian fundamentalist yourself and you're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie, is this a good movie?
negative;By far, Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious.
negative;"A ""C"" rated flick at best."
negative;"At the beginning, when we're first meeting the characters, a man might introduce his female companion abruptly, avoiding any tedious subtlety: ""Professor, this is my fianc√©e and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman."
positive;As far as I can tell, both versions end a LOT different, and were intended that way.<br /><br />I'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film, and will find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring.
negative;First of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (Not ER or EMT, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously.
negative;I would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available.
negative;The script by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason & is one clich√© after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator (1987).
positive;Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track.
positive;She gets an old lover to help.
negative;The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the Enterprise!!!!!!!
positive;Some scenes (such as Knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch.
negative;Thus, it always seems that Nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film.<br /><br />Another actor might have done a great job with the role, delivered his lines believably, and made it an outstanding movie.
negative;I won't even bother checking the name of the leading man - hopefully he's back doing commercials.<br /><br />Even poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I adore and respect, seemed to be channeling Katherine Hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home.
negative;If you like William Smith, he plays a bit of a git (as he has always been wont to do).<br /><br />And that's about it.
positive;"""The Beguiled"" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, and a departure from his typical early roles."
negative;"in response ""I kill zombies"" and ""I was never a disk jockey, I was a soldier."""
negative;There was a reasonably good cast, headed by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, playing Grocer, his arch-rival in the hit-man business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blank's high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night, and a limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist.
negative;But a film this bad that wasted talent so good (Caine, Gelbart, and Donen) is a reason for mourning not a pleasant diversion.
negative;Thankfully this train wreck is over!
negative;Now to the point.
negative;"2) The best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname ""the brick""."
negative;"Black FBI Agent: ""Excellent, that's what I would do!"""
positive;I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago.
negative;Yeah right.
positive;Eva Gabor lends her silky sweet voice to Dutchess.<br /><br />Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed, or worked on, every Disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985.<br /><br />This is among my very favorite of the Disney animated feature films, and belongs in any Disney collection.
positive;Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, though- most notably the assassin (played by Reggie Nalder).
negative;William Sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles.
negative;For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!
positive;And he's got a message: get your act together and for god's sake, study botany!
positive;The makeup and costumes were great too.
positive;Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done.
negative;"On the pure theatrical side, Last Stand was great, as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that, while not as long or as flashy, are far more historically comprehensive.<br /><br />Certain little details, such as the misuse of the word ""hoplon"" for the Greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words, really ate at me.<br /><br />My guess would be, that because ""Last Stand of the 300"" was aired the eve of the theatrical release of ""300"", the History Channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype.<br /><br />If you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible, you'd have better luck elsewhere."
negative;It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain.
positive;"Warner Baxter's ""Julian Marsh"" is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated."
negative;"But ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" was aired today on TV in Germany and so i watch it."
positive;"It is a ""should see""."
positive;One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar.
negative;For three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to Keith Jarrett's 'Koln Concert'.
positive;Also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos.
positive;He's one of the bests today.
positive;For now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over!!
negative;"a serial killer.Sometimes she recalls Banderas's mother-in-law Tippi Hedren's character in ""Marnie"" .But I wouldn't count on it:Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago ,and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him .Here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end,but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it.The movie includes the obligatory ""conversations with a serial killer"" in the ""silence of the lamb"" tradition,murders (human beings and cats),split personality,and open ending in case the crowds should call for more.Apparently they did not,and they were right."
positive;Still the movie does work.
negative;Celina Jaitley provides the right amount of OOMPH required of a socialite who gets jilted by Reggi (whom she helped get his foot in the record industry's door).
positive;The problem is that he is gay.
negative;I've only a few others to watch besides these films but I believe they were done in great taste.
positive;These animated shorts, much like those still one panel illustrations, have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of Nations, Ideas and Ideals, such as a just and lasting Peace.
negative;Julianne Moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as I'm concerned she was set up to fail.<br /><br />In my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word.
positive;"Both families are competing for the title of ""Filthiest person alive."""
positive;When some attention is pointed toward a certain pimp Sharky looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is being shielded by police forces and political forces and Sharky sets himself up a 24-hour surveillance force to watch her.
positive;<br /><br />This movie defies categorization.
negative;Micheal Ansara was her Husband .
negative;Compare this movie with Barrio, or Riff Raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot The Child).
negative;I'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio get's away with this.
negative;"The story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity I couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard ""quirky"" Japanese story."
positive;The story is simple enough: a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida, and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side.
negative;A combination of quite dreadful acting from both Mark Lester and Telly Savales and plot progression that defies belief.<br /><br />On Telly Saveles: was he drunk when he acted in this?
positive;"There was the use of the word ""coffers"" at the end of the movie."
negative;First of all, they used every cheesy racism clich√© in the book.
negative;What appears on screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer's vengeance:one fellow holding his guts, another with a stake(holding up the group's volleyball net) plunged through his chest, blood spatter after a woman gets hit over the head presumably with a large rock, one chick laying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the SUV, etc.
positive;""".<br /><br />As with every other Perry/Croft series, the cast were excellent, particularly Cadell and Shane."
negative;Too many cheap BOO!
negative;The end result is a prefab love story of predictable schlock, all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary Debbie Boone hit.
negative;Simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination.
positive;Ridley is convicted and goes to prison, and Helen marries a man she doesn't love and leaves for South America.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film, even though at the time, this wasn't an A-list cast.
positive;Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose, are very good indeed.
positive;"This film tries to answer the question ""How far will human beings go to survive?"""
negative;the little respect he had is lost forever.
positive;<br /><br />Though the story, fascinating at times, really isn't this movies greatest success.
positive;Upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence.
negative;He couldn't dance like him, or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice.
negative;Some guy in silly makeup is apparently a Druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world.
positive;No, Slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his .357!
negative;Overall , it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and I still do recommend it - for fun laughs sake.
negative;what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief.
negative;You see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unravelled, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers.
negative;"Every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from ""Wayne's World"" to ""Austin Powers""."
negative;If you're going to have Kathy Ireland in a film in skimpy clothing, it'd better be a bikini.
positive;After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.
negative;"<br /><br />Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct ""experiments"" in which the fate of mankind rests."
negative;Richard Denning plays the hero.
positive;"Overall, there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other Disney classics.<br /><br />One minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in supposedly 1910 Paris; one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present, other than the great deal Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time."
negative;I especially disliked Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict.
negative;This movie was in a box set with 20 others, with varying quality, & I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heap.<br /><br />It is pointless to go through the plot, what there was of it, picking out what was wrong, as I haven't got all day & life is to short, which reminds me, I have just lost around 85 minutes of mine watching this tripe.<br /><br />The acting was diabolically bad in a way that made it funny, though only just, whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any Laurel & Hardy fans groan.
positive;Like them, not all of us made it.
positive;You had to have been there!
positive;Give this one a chance if you can find it!
positive;Rather than spoof Bond, it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'Callan' ( though it had a Bond-style theme tune ).
positive;who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers.
negative;"Fast.<br /><br />Kelly proved to the world after his last movie, ""Southland Tales"", that he is one pretentious director."
positive;"1979 was the zenith of the infamous ""Happy Talk"" format of TV news (see also ""Ron Burgundy"") and it's on display here in all its glory."
positive;I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice.
positive;Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver's horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside & horrible on the inside.
positive;Amazing performances.
positive;We've all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc.
positive;"The prospect of money and fame charms Nini, and she become Danglard's next mistress, as well as an apt student of the cancan, which Danglard has dubbed ""French Cancan,"" to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dance.<br /><br />Both ""42nd St"" and ""French Cancan"" are tributes to show business--to modern entertainment--that has is own iconography and its own conceit."
positive;Harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the hot-dogs for the foursome - he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket).
negative;They really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things.
negative;It's...The Homosexual!<br /><br />The only mystery for the viewer is guessing who The Homosexual is.
negative;am a hardcore horror/thriller fan...when i was searchin for good horror flick to scare me on my weekend night..grabbed HATCHET..with impressing BLOOD STAINED HATCHET movie poster added to average ratings in IMDb..but i was wrong after watchin this crap...no characterisation..sick dialogues,with sexy babes bared boobs.
positive;I'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull.
negative;Beth's estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to see after Sam's condition after they cut the nearly dead young man down taking him to emergency hospital.
negative;Who would trow in some more money to make the effect more life like.
positive;I liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.<br /><br />Delightfully, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie.
positive;I guess the pre-fabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre.
positive;It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it (in all the 3 Schneider movies) without a doubt.
negative;Or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the Holy Water.
positive;It is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin.
negative;The dialogue literally makes no sense, and the acting belongs on a high-school stage.
positive;Thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all of the fun.
negative;The fourth one had to be that zealous dork that Clarie claimed as a boyfriend.
positive;"It's really good to see Van Damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops ""Derailed"" and ""Second in command"" which were both tragic and not in a good way."
negative;The people at ABC forgot to do their biographical research... so many scenes were just plain wrong!
positive;The story has the traces of an afternoon made for TV melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades.
negative;Funnily enough, it was also the year in where Murphy directed his first film, but it also would be the first and last experiment.
positive;The greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting.
positive;"However I feel that this is probably the most important movie of the ""war on terror"" era."
positive;To say any more than that would spoil the surprises in that first scene.
negative;Well, here's what I was looking forward to:<br /><br />1) Bad acting.
negative;not!!
negative;It never really said what that was.
negative;"Thus, the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging (albeit married) lovers pining away for one another, while their ungrateful, insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes.<br /><br />One of the major problems with ""Baghban"" is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction."
positive;Alright, so maybe the impersonations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen.
positive;The performances were excellent, as was the story.
positive;It works on many levels.<br /><br />In a very well choreographed opening we are voyeurs at a family dinner where obviously something has gone awry and results in a father and two sons taking off in a car and having an accident in which one of the sons is killed.
positive;While I rather enjoyed this movie, I'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't.
negative;There isn't a Screenplay, It's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
negative;I could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily THE WORST movie I have ever seen.
negative;stay away from this terrible piece of c**p. save your money !
negative;Sugar and Quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans.
negative;(It's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation.)
positive;They are doing a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons.
negative;The film mentions another director Wu Yuen Ling as well as the one IMDb lists.
positive;The monsters want mainly to mind their own business, warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided, wanting to join there society.<br /><br />By the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes....
positive;She puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character.
positive;But I just had a question about the music is the movie.
positive;If you love cinema and you want to try Chinese movies you can start here.
negative;"), and credits featuring absolutely no-one I had heard of, I reckoned it would be pretty lousy.<br /><br />It was!<br /><br />When a film clocks in at just under an hour long, it really shouldn't waste too much time before getting to the action; Granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely banal conversation."
negative;In the previous versions, wit was the tool for escape, not technology.
negative;this one is no exception.
negative;At one point she even makes out with the rotten creature!<br /><br />After the final battle and the stupid woman is vaporized or whatever, the so called hero is left alone to pack up his copy of Michael Moore's Dude Where's My Country and can't resist smoking that stick one more time to try to rescue his moron lady friend.
negative;May be I missed something, go see it for yourself.
negative;The production is one gigantic mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, truly hideous photography, poor lighting, lousy acting and directing, laughable gore and zilch tension or atmosphere.
negative;this movie was boring and did nothing for me, I recommend this movie to no one.
negative;They all get a big kick out of watching themselves mug for the camera.
negative;Universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original.
negative;Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable.
positive;I've been a fan of Dennis Farina since 'Crime Story,' another late, lamented show.
positive;I believe this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series.
negative;"After some innocent cavorting, the attractive collegiates discover another couple has encountered a monster; naturally, the creature is hell-bent on terrorizing young romantics."
positive;Some of the lines are classic, as when Gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at CAA.
negative;What great thinking.
negative;But this movie absolutely stank, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy.
positive;Though set ostensibly in post-Civil War America, this isn't an America recognisable from myth, cinema, TV etc.
negative;The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren.
positive;You do see two deaths that I remember, one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid.
negative;But wait!
positive;Being a tough but gallant man, you might just be able to guess much of what happens next.<br /><br />The action is very good in the film and Jim Brown is menacing and tough.
negative;You sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values.
negative;As it is, read your Shakespeare.
negative;I give it 4 stars out of 10 --if your 12 years old, and dont know better, then you might love it.
positive;This movie, when hopefully it becomes available on DVD, will be a must buy.
positive;I hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious.
negative;This film caused unnecessary bridge-waiting and the world is a worse place for it.
positive;Think you have what it takes to become a Legend?
negative;Samantha's going back and forth from LA choked the story flow, especially when she comes in for Fashion Week and nothing happens.
negative;But then again, Norris produced the show as well as starred in it, so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are.
positive;Who doesn't want to be famous?
negative;"The guys in ""robot"" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole ""plot"" isn't a robot either.<br /><br />The whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set."
positive;Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add some humor here playing a couple of goofballs - Durante's character is actually studying to be a dentist via mail-order and continually has onshore run-ins with a British man who makes fun of his nose.
negative;John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported.
negative;They're irreplaceable.<br /><br />Nope.
positive;"It's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as Fata Morgana; knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more.<br /><br />http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/"
negative;Only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles.
positive;Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of Robin Hood it all works.
negative;"She is the ""daughter of the regiment"", loved as a little sister."
positive;The movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a woman director, much like Ms. Breillat.
positive;Amazingly, the film flopped and Wayne spent most of the following decade in Grade B Western fodder.
negative;Not much else happens.
negative;I watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time (while baby is sleeping) watching this film.
negative;Man, this would have been a bad episode of the original series.
negative;He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb.
positive;It's very enthralling, and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human ways--you can't help but pull for the triumph of justice, and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true story.<br /><br />It's a shame more people haven't seen this documentary, but hopefully you will find a way to watch it.
positive;A coincidence?
positive;First, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, Jeanne, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn't think about.
negative;I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.
positive;The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent.
negative;"They would have all been over to Zanzibar faster than you can say ""performance art""."
positive;The world loved to imagine that they were into black magic(k) etc.
positive;"The sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of ""A Christmas Story"", which I also love."
positive;Predictably, Tucsos escapes and the surviving troopers and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway.<br /><br />Although Drum expects a relief column of 400 troopers to arrive any day, Harmony points out to Lance that Tucsos will attack.
negative;He says stupid things, does stupid things, has obviously never seen a horror movie, and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for.
negative;Eventually the nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end.
positive;In fairness, I am judging this on the acting and directing, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
negative;Based on that question, does it deliver the goods?
positive;I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, so will you.
positive;This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovsk√Ω is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details.
negative;The actors look like they're training with their gym buddy.
positive;Indian culture and Catholicism is linked by superstition, ritual, greed and murder.
positive;"It could happen; two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath."
positive;This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time.
positive;Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, pass√© way.
positive;The narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events.
positive;I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it.
negative;The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him became he is a local veterinarian for Buddy.<br /><br />The animal story is too simple.
positive;This flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
positive;We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10.
negative;Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically, finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent.
negative;Possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie.
negative;It is understandable why this director has so many aliases.
positive;God's Words in the Bible is eternal...but Anne's diary is a diary of a young girl under extraordinary circumstances, and that is it.
negative;<br /><br />The characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) get the police to help, C) escape, or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER!!!
negative;The dialogue is bad.
negative;"I recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are Jewish and simply wanting to see a nice ""fantasy justice."""
positive;It has embelleshments.
positive;The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front.
positive;On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing.
positive;WOW I Love this movie.
positive;"After three hours of watching it, besides having my brain hurt, I learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes.<br /><br />The last hour of the show was about ""String Theory"" Physics, a semi-new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible, but PROBABLE."
negative;Give me a break.<br /><br />Don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series.
positive;"It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than I.<br /><br />For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the ""How to be a Man"" cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.<br /><br />Sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...few movies are perfect."
negative;People watched films to be entertained.
positive;Shah rukh khan plays an obbsessed lover who would go to any lengths to get his lady.
negative;No, this is Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind.
positive;He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.<br /><br />Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr.
positive;The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism.
negative;"Shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, ""Evil Dead"" kind of way.<br /><br />Without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre."
negative;"I suppose among some men, this is enough to make ""Succubare"" a horror movie..."
negative;Here's my advice: Gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it.
negative;"If that is the intended ""twist"" in this film, that's pretty sad."
positive;And Lemmy from the house of Motorhead narrates.
positive;Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one.
positive;<br /><br />Roy Scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor I can think off like Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie.
negative;They could have done better.
negative;My advice: Google Ed Gein, you'll be far more entertained.
positive;'.<br /><br />'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' cast Jason as 'Edgar Briggs', a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service.
negative;An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough.
positive;But pride from either is no answer at all.<br /><br />Rather, it's the answer of Addicus we need, comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy, not pride, when facing each other in our differences.
negative;Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion.
negative;"But seems choppy, fake and artificial, when used for furry creatures like werewolves.<br /><br />However there were a few things that saved this one from total ""turkeydom"", there's one hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he drops a bunch of condoms on the table, and tries to pass them off as chewing gum, by chewing and blowing a bubble!"
negative;It's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks.
positive;"Some have complained about the murky lighting, and the illogical nature of the sets - but for me, the use of innovating lighting techniques, the plastic and sheet draped sets, the unusual settings in old buildings and dank, dripping tunnels, the use of statuary, rain and billowing curtains - all add a poetic flavor to this film, a haunting beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions being asked about life, death and forgiveness.<br /><br />I will focus on just two examples; in an alley scene, a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus, then to fade away once lighting returns to normal."
negative;'Tweety's S.O.S' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's definitely one to avoid.
positive;Although, the early Dad's Army episodes, with their staid pace and over arcing plot, lent themselves far better to film adaptation.
negative;I was stuck in the middle.
negative;In this one, he attacks without success and gets pummeled.
positive;Ron Eldard gave a wonderful performance.
positive;"Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the chief villain in ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven,"" is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader Tucsos.<br /><br />""Only the Valiant"" opens with over-voice narration by Army Scout Joe Harmony."
positive;Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage.
positive;Now imagine if you actually cared about Meat Loaf or Voyager to begin with!
positive;I do not have any negative views.<br /><br />I only would like to make one request.
negative;Gotta love that crap!
negative;No I can't say that I have.
negative;<br /><br />The movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie.
negative;There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress in Imperium suits the part much better.
positive;It is Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) traces Pip down to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions the gift should be opened on Pip's 18th birthday.<br /><br />Pip, though drinking too much and full of anger, pawns the tape machine but keeps the tape and begins to listen to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice by Ian McKellen) who recounts his own 18th birthday in WW II in France where he (now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with a wounded medic named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also superb) and reflects on his one night marriage with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of 'Queer as Folk' fame and a fine singer and actress here), only for something to live for during the war: Jason offers succor to Macauley as he dies, with a beautiful scene of redemption for he two men at the end.
negative;I found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out.
negative;why are British film makers trying to imitate such characterless, spectacle driven, tabloid level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the Americans.
negative;Let me start by saying I don't recall laughing once during this comedy.
positive;"It always feels very real and thanks to the film's low-key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings, the film's dramatic impact does not lessen.<br /><br />Easily recommended; 10 out of 10."
negative;¬ñ atypical) and is the best part of the movie.
positive;Not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance.
positive;It is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.
negative;A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship.
negative;"Centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but wait for it, then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime, therefore being ""drawn by pain"", so clever."
positive;I haven't actually seen a lot of movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise.
positive;The black & white photography enhances the dire nature of this western.
positive;disappointing but with some great acting.
positive;Overall, taken with a bit of humor, I loved it.<br /><br />
negative;I can't believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is weirdly bad.
positive;At the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, I would give it a 7/10.
negative;Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an Oscar nom.
positive;"MISSISSIPPI MERMAID is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the ""wrong"" person.<br /><br />Truffaut's directing is his usual outstanding work."
positive;And if all nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, perhaps catching smallpox wouldn't seem like such a bad break, after all.
positive;In fact, the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie, or in human history.
positive;It was returned and put back where it belonged!
negative;But anyway, Nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman.
negative;"His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film.<br /><br />Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.<br /><br />Along the way of being pursued, Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent.<br /><br />The story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War 11, realism becomes the object of the day.<br /><br />The near-ending scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to.<br /><br />Very interesting that while Pidgeon is fleeing Nazi Germany, he meets up again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon's many co-stars that same year in the memorable ""How Green Was My Valley."""
negative;Just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam.
negative;** from ****
negative;This is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash.
negative;It was mediocre at best.<br /><br />Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role.
negative;"""<br /><br />ATC: ""Sir, arm spoilers now, confirm brake pressure at 250 psi."
negative;When nobody returns to the kingdom from the battle, the king renders the land of battle cursed and forbids anyone from going there.
negative;The only interesting thing (not funny) was a pointless courtroom scene with Rob Reiner Jr. (and try to spot his then-wife Penny Marshall as a spectator).<br /><br />Actually this movie could have been worse--the original ending had Segal getting into bed with his MOTHER and pretending he's poppa!
positive;Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its best characters.
negative;"The many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascists pompously whining (;-)) on about their achievements.<br /><br />I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary, concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored."
negative;I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what little suspense was mustered.
negative;"Carols Mencia also likes to say, ""If you're offended, too bad""."
positive;That makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is nonetheless pretty inventive.
negative;There`s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise , since Mister Lumpke has told Sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much .
negative;John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film.
negative;so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk.
negative;There's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious Indian dude who keeps disappearing.
positive;You may find yourself in tears.
positive;The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka.
negative;I saw this song on MST 3K, and as awful as it was, it had it's moments, and that song was one of them.<br /><br />If you like babes in bikinis, this is the movie for you, but if you don't, then don't bother.
positive;A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too, most notably Nikki Kelly's 'Sylvia' and statuesque Rikki Howard's 'Betty'.
positive;Preston (also Mature's junior) plays Colonel Marston, missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man.
positive;Heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks.
positive;I loved every single character throughout the game: not just their personalities and wit, but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctively.
positive;That he is a man's man, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more on target.
positive;<br /><br />This is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time.
positive;....The Big Snit.
negative;The director was so busy with character development, that he completely missed the point of a good story.. excuse me koalas?
positive;Hell, teenage angst-inspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies.
positive;"It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect Hitch used at the end of ""Spellbound"", also).<br /><br />All in all, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fun film to watch."
negative;Since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the Latino immigrants of the neighborhood.
positive;During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring.
positive;Katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns.
positive;Either way, it's a very good film, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.
positive;He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way.
negative;First, what is really great about this movie: <br /><br />- Ryan Reynolds, great acting!
positive;One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together.
negative;"The rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called ""Horror Express"" and a disaster movie called ""The Cassandra Crossing."""
negative;They're iconoclastic, outrageous.
positive;Surprised to know that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and bored with so many predictable movies, I was delighted with the script showing so many small stories and cues spread here and there.
negative;Why?
negative;Even she was a huge disappointment.
negative;Prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album.
negative;In all the most disappointing Altman film I've ever seen.
positive;Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her?
negative;There was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device, but it was not that serious, clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be.
negative;"The only thing you need to memorize is that ""El Chupacabre"" is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur B-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style."
positive;Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism.
negative;In short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts.
negative;People are claiming to see dark figures in the basement... Well, we will just go and see about that... while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room.
negative;Vine-ally, a good shot with a Remmington hits a knife lodged in the Tabonga, and it falls over dead into the quicksand.
positive;I haven't taken much action lately and I wonder how many people have.
negative;Actually, it's the MEN who are the seducers here.<br /><br />But it's not the main action of this ludicrous film that's so objectionable.
positive;Throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in Burma, witnesses the Democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of Rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour-guide's (U Aung Ko's) life, she is regaining her will to live.
negative;"While that was what Knautz was going for, he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies had.<br /><br />The problem with ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horror-comedies, that it tries to evoke, so great in the first place."
positive;"Seven ups had a few ""jumps"" over little hills, (Yawn) but of course they were not San Francisco hills."
negative;For some reason I don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size.
negative;It seems like the writer saw Pitch Black and got upset because he didn't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version.
negative;It isn't, though the film is an exercise in bad taste, complete with a title-earning scene where two of the pretty supporting ladies are quite literally sliced up and eaten alive by cannibals which is the film's high point.
negative;I watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it.
positive;Plus I didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't.
positive;Her brand of Indian English too, is so spontaneous and natural.
positive;And even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play.
negative;Her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it.
negative;While sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy I couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to secure Freeman for this film.
negative;In the middle of the everlasting mayhem this kind of reflections lack credibility.
positive;His acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humour.
negative;<br /><br />The movie Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi.
negative;1.
positive;It is a nice part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man.
negative;I hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after Cyborg Cop.
positive;The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie.
negative;And Kemp actually put in an OK performance.
positive;So, if you ever get an opportunity to see this movie, don't automatically regard it as unworthy of your time.
positive;It is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).
positive;At the time Mike Weed was the hot stuff, along with Russ Whats-his-name, with the Z-boys hot on their tail.
negative;The only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.<br /><br />I give it a big fat RASPBERRY!
positive;<br /><br />Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7, I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!
positive;Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California.
positive;Overall, Starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.
positive;And while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low, you will see the results.
negative;his house?
positive;Thanks Bruce.
positive;He has a few funny lines and if this was a Meg Ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg.
negative;"However, the existence of films like ""Graduation Day"" is, without pun, a thorn in my side."
negative;My wife and I never got into the movie.We thought it was way to sloooowwww and to many subtitles.I understood they needed them for Vietnam,but took to long to get out of Asia.She wanted it off I said it's going to get better.It never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to America,but I wanted to see him looking and finding his dad.Not at the end but forming a relationship.Did I mention it was slllloooowwwwww.I love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end.I know they don't make many good movies now days.I think action movies are the only ones to watch.I have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster,maybe 20% are worth seeing.I don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.Gary
negative;The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behaviour in this event.
negative;"In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland in person - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of ""Necessary Roughness."""
negative;I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel.
negative;They have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together.
positive;John Hurt *is* the Storyteller.
negative;they are better actors and superheroes.
positive;The show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted, taking in important facets such as faith, religion, funding, means and needs.
negative;It's like ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes.<br /><br />Sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating, because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of potheads and you are the only one who hasn't smoked anything.<br /><br />So unless you are prepared to intoxicate yourself to make this bearable, or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny, my advice on this is: Stay way.
negative;I hope you're currently unemployed and reading this.)
positive;I just found a VHS tape of a few episodes, and a music CD from the show on ebay, and I bought them right up, even though they were a little pricey.
positive;As such, it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed.
positive;At the time, I had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was...and how that would effect their friendship.
positive;it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed racer, be it dubbed or subbed (i prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny...in a good way).
negative;i have seen many Japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same.
negative;"The ""acting"" and comedic gore effects are lousy but I guess that's to be expected since this is nothing more then a home video.<br /><br />On the bright side, I guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie."
negative;In the film, the dance at which Darcy snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy families belong, but is rather the dancing of the lower classes.
negative;"In fact, it's a surprise not to see Harry Alan Towers' name on the credits; it certainly has the flavour of one of his tax-shelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in Provence."
negative;I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong?
negative;"Ben Destin = ""Been Destined"", Gus Pelman = ""Gospel Man"", Nicky D = Nicodemus."
negative;Ed Wood rides again.
negative;"This inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success.<br /><br />Was it the so called ""Amazonian natives"" who looked like they were Bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in Sri Lanka), or the inept ""decapitation"" and ""castration"" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in ""Cannibal Holocaust""?"
positive;Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away.
positive;"If you were in any way disappointed with the home version, or perhaps thought it was ""too much,"" you might find a much more likable and straight forward game of Soul Calibur in the arcade."

positive;It just didn't rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film I strongly recommend you see.
negative;Evan Almighty is the scariest film of all time.<br /><br />All in all I thought it was a wasted experience.
positive;I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all.
negative;"Watching ""Baghban"" is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one's way out of a vat of saltwater taffy for nigh unto three hours."
negative;The whole problem was so simple to solve and yet millions of people apparently didn't think of simply going upstairs!
positive;"It's not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.<br /><br />The term ""rendition"" refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law."
negative;please, writer/creator let us in on the joke!
negative;"God, how I would like to take out my 2 completely wasted hours of time on his a$$.<br /><br />To give you guys a few pointers of the ""film"": <br /><br />1."
negative;"Or, to paraphrase a review of ""Heaven's Gate: ""It's as if Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the Devil for the success of a TV series, and Devil is just now coming around to collect."
negative;I didn't laugh at all while watching this trash.
negative;Let's go through the fact here folks.
positive;Also, the voices of Gregg Berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as the hilariously inept Ajax, and Nancy Travis as the sex-starved, obnoxious Sister-in-Law Bernice, all contribute in a full amount.
negative;"Sound good to you?"""
negative;Yes, even though the title distinctively mentions butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a female baker.
positive;But really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized.
negative;The plot is very bad and the Dennis Michael Tenney's musical score is pitiful.
positive;The ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre.
negative;Yes, formulaic.
negative;There are cows and bulls and all males in the bovine species are bulls and do not have udders!!!!
negative;They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although he wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot.
positive;That's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie.
positive;If someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated.
positive;"""L'appartement"" has to be among the best French films I have ever seen (along with ""Hatred"", also starring Vincent Cassel, and those great Gerard D√©pardieu/Pierre Richard movies)."
positive;i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party.
positive;Maybe the next generation will have them.<br /><br />The movie is still a lot of fun and both Reynolds and Ward are great-looking actors in their prime.
positive;It is the impact it has on you that makes the difference.
negative;<br /><br />What's left to say?
negative;"It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum, and straws and presents it as ""Hannibal Crossing the Alps""."
negative;I don't know.<br /><br />The hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.<br /><br />Worst of all, this film features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open.
positive;The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film.
positive;Baz's Moulin Rouge... well, Paris doesn't put that kind of stuff in the Seine anymore.
positive;The writing, acting, directing could not have been better.
negative;"Another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten, and despite his undead friend's warnings, by the light of the full moon he sprouts fur, fangs, and claws!<br /><br />But there are some differences in the story, for one; the girl is one of the werewolves."
negative;I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show.
positive;WATCH it.
positive;Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick.
negative;However, I was utterly disappointed.
negative;Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is.
negative;Dan Akroyd I thought was bad.

positive;Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house for a reading of his play, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm.
negative;"Fortunately, a print of this film was found, in France, and restored.<br /><br />The description, ""The Dragon Painter is a fantasy-allegory of love and creative inspiration that is lost when longing is fulfilled,"" is accurate."
positive;Truly romantic films are so rare these days, while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound.
positive;Elsewhere TV image.
positive;Tucsos has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength.
negative;He would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series.
positive;I had literally no idea how this film was going to end, because it went left when I expected it to go right, zigged when I expected a zag, etc.
negative;The absurd and deadpan communication between the characters ?
negative;Mystery Science Theatre disciples beware, this is soul-sucking cinema.
positive;This enchanting tale is a great spin off of others, but is well worth buying!
positive;This is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical Breillat style.
positive;We could've had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band.
negative;Worst plot, worst acting, worst special effects...be prepared if you want to watch this.
negative;This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic pretension that man will ever know.
positive;Tim Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing.
positive;This is possibly one of my favorite films.
positive;Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place!!!
positive;(who could forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?).
positive;Apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3,5 hours.
positive;Thomas Gibson, as David, is outstanding as the moody and self-deceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve.
positive;She gives you a glimpse of today's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's prior relationships.
positive;Matching up with Walking With Dinosaurs, this documentary stands as one of the best.
negative;So, the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school.
negative;As if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time.
negative;"I think I'll watch ""The Rapture"" again."
negative;"This film has been compared to the hilarious British comedy ""A Fish Called Wanda"", although I can't see why."
negative;The only way I can rationalize the good ratings on here is that you guys were paid to give this movie high ratings.
negative;The second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone (ex: Katie and franklin) .
negative;They get drunk every night.
negative;<br /><br />Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson.
positive;Reading the Joyce short story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this film.
negative;"It's okay, nothing more.<br /><br />All in all, there are many and far better movies to spend your time on, but if your time isn't that valuable (as is apparently the case with my own) you can check this little film out.<br /><br />""Ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti-masters of cinema."
positive;As I have said before in previous comments, some programmes are there to be 'Light entertainment'.
positive;The music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.<br /><br />But for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character.
positive;Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things.
positive;Even if that wasn't intended, it's still a movie that I recommend to everyone.
positive;This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing.
negative;I have a lot more to say about this film but I really don't want to go there.
positive;"Unfortunately, her delicacy on film was also a part of her real life; she committed suicide at age 45.<br /><br />I end this review with this observation: one manipulative, lying Yankee man is no match for a houseful of deceptive and libidinous Southern belles."
negative;Unfortunately, they're overshadowed by the diffuse, incoherent script and some bad acting.
positive;Glad to see Bebe Neuwirth in a recurring role, but feel Andre Braugher is underutilized.
positive;[Harry Crystal]
positive;), but Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic 'Mr.Partridge' and Felix Bowness' jockey 'Fred Qulley' more than compensated.
positive;Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.
positive;I cried.
negative;If you can't outsmart this egghead, you deserve what's coming to you.
positive;I love older films and this is or should be considered a classic!
positive;His rich upper class father plans on tossing him out on his ear, though thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms.<br /><br />At this point, there are two women in his life--showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged).
negative;This is a poorly written and badly directed short film, pure and simple.
positive;The helplessness of Meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of.
negative;There are costume and hair problems, too.
positive;The acting by the leads, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film I can watch over and over.
negative;Positive that that particular tidbit wasn't just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences (y'know the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie)?
positive;Can't give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie.
negative;I really really want Cloud 10 to make a good Left Behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2.
positive;Many thanks to Julie for her graciousness and friendship.
negative;"No surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the ""final girl"" to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.<br /><br />The story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release."
negative;Creepy, and then just plain boring.
negative;The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine company's campaign to get rid of the historic forests.
positive;<br /><br />Though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum, and might offend some people.
negative;This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a good heart that puts others before himself.
negative;The film is even worse than any of those Saturday afternoon B-movies because the acting is laughable, the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie, well, what can I say...
negative;As a kid, I had enjoyed it.
negative;"The story itself is actually OK, but it's just how it's done, Jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man, while her dad, who sports a great moustache, just walks around the house all day while looking angry, just showing how bad the characterisation is, especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase ""no more"" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface."
positive;It's a good rent.
positive;Perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely.<br /><br />Recommended especially for martial artists.
negative;The main character was bland and uninteresting.
positive;This is the most human and humane of movies that I have seen in a long time.
positive;However, as the story progressed, and the cast moved on to just about only Jill most of the time, I was able to appreciate the movie more.
positive;As many already said, seeing Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby are great in this 1981 piece.
positive;I still remember watching Satya for the first time.
positive;Taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities.
negative;There are different aspects a sports movie can take.
positive;I had only written one review on IMDb prior to this, as I consider most games as unworthy of the time and effort...Curse of Monkey Island is different.<br /><br />Having played and been impressed by Monkey 1 and 2, I had great expectations for the third release...and was not disappointed.
negative;It features not only ambient noises (captured by mikes and not replaced in post), but there is a lot of shrieking.
positive;Some of them are not so far fetched as they seemed back then.
positive;His ability to make the child actors feel like real characters, to involve the adults less, and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding.
negative;Heroine is played by perpetually pouting Gloria Lynn Berg.
negative;You have been warned.
positive;Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver.
positive;Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker).
positive;Even they got me on that scenes.
positive;One involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?)
positive;"Think ""P iss Christ"" or menstrual blood paintings of the Virgin Mary."
positive;What Arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character's heart without words.
negative;The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour.
negative;As it is, he comes across, not as a regal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is.
negative;AND, they kept the poem from Steppenwolf <br /><br />With love,<br /><br />Caitlin
positive;Exciting, action-packed, and interesting film telling the tale of a group of men stationed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a Navy submarine during WWI.
positive;Every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing.
negative;Who thought it was a good idea to start the film out by showing a giant map?
positive;If you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but, anyone who says Kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self-serving and costly strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia.
positive;She gets life in prison.
negative;(I was watching alone too).
positive;This show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself, must see for anyone at all interested in this genre
negative;"Those people are good enough only to be stand ins or body doubles in other C movies and be credited AT MOST collectively as ""stunt crew provided by the county prison ""."
positive;There are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse, the sort of role that Hollywood loves & romanticizes but which here is absolutely convincing & unlike any character I've encounterd in film or in life.
positive;Also, I'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.
positive;I know because I came out smiling feeling wonderful.
negative;Other than that, find the most obscure video rental store in your town, get the movie, invite all your friends over, and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
positive;What they do not expect is to encounter the notorious Clegg murderers, with their wounded leader Uncle Shiloh(Charles Kemper).
negative;So yep, life is grand.
negative;It's pure shock value.<br /><br />On the upside, it makes the Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.
negative;The horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act.
negative;Time is precious.
positive;"People frown upon the show due to its ""perverted"" idea of picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization, but truth be told, practically every young guy is out doing it at the club."
positive;This would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son, which were totally opposite of how they lived before, especially the sex, and also would also explain why Peggy got away with murder, etc.
positive;The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film.
negative;"I have some of the ""books"" that were written based on the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they're pretty light duty, so I didn't expect much from the movie."
negative;What was his whole fight at the end turned out to be useless and misleading for what the audience believes is happening.
negative;To have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie!
positive;I give this movie 10 out of 10.
positive;Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras.
positive;Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true.
negative;<br /><br />I think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts, this moving could have been way better.
positive;The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated.
negative;With House Party 4, Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a Hollywood film.
negative;"""<br /><br />Finally, the vengeful ""perfect wife"" in this flick dispatches those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent ""button man"" in Don Corleone's family could muster."
negative;From the first minute future developments are clear as water.
positive;That makes him seem more monstrous.
positive;Normally, his suggestions aren't much cop however, but I was stuck for something to watch so I watched it.<br /><br />Well, to cut a long story short, I give it 10/10.<br /><br />The film centers around two people, that meet whilst lodging at the same place.
negative;If we need a pouting heroine in the movie, why not pick better known actress Bernadette Peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well?
negative;Each episode halfheartedly tries to 'deal with issues' such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive pupils, and rocket building(!)...
negative;I'm just a child.
positive;Besides, it's better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up.
positive;I admit, some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but so what, every movie rips off another to some extent.
negative;Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in her gunshot wound because he suspects she betrayed him.
positive;Directed with black humor and taste, I loved the tension between the very Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson.
positive;It's one of the most critical phases of our lives, when changes come fast and furious whether we're ready or not.
negative;"""A Texas community is beset with a rash of mysterious killings involving some of the students from the local college."
positive;For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved into the then-present.
negative;Nice black&white photography and pretty much nothing else - unless being bored silly can be considered an asset.
positive;It's impossible to imagine someone else as the adorable (and dumb) Junior.<br /><br />- Jennifer Nicole Freeman: the egocentric Claire found the perfect actress.
positive;I am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch.<br /><br />You can sure tell Berry follows in his dad footsteps, they talk alike and have the same mannerisms.<br /><br />Would enjoy anything they do separately.<br /><br />Will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together.
positive;India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change.
positive;I've also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies, if you want to check it out.
negative;It was indulgent and convoluted.
positive;Postcoital scenes abound.<br /><br />Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo, he has discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her fiddle.
negative;Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love.
negative;"I could always say ""this doesn't make sense, this neither..."" This movie is pure crap at his best."
positive;Simply from the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero- and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favorize any sex.<br /><br />In Hans Epp's case there are the women who drive him into despair, illness and finally death.
negative;Not one bit.
negative;"Don't waste the hour of your life; you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on Nick at Nite."
negative;If anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen.
negative;For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger.
negative;Even his supposedly smart assistant, who is always dressed professionally, keeps looking at Charlie like he's just the most wonderful, handsomest, greatest guy around.
positive;It can't simply be that the song itself is a lot of fun, and Michael Jackson ¬ñ though he has since become the butt of all comedians' jokes for his peculiar personality and doings ¬ñ there's no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer.
negative;Honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act.
positive;The movie was released locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion (bombing/mishap?
positive;A godawful American remake has been made!
positive;Fortunately, seeing it again years later, it held up fairly well.
negative;The girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.<br /><br />I don't really know what the heck happens after that.
negative;is incredibly annoying.<br /><br />I was finally so annoyed by the never-ending dialogue that I fast-forwarded to the end.
negative;She would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period.<br /><br />If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period.
negative;I'm sorry but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion.
positive;It's a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile.
negative;I hope they're pretending.
positive;I have been a huge fan of Emile's and Ryan's for a long time, and I thought they have never been better.
positive;The original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie (2 times now).
positive;!<br /><br />The musical numbers were so imaginative!
positive;Far, far better than it would seem likely given the ingredients.
negative;House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off.
positive;The Kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another bout of hysterics.
negative;Granted , the special effects do well on T.V.
negative;Through hard labour, Philip has earned a halfpenny: Tom tries to bully it away from him, but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force: he wants Philip to *give* it to him.
negative;I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason has only a small role in this film.
negative;2 out of 10. doesn't get a 1/10 because of the thunderdome fight.
positive;To this day, this movie I consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there.
positive;While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack.
negative;"Combine those considerations with the recycled footage, stomach churning scenes of animal violence, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stagy, wooden methodology of film-making and what you get ends up being an OK jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes, and Umberto Lenzi was capable of so much more.<br /><br />4/10; Gore freaks will go nuts however."
positive;Indeed, while all the cast handle their roles perfectly (bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great Beckinsale), it is Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby that shines the most.
negative;"I was rolling my eyes when that ""twist"" was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there (not to mention flashing back to Star Wars ""Amir, Hassan is your brother"" ""NOOOoo, that's not true, that's IMPOSSIBLE!"")"
positive;In this movie, he makes a great idiot.
positive;Trivia: this was actually filmed in Faulkner's home town of Oxford, Miss.
negative;"Hey' we made it, so it's gotta be good, right?"""
positive;Apparently there is no national Infectious Diseases authority to co-ordinate things or send in back-up.<br /><br />I'm not a horror aficionado, so any horror I do see is usually mingled with humour.
positive;"I can still hear it:""Oh my big strong burrito!!"""
positive;This picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties.
positive;A special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj.The villain's character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well.
negative;Even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion, considering Gein was a smallish man, and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine.
positive;The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent.
positive;*** from ****
positive;I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.<br /><br />The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself.
negative;How much WORSE can the horror genre get?
negative;When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe.
negative;To me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the Cold War.
positive;Alright, I'm 12, so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre-teen's point of view.
positive;By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazz-musicions in germany (maybe europe).
negative;Jesus' bro vs. pimps...come on.
positive;With his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and most of all himself.
negative;Its almost embarrassing to say I even saw this movie.
negative;"This film doesn't fall into the category √Øts so bad its good"" for me either/<br /><br />Overall 2/10 the director/writer/editor should know better."
negative;they recommended it to me mind you!
negative;Sure the movie gets people talking about the storyline and what not, but that was not the only flaw in this film.
negative;The screenplay is horrible.
negative;And once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you'll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven.
negative;it is shameful that such a respectful actor has stooped to such a low on making such a disgraceful movie.
negative;The 1977 animated-live action hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather 'Travel,' since he only gets as far as Lilliput) didn't get much of a release, and it's not too difficult to see why.
negative;The cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized, utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly.
negative;i lost a lot of the little respect i had for NIN.
negative;It is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already, and forget about the day after.<br /><br />I just got a note from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough.
positive;i thought it was great.
negative;The new celebrity deathmatch is terrible.
negative;Even the film and sound quality was terrible.
negative;First he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.<br /><br />It could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn't even live up to my grade Z schlock expectations.
positive;Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman.
positive;I wish that there could have been a few more revealing scenes of her, but it was still a very good movie.
negative;True, there are more historical accuracies than in Rome, but dramatically speaking, it's plain boring.
positive;"Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film 'Once,' including the latter's theme song, ""Falling."""
positive;Great job!
negative;Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most.
negative;I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?<br /><br />I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.<br /><br />I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms.
positive;"Valentine ""Dogkiller"" Dussaut and Joe ""The Judge"" Kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of Geneva!"
negative;I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value.
positive;It is for the individual to decide where he or she stands.
negative;Had the director's interpretation coincided with mine, perhaps I might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals.<br /><br />I much preferred the version from 1982.
negative;You remember those cheap video effects from 70's and 80's music videos that make them look so dated, like a picture within a picture flying through the screen?
positive;When did that come about?
negative;<br /><br />Love, jealously, deceitfulness, this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the Shakespeare novel.
positive;This Western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by Western Union.
negative;However, they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim, only intimations that IBM's security surrounding the computer room was because IBM really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions, and Kasparov's assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two.
positive;Bravo, Tom!
negative;Sorry, I know that is classic stereotyping on my part.
positive;Yesterday i watched it again on DVD.
positive;Its an unending search within each of one of us...<br /><br />The powerhouse performance from Shabana Azmi is a treat to watch.
negative;You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain.
negative;What a horrible mistake.
negative;Miroku and Sango... they have some color but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much.
negative;Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter.
negative;Overall, this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe.
positive;He is arrested and eventually remanded to the very man he is attempting to stop.
negative;He and his partner (who is soon to be transferred, or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the Mayor's office.
positive;He's not your conventional cab driver.<br /><br />This guys got issues.
positive;"There are other spy films more worth seeking out than ""The Falcon and the Snowman"", but it is a decent film none the less."
negative;"Final verdict - King of the ""so bad they're funny"" genre, anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy."
negative;If you find Rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy Imperium: Augustus.
negative;Now that does take some kind of talent, right?
positive;The movie was excellent, save for some of the scenes with Esposito.
positive;While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying.
positive;Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture.
positive;The thwarted wife is almost convincing - 7 years marriage and she and Rickman's character should be more settled with each other, whether their roles are to be incompatible or not - they must have patterns by now.
negative;"This movie borrows from ""The Core"" and from the film it borrowed from, ""Armageddon"", and the films it borrowed from and so on."
positive;Terrance Stamp is great in it, the music is sweet, Carol White is very believeable as the single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals.<br /><br />My favourite scene is where Carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye) sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past.<br /><br />The only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of Carol's first husband, but if you can get past that, you're OK. And Donovan provides some of the most languid, mellow, bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s.
positive;The film is directed by Davis' husband, who almost seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works.<br /><br />I pull out this DVD and rewatch it often.
negative;"Ooh and don't forget the oh so idiotic ""finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who, surprise surprise, has turned into a psychopathic adult"" (trust me guys, I understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that'll never happen."
positive;"In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors (""Mr. Chow,"" played by Tony Leung and ""Mrs. Chan,"" played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try ""not to be like them."""
negative;I finally decided to watch it because I like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact.
positive;I fell in love at first sight with this one, and I assure you that, at the very least, you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm.
negative;Although she was attached to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film.
positive;The only problem is, the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one.
negative;The kung fu craze had begun and Bruce Lee and ''The Chinese Connection'' would soon follow either that or ''The Chinese Boxer'' with Jimmy Wang Yu .
positive;As movies go, this is a fairly gentle education.
negative;People fall out of them, baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches, engines fail, they sustain damage from AAA, the are torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better.<br /><br />Some might find this funnier than I did, and the acting is pretty good.
positive;)<br /><br />Travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe.
positive;"The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of ""heat"" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships."
negative;The acting is worse than in the films we made when we were 10 years old with a camcorder, the effects look like some 80's computer game and the plot is worse than terrible.
negative;Then came the trailer.
negative;YOU JUST CAN'T miss.
positive;Objects fell to bits in his hands.
positive;The acting and directing are very powerful.<br /><br />2.
positive;Although there are many facets of Lindbergh's life, the segment featured here is his efforts to be the First Man to fly across the Atlantic.
positive;The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodini's strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness.
positive;Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek).
positive;The acting in Mute Witness isn't great, but the leading actress (who's Russian herself) looks really cute.
negative;""", scolds Dr. Brandon."
positive;Well, I'm definitely not joining - I can't imagine heaven without both!
positive;So be it!!
positive;Improbable is not the same as far-fetched.
negative;Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right?
positive;"<br /><br />10/10; a cool, fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact."
positive;Through 'Villons' prodding 'King Louis' will defeat his nemesis 'Duke of Burgandy' minimize the Feudal System and establish the KING as head of the State and the beginnings of modern France.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional, lead by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's GrandFather).
positive;Recommended viewing.<br /><br />One last thing: The opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history.
positive;Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema.
negative;"""Terror in the Aisles"" might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has, in fact, very few to offer."
negative;In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.<br /><br />As the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority.
negative;Wow, did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise!
positive;Anyway, back to this review: USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, whether it's through politics, protesting or arts or media.
positive;Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, though you never really like him for the scum that he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour enacts a perfect cad.
positive;Gooding does a nice job with the role, too.
positive;That wasn't the case.
negative;The thing that's truly terrifying about this is that the filmmakers thought they were making something intelligent and sexy.
positive;"""Railway Children"" is more than just a kid's film; it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing."
positive;"As Morris does, this extended roll pushes past the ""on"" moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime, their facade gives way to something real."
positive;"Right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too."
negative;This film was just on two nights running on ITV1.. dear oh dear.
positive;But Running out of TIme was great.<br /><br />i guess what made it so good was the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang, have such great chemistry.
negative;Well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that I can say about this film.
negative;<br /><br />Perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
negative;Very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face.
positive;It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.
positive;The film is not grounded in place or time, but rather in emotion.
positive;I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now.
positive;We can only pray that the BBC and Discovery Channel come up with even more outstanding ideas that could possibly even level with this one.
positive;I watch it with the girls every time.
positive;Shame represents a high point in the career of a master.
negative;"Now that I've seen ""Dr. Gore"" I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich."
positive;She is morality against power, somehow like Antigone.
negative;How they could call the series 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' after they deviated from the novels so much, I wouldn't have a clue.
positive;This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.<br /><br />It is well photographed and the sound is superb.
negative;The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout.
positive;And, written by a woman, Mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred, the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal.<br /><br />There's not the depth of Mockingbird here.
negative;It is terrible.
positive;quantifiable--and emotional.
negative;It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film.
negative;"However, they too chose to aim for younger audiences, but this time as a comedy (as did ""Bigfoot"" in 1995)."
negative;Far from erotic, even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes.<br /><br />Considering there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of available sex scenes are uncountable.
positive;There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times.
positive;I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema.
positive;It was truly brilliant.
positive;Or imagine if you're a Flea fan.
positive;It's the story of three brothers pulling together in the midst of hardship and loss, and learning that the really important things in life are family, love, trust, and forgiveness.
negative;One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably.
negative;"To show that she is mentally ill, she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she's ""going mad""."
negative;I remember that I really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best.
negative;"I know he's old but can't he get ""Hollywood"" to drop him a decent script or something?"
negative;No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role.
negative;Honestly, I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long, so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest.
negative;But in terms of being inspiring or uplifting it was as awful as it could be.
positive;The mammoths, when they finally arrive are fairly effective.
negative;Not like Disney i know!
positive;The movie is nicely atmospheric, with a creeping sense of tension and some strong suspense.
negative;But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God.
negative;somehow I doubt it<br /><br />The one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention, but so little care was given to everything in the film, I can't recommend it - Watch 'The Towering Inferno' instead<br /><br />3/10
negative;"<br /><br />Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.<br /><br />Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it."
negative;I'm sorry, but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture.
positive;"The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of ""Osterlich"" had me in stitches.<br /><br />This was a very good movie, and well worth watching."
negative;Such a dire threat!
positive;<br /><br />PLEASE RELEASE 'PORGY' ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive;The Good: 1.
positive;the other cars just seemed too much.
negative;"""<br /><br />And don't even get me started on a drunken Kirk and a grinning McCoy singing ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" together, like they were lovers in some sort of demented gay fever dream."
negative;They just keep on filming.
negative;He never was much of an actor, but here it is worse.He was definitely better in his earlier movies.
positive;Theresa Lee plays her comedic role well (Though much like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers.
positive;It turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big, substance-less light show for innocent kids and the self-medicated.
positive;"With Arquette's hugely successful NBC drama"" Medium"" bringing her to household name status, not to mention an Emmy win and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so."
positive;Jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father, but it did feel like the event occurred, the children were kept in the dark, and it suddenly resolved itself by the end.
negative;I'm sorry, but Flex just can't dance like Michael.
negative;Not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of English.
positive;She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location.
negative;I realized it had Chevy Chase in it with the same name he had in Caddyshack so I had an idea this was Caddyshack 2.
negative;Truly horrible.
positive;As a camera operator, I couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved.
positive;!...World War II did not just happen!!
positive;His new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants.
negative;"The Homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together, and things can return to normal...whatever that is.<br /><br />As for the cast, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially past their sell-by dates."
positive;or `Why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt?'
negative;Is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?!
positive;This is a great TV movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast.<br /><br />The only problem this movie has is that it hasn't stood the test of time as well as it might have.<br /><br />Despite this, it's definitely worth viewing, particularly if you are an Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon fan.
positive;It is a must see!
negative;The camera is no fan of his, he's not that attractive, and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very Cary Grant-like role.<br /><br />Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with Lombard's character.
positive;Reportedly, Peck hated this movie, but then this is not a spit-and-polish western in Technicolor.
positive;My favourite movie of all time.
negative;Does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard-living pilots flew secret missions in Laos in the 1970s?
positive;Where I find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but never seems to pursue any of them very far.
positive;In it, she tells of the hardships of making this film.
positive;Glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three-CD set with lots of extras.
negative;I do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen the light of day.
positive;"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord""."
positive;IT really portrays him as he really is.
negative;The same thing with other characters.
positive;By itself, the '56 version is a very well done film.
negative;They use only camera in hand.
positive;I would have liked him to be given more lines in the film, and have more character development.
negative;Great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through in art--it's just part of the game.
positive;What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy.
positive;Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster.
negative;And this is not just a Christan movie from an average Christian.
positive;This movie holds a special place in the hearts of the Class of '80.
positive;In the long run, it probably could have done without.
negative;Now that I'm a little older, I can say that although it's thoroughly average, I still consider it one of his better films.
negative;The story is that of any Buck Rogers 1930s serial.
positive;Random Hearts snuck up on me.
negative;But it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match.
negative;And the POWs do their best to help.
negative;"""The Exorcist""."
positive;In ordered to unite the warring, rival Princes in the Russian Realm, Nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils (The Teutonics).
negative;During production, this LWT series was titled 'Rocket To The Moon', a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough.
negative;This film nearly sapped all the life out of me and I have sat through some really bad movies.
negative;(As a note, I'd like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the entire youth group laughed at it.
negative;"In the literal sense....<br /><br />Reminds you of those ""cops-and-robber"" or cowboys-indians"" role-playing games you played with your 8 year old friends."
negative;"One guy (a scientist dude) says that life without flesh is death while another guy (a metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the ""death powder"" blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot; metamorphosing dude is visibly p!ssed off about the scientist dude's claim."
negative;:=8P
negative;It's the same thing as all of his other movies: Smoke past, CIA involvement and now trying to be a normal cop.
positive;I highly recommend this film.
negative;Whenever this comes on, I try to encourage my child to watch something else.
positive;Before each scene was finally shot, there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors, colors, dialog etc.
positive;Malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile.
positive;Instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the California desert in what evolves into a 'that's not fair.. i'm on that person's side'scenario.
negative;I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies.
negative;Come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!)
negative;No spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self- absorbed, self-pitying lowlife.
positive;<br /><br />Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose, the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen.
positive;But, as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk, it's just a simple matter of imagination.
positive;I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television).
negative;Pressure of Student Selection Exam (OSS) that 3-hour-exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration.
positive;It is at the top of the list, menace II society is second, and juice is third, Clockers is really stupid.<br /><br />The soundtrack for New Jersey Drive is Pwnage too Mac Mall & Young Lay - All about my fetti is heard through out the movie.<br /><br />Lords of the underground - Burn rubber, another good song, and so is Ill & Al Scratch - don't shut down on a player<br /><br />If your a fan of GTA-SA you'll freaking love this movie, AND The amazing soundtrack.
negative;"), the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that ""at least we're not that bad""¬Ö Cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father, Samuel L Jackson, fearful they will get off on some technicality, guns them down in cold blood before the trial."
positive;I would give it a 7/10.
positive;Too many film-makers these days substitute special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera-work in place of character-driven stories, but Director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and compelling.<br /><br />The story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the American Civil War.
positive;Its worth the price of the game by itself.
positive;I thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie.
negative;Peter Menzies lush, 50s Technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative.
negative;Suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face.
negative;"It may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts.<br /><br />As for ""tracing"" people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way."
negative;It's, in short, a waste of time.
negative;Then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a FUEL line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane.
negative;"Conversations like: ""You must follow the rules"" ""No, the people are starving."""
positive;The narration talks of a time before life, a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens.
negative;Until then, don't waste your time with this trash.
positive;The clothes (including Maggie Cheung's lovely dresses), the music (e.g.
positive;"However, this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who ""sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination"" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful.<br /><br />All this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (like in many of Miyazawa's stories).<br /><br />Some of the visuals are truly astounding, especially considering that it was a made for TV movie."
negative;Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department.
positive;Many actors have captured aspects of this character, but for me, it is always Derek Jacobi's performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short.
positive;"The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.<br /><br />Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Like the ""Police Academy"" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat."
positive;Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic.
negative;But this really sucked.
positive;What it lacks in the way of acting ability, it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit.<br /><br />The amazing thing about this movie, is that there was obviously some money that went into it.
negative;Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto did one of the Worst movies of All Time.
positive;A must-see episode!
positive;"This documentary does not need to be purchased; it can be watched for free on google video!"
negative;This film may be great, but it is a complete ripoff of Bill Forsythe's Comfort and Joy.
positive;'<br /><br />McEvoy's film unfolds in an unglamorous docu-drama style.
negative;How can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of India - a story like this writes itself.
negative;Obviously since Norma pushes the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own.
negative;"I will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice."
negative;Still they just can't save this ow so boring movie, i'm sorry.
negative;But, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times.
negative;And they picked up English from listening to our broadcasts.
positive;Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place.
positive;It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually.
negative;"""Manos, the Hands of Fate."""
positive;It is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by Warner or some other professional movie house.<br /><br />Copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies.<br /><br />As I understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its run, but only 15 are noted here.<br /><br />Some of the series writers, such as Richard Matheson, went on to become noted authors.<br /><br />Excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced.<br /><br />Michael Weldon,<br /><br />Udon Thani, Thailand
positive;Ultimately, the film fails to match the giddy heights of the TV series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments.
positive;Early Coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see (a pity).
positive;But few find it easy to forget.
negative;Sometimes so much that you can't make heads or tales as to what you are looking at.
positive;WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE ANOTHER MINISERIES THAT TIES INTO LONE D.
negative;The jokes involve rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile old people, swearing and racism.
negative;But unfortunatly,as good as the storyline is, its all ruined by Merle Haggard Narrating everything as you are watching it happen(for the love of God why did they do that?)
negative;While it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones Walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once Walker is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery.
negative;Melville is still spinning in his grave!
positive;"imagine the feeling of nostalgia surging in, singing ""here he comes, here comes speed racer!"
positive;Will some company PLEASE make a (good+) DVD of this film!???
negative;As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch.
positive;On the last season of Promised Land, did CBS show the whole last season??
positive;Both Torn and Cardinal are very believable in their roles.
positive;In all other ways, a true masterpiece of American cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).
negative;"""Constantine""), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la ""Manos The Hands of Fate"")."
negative;Instead, the narrator fills in a novella's worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters.<br /><br />There are good ideas in here, but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained.
positive;The movie is similar to The Black Circle Boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences.
positive;<br /><br />Vito gets information from Buddy and makes it look to Buddy that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates, Moon & Bo, to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom.<br /><br />Everything is going well for Vito & Co. until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the Seven Ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval,who was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off.

positive;The cinematography, performances, editing,music(by Philip Glass), and set designs, are really what make this worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-pic.<br /><br />One day I will pick, up a Mishima book, he does seem to have an ear for prose, and for staging ideas, but for now I'm satisfied with the film.<br /><br />Those interested in Japanese Literature, and post-war culture, should check out.
positive;His Irish brogue is not bad at all, and he seems always a natural man of the sea, very O'Neill-like in his independent, brooding nature.
positive;Some of the sexual-laced scenes disturbing.
negative;"Just ""I want you to build an ark."""
negative;You will be thinking, man the Conan movies were pretty cool...this one is totally boring and sucks.
positive;In the television/ movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part.
positive;Like heavyweight stuff, like Burtolucci and those guys.
positive;The mauseleum he's buried in plays host to the other main person, a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her & dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group.
positive;VERY bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled.
negative;Sounds amazing(sarcasm).
positive;"They emerge as very ""real"" characters ... credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times."
negative;(Yes I understand the constraints of the film's budget.
positive;And, because the job was bungled so badly, the mob boss (Ed MacMahon!!)
positive;"This telecast of the classic musical ""Sweeney Todd"" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.<br /><br />Firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor."
positive;However, the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has, as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs, it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments.
positive;I'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.<br /><br />However major highlights included the HUGE pop for Demolition winning the tag team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, The first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan.<br /><br />Some matches were a complete waste of time.
negative;The evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is.
positive;Every wobbly shot a work of art(?).
negative;I'm sure that was what Corman was thinking, when he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheaply as possible.
negative;But it is embarrassing and infuriating when Canadian producers (in this case, CanWest Global) do it with help from the federal and provincial governments.
positive;He is a truly gifted actor and I wouldn't hesitate to see him in anything, because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul.
positive;"It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film ""Until Death"" had no martial arts in it at all!!"
positive;But I never forgot.
positive;I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war.
positive;"The mother personifies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist/fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, let's say, √ºbermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown.<br /><br />""La Pianiste"" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love."
negative;"At least ""The Cassandra Crossing"" had a better cast, an engaging storyline, and real train scenes.<br /><br />If you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a ""B movie"" party then watch this; otherwise, ""Alien Express"" derailed long before departing from the station!"
positive;It plugged up the pass, just like a cork in a bottle.
positive;Maybe it's tied up in court on some legal issue, but a truly riotous hospital farce with Sellers as crooked administrator.
positive;I do have to admit that I have never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski but she grew on me in this movie.
positive;The children are beautiful, take special note of the young man who plays Sipho.
positive;Not as depressing as it could have been, this is kitchen-sink at its most dirty.
positive;and thats only a taste of what it has to offer!
positive;He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage.
positive;For me, the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right.<br /><br />The interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods.
negative;<br /><br />4.
negative;i was looking forward to this, and to be honest there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world.
positive;"Her main battle is with her leading man (""an actor is really a woman"" she opines), although, naturally, it is the leading lady who will steal the show."
negative;The story has the Japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped into the Manila bay.<br /><br />It's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle montage).
negative;The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this film.
negative;There is also some dubbing problems where it's clear the sounds of their voices often don't match the movements of their lips..particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where Ed(Travis Parker), wannabe rock star, is singing to his buddies a horrible song they all seem quite impressed with.
positive;It was not disclosed in the Q & A, but I imagine Hollywood could take a lesson in budget film-making by learning from this director.
negative;It's when Larry goes back to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things begin to really heat up, emotional and sexually.
negative;This is Shatner on mushrooms -- or maybe peyote.
positive;"So, strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, leaving him acting sort of like Steve Martin in ""All of Me"".<br /><br />Yes, the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense."
negative;The prologue of this film features a very well-written scene, establishing Tom Tulliver as wilful and bully-ragging from an early age, and young Philip Wakeham as decent and thoughtful.
positive;Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock.
negative;Then word came through that it had been retitled 'Reach for the Moon', as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters.
positive;Raoul Walsh's mega-epic, stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in the early talkie manner, but this classic wagon train journey across America to the NorthWest is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen.
positive;That shot of McQueen's Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman's rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact.
negative;If there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be of a certain culture, they should've used an actor that was of that culture.
negative;I've never saw the first three, but I know they're all better than this...trash.
positive;Seven and a half stars out of ten.
positive;Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life.
negative;whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know.
positive;The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies.
positive;Mikhail Kalatozov's The Cranes are flying is a superb film.
positive;This is a movie that should be a Classic Romance known as well as my other favorite, Somewhere in Time.
positive;I own this movie, and everyone that I've shared it with, loves it.
positive;It handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems.
negative;You don't scare it is full of American teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily.<br /><br />But it tells much about a senior student in a Turkish High-School.
positive;He makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive.
positive;Entertaining and fun, this is a hour and a half of easy watching.
negative;The film is bad.
positive;I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) & Richie (Mayall).
positive;This movie's plot is all too ridiculous, but imagine it taken out of context: *boy arm wrestling an over aggressive Meat Loaf, who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into Guns N Roses, looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from Voyager enter the bar* Can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that?
negative;"If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you go rent ""Shaolin Temple 2"" (aka Kids from Shaolin)."
positive;The orchestra that entertains in a public park every Sunday doesn't get the attention it deserves.
positive;Although this movie was released in 1970, it's message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to undergo major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively dramatizes.
negative;It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life.
positive;Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker.
positive;Hungarian chef S.Z.
negative;The man can't act in this one, sorry.<br /><br />Although I can't say if I would find the movie funny now...(we were blown when we watched it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day...but nothing else.
negative;The disdain shown for Flynn in this movie is palpable.
negative;My family and I just waisted 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish !!!
negative;This film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the Regency period.
negative;Now that's a plot!
positive;This movie will inspire discussion and, despite the countless times I've seen it, still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers.
positive;Like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water, and it goes quite, you're like the croc's about to attack.
positive;"The working title for the film was originally ""Power"", and you'll see why."
negative;Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.<br /><br />It had potential.
positive;Is that Drew Barrymore?
negative;Perhaps the worst is lead character Carrie Bradshaw.
positive;Plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire-arms and knock out the bad guys, etc.
negative;Watch if you want.
positive;The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world which most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream, why not dream a little?
negative;One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it...<br /><br />This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful.
negative;I mean, if you want it to be gruesome and I mean, so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that... you need more than 2 sequences..
positive;With regard to the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie Ray Charles.
negative;It is said that there are some people out there who actually ADMIRE Monogram's movies.
negative;Byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.<br /><br />The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife?
negative;He cries like a woman because he is SCARED of her.
positive;This film is a good start for novices that have never watched a 'Silent Film' and for those who believe that quality Cinema started with their generations efforts.
negative;"After a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the ""villains"" of the film appeared."
positive;Dominic Armato's voice is perfect for Guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive.
negative;Etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />The second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario.
negative;Most of the indigenous audience laughed, and no, this wasn't in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children, this was in a well-to-do area, and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults.<br /><br />So it must be possible, somehow, to find this amusing, but honest to goodness, I have no idea what it takes---maybe it's in the air or the water, prolonged exposure to which causes this condition.
positive;Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage.
negative;But the final product, leave a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />P.S.
negative;That was funny.
negative;"SO when I finally got to it, I was like ""Who the hell is this dude?""."
positive;"<br /><br />John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing."
positive;The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life, adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics.
negative;Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.<br /><br />It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film.
negative;And a heist with $42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie.<br /><br />Big disappointment - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy.<br /><br />But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong.
positive;Eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, yet there's also some mysterious quality attached to his character.
positive;It is these origins, the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse that Herzog is concerned with, as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time.<br /><br />Watching FM I couldn't help but feel I was a passenger on a profound journey.
negative;While Watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard TV movie... though through out the picture the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot) are by the book and unoriginal... and with every one the movie KEPT GETTING WORSE!<br /><br />Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner on the hit TV show Full House, is not very convincing as a Possessed twenty something.. trying to avenge the Possesers Death.
negative;The Creepy Janitor: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant.
positive;I loved this film.
positive;"""), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well-drawn."
positive;"My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Ray"""
positive;"I agree with ""johnlewis"", who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film."
positive;The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average.
negative;In my opinion, when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldn't have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would enable the viewer to discern the truth himself.
positive;"Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, ""Now it's goulash"", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch."
negative;Turturro's performance is lackluster, and most of the comedy is overplayed.
positive;Little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money.
positive;Of course, he is thought to be quite mad.
negative;"maintain 230 heading""<br /><br />Bocelli: ""What?"
positive;But why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well?
positive;Seriously awesome music.<br /><br />Just go see it, its a must for anyone who loves rock!
positive;""".<br /><br />Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation Street' villain Mark Eden ( he was the psychotic Alan Bradley ) as 'Spencer', Michael Stainton as 'Buxton', and 'Doctor At Sea''s Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely 'Cathy Strong'."
negative;If you watch those cars you'll see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus.
positive;It's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes.
positive;As he presumably decapitates the unfortunate heroine, we come across Michael and his girl in the movie theatre, actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture.
positive;Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh.
positive;Needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death.
positive;The best that Miguel Bardem has ever made.
negative;Didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly?
negative;"""Lifetime"" movies have a few repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous.<br /><br />The ""Spouse..."" category can have a spouse of long-standing, but some person appears, or an event occurs, exposing that the good wife was once a hooker, one of the couple was involved in some nefarious act long ago, or that something else in one of the background in different than presumed -- etc., etc., or, as in this flick, one of them has entered the marriage with the most nefarious of aims.<br /><br />One constant, in all of their genres is that the husband or other males are usually clueless, vacuous, and slow to have any idea what in the hell is going until the climax, or at best, very late in the proceedings (unless the male is the miscreant)."
negative;Why do I acknowledge its existence?
positive;<br /><br />Leader of the gang is Gene Reynolds who at one time played the violin, but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins.
positive;The Action: This is a very action packed movie.
negative;They never speak or interact in any meaningful way ¬ñ they just stand there looking at each other, and occasionally crying.
positive;The overall story is too thin.
negative;this mock serial killer thriller was a weak, puny attempt at an even B film.
positive;And coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else...their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have.<br /><br />Then I got older, studied film a bit... and watched this film again with my best friend from High School.
negative;Those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ...bla bla bla) and I fail to understand why many people love the concept.
positive;BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades.
negative;(1) Your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e.
negative;This film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen The Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
negative;They fly under impossibly hazardous conditions.
negative;"When he ""respectfully refuses"" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat, cheering, and swearing as if they were at a football game."
negative;His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing.
negative;Just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual, like porn.
positive;(This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.)
negative;This is the worst movie I've ever seen.
negative;I'll give it some faint praise for the gore--if you can wade through the padding in between kills, the red vino is definitely a thing of wonder, and the only real reason to watch this.
negative;<br /><br />I would suggest the movie if you like John's music but not as a Saturday night video.
positive;Time travel into the past is tenuous at best as a topic.
positive;If you want nonstop laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters, and catchphrases to last a lifetime, watch this.
negative;I normally don't have a problem with SOV movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful.
positive;i L-O-V-E this movie... everyone and their grandmother's sister's lawyer's dentist needs to own it!
negative;So from the promising start you became increasingly disappointed as the non-story went along.
negative;His performance here belongs in a better film: it made me want to see 'Wuthering Heights' recast with Mason as Heathcliff.<br /><br />As this is a multi-generational saga (something which George Eliot did much better in 'Middlemarch'), several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors apiece: child actors in the prologue, adults in the main narrative.
positive;In this day and age of Gay rights being questioned, I think this movie should be seen by all.
negative;I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary.
negative;It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie.
negative;maybe Hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director.sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad.<br /><br />If i had to re-watch it it would be like torture.
positive;And, like those shows, if you're a little kid, I mean little as in younger than I was watching the show, you may not understand most of the jokes (i.e.
negative;I was so glad that I have FF button on my remote, 32x worked really well.
negative;It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist.
negative;Women of the Regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public.
positive;When hearing that Pacino plays a Jew one might think that it would not work looking at Pacino's previous mobster type movie roles.
positive;He rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole.
negative;It's 1/2 film, 1/2 sony hand-cam.
positive;"The show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth; partying and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the clubs."
negative;In real life, MJ was white as hell.
positive;The audience laughed, cried, and erupted in applause for the film and its director.
negative;A different edit might have made an interesting documentary of this, but I doubt it, the interviews shown were not engaging in any way.
positive;The Jackal's former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married Quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her, alone is worth the price of admission.
positive;<br /><br />However, the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors.
negative;well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end, but it didn't make sense..<br /><br />there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story, which made it more boring.
positive;I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie.
negative;Plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks.
positive;Through clever planning and influence, Frank is able to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell).<br /><br />From thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase.
negative;The acting was just horrid and forced.
positive;I loved this movie and I watch it everyday.
negative;For the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot.
positive;Everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!!
positive;Playin songs great songs from The Who, Dio, and others just complete it.
positive;Johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the Clegg boys ride along side them a piece.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.
positive;Take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was!
positive;Though Paul Anthony handles his role well, casting a very young teenager in the pivotal main role would have made the story work much better, and Richard Bell, with only one other film 'Two Brothers' on his resume, gives promise of a young talent to watch.
negative;It was more reminiscent of a drama, like A MAN CALLED HORSE, which I liked better.
positive;and authentic .with great Dialogue.
positive;So i bought the video.
positive;The result is clear, people all over the park flocks to hear the talented young singers, thus ensuring the orchestra's existence.<br /><br />Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing by the two stars who are wonderful in their rendition.
positive;Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour.
negative;This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and...
negative;End of story, in which the rest of the characters wander off and leave their dead comrade laying on the ground to rot.
negative;Really...
positive;I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies.
negative;Find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it.
positive;She makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that fit well into the story being told.
negative;I'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his Mother, and girlfriend as filler, and far too much of it.<br /><br />I guess what I'm wondering is this... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein?
negative;In particular, the actress playing a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto.<br /><br />In fact, very few of the actors were wooden.
negative;"Fred Astaire is reteamed with Rita Hayworth one year after their big hit for Columbia, ""You'll Never Get Rich""."
negative;I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy.
positive;This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.
negative;Don't bother with it.
positive;I didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55.
negative;The acting was borderline absurd which I blame on the script and screenplay.
negative;I am PROFOUND!!'
positive;If he can do that, I'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years.
negative;Plus, it's VERY hard to make it through the entire film.
negative;"The use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching."
negative;For the main character to decide to get a cop killed, and kill his friends and co-workers after the homeless guy was already dead, it's just ridiculous.
positive;The female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent.
positive;As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now.
negative;You'll find no interesting female characters in this epic.
negative;"And about 4x in a row!<br /><br />And then there is the ""butterfly death"" that would set the whole ""evolution changes"" in to progress."
positive;I was never fond of his early work but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he is on a roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominated BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how Bardem has now become a real reference for Spanish cinema in the whole world.
negative;Horrible and embarrassing.
positive;I will say that this film has some of the best effects I've seen in an indie horror film but the subject matter will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most (not me though--I live for this!
negative;In fact, the variation in quality of Lost has been so inconsistent, I find myself often wondering how many writers they are using.<br /><br />I will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope I stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die off.
negative;I really can't recommend it to anyone, not even for unintentional laughs.
negative;The only thing I liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere.<br /><br />Even worse where the cars, in one scene 2 characters walk along the street.
positive;A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.<br /><br />Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence.
positive;I thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that I've ever seen.
positive;Peggy Oki.
negative;It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.<br /><br />Production values: almost passable.
negative;"Moronic Female FBI Agent: ""Yeah, sounds a-okay to me."
negative;Come on---if you think Walker is a heartfelt show without bias, then explain why JT is treated as a dolt, always is the subject of Walker's jokes, never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues Walker, who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does.
negative;while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before.
negative;"For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi, was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book."
negative;Other than Marissa Coughlin's delightful Exorcist rendition, Mirren is the only reason to see this movie.
positive;Finally, it is very funny from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timeouts, great FX, a great cast, great landscapes, great everything !!
negative;"Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; you guys need not fear as none other than Andy Milligan is ¬ñ hands down ¬ñ the worst director ever, but I don't think he cared."
negative;Nolte's character (a sergeant) has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed.
positive;Besides, these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible.
negative;Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where unsurprisingly he killed a lot of people.
positive;This could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller, or depressing white trash drama, but it stayed a course all its own till the end.
negative;Who couldn't do that?
positive;I purchased this DVD recently and I was totally awed that Rush's songs sound the same as they did when I first listened to them in 1980.
negative;But on the other hand, I can't resist a good bashing.
negative;Cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him.
negative;<br /><br />Then you have the obvious....a Loud, gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience.
negative;Where did she go?
positive;Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.
negative;For me the film seems to have half a real plot, the retrieval of the silver, and half a plot that is there just to fill time.
negative;The town only has one pilot who is not often available.
negative;"Trust me, there is nothing ""erotic"" about this film."
negative;"For example, one of the characters discovers a book called ""Groins of the Darker Species."""
negative;The scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual.
positive;This is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account.
negative;I couldn't recommend this to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone who has a Jones for Asian porn.
positive;Improbable--perhaps implausible.
positive;I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it, and relating it to reality.
negative;"Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, ""Graduation Day""!"
negative;The female lead is dismissible, as is usual with Monogram, but the male leads are definitely up there on the B List.
positive;Various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at 'vote stuffing' by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it....The exact methods we use will not be disclosed.
negative;"He prays ""Divinity"" will restore his fianc√©e, whom he believes was changed into a dragon, 1,000 years ago."
negative;This was a flick doomed from its conception.
negative;There are movies like Vampire vs. Zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad, no point to making such movies.
positive;"It is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while, but once again, this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny."
negative;Others, maybe a couple.<br /><br />Then there's Linda Blair.
positive;Can't forget when Eddie is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate....
negative;These films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and overall tone.
positive;This is a duel of acting titans, each not giving the other a inch.
negative;It was a real amateur attempt.
positive;I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e.
positive;This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time.
negative;There's not really much point in describing the plot in detail.
positive;James' devastation is just the beginning in this well-crafted drama.
negative;They do not succeed.<br /><br />The special effects aren't very special.
negative;"Rourke does his usual bit part,as a sinister,rancorous,Neanderthalian,ferocious,evil jerk,in the same mold as in ""Picture Claire"",""Out in Fifty"",""Get Carter"",""Double Team"" and the rest of the garbage he happens to be in.<br /><br />He has very few lines.<br /><br />Of course,all this is just junk,undervaluing Rourke,abasing him,and doesn't matter for his characterization as an actor.Still ,after seeing ""A Prayer ..."",""Johnny Handsome"",""Barfly"",""9 1/2 Weeks"",""Year of the Dragon"",etc.,etc.,for many years I considered Rourke an outstanding,smart,intelligent man.I think he has changed since.<br /><br />He looks callous,calcined.<br /><br />""He went about with gloomy looks;/Despair inhabited his breast/And made the man a perfect pest."
positive;"<br /><br />The movie ""The Seven Ups"" has the late Bill Hickman doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film."
negative;"By now, practically every British comedian has done a ""trouble at t' mill, squire"" comedy routine, parodying precisely this subject matter, so I had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face.<br /><br />The character actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credits (in that Old English typeface) misspell her forename as 'Marita'."
positive;Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could.
negative;"When Hoffman whines about being ""tortured"" by the endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out!"
positive;This is the film's weakest segment and it has a bunch of nude people f!cking bloody holes in a field and whatnot.
negative;Where'd you get those nifty Rocket Shoes, Spock?
positive;Perfect for just sitting around alone and watching at like 3AM with just you and a bottle.
negative;No need for a bulldozer here!
positive;"My original expectations of ""Black Water"" was that it was a crappily made, acted, directed, paced, and boring movie."
positive;I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I wasn't happy.
positive;As Slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party, along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire!
positive;White Bull is demonised by both Pike and the abductee as a 'bastard', unwittingly revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by colonising whites who infantilised the natives, becoming themselves 'necessary' fathers.<br /><br />Unlike a traditional Western, concerned with making history, civilisation, and progress, this film is a double detective story, interrogating the past, tracks, remains.<br /><br />What gives this film its remarkable uniqueness, I think, is, despite Maltin's racism, its Britishness.
negative;Story is almost ok in all of it's stupidness.
negative;Great, now that we are going to destroy something, let's go all the way.<br /><br />I knew that it would probably be bad before I went.
negative;All of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults.
negative;Tora!
negative;"(Note to Mencia: Please do not do a ""Block Party"" movie."
negative;Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie.
positive;Make no mistake about it: In the Mood for Love was the most gorgeous film of 2001.
positive;Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot?
negative;It is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it.
negative;I have to say that this movie was really quite awful.
negative;Otherwise the two are incomparable.<br /><br />Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead, so they decide to rip off their boss and make for Rio.
negative;I never saw something like that.
negative;"""Catchfire"" or ""Backtrack"" as it is sometimes called, is not very good."
negative;It doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what Trekkies hate the most.
negative;The plot sounded great, about a half-human, half-leopard creature in Africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young American adults.
positive;Certainly the dunes look like a female body, but the simile cuts both ways.
positive;Suspension of disbelief comes easily, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did.
negative;Local Has a young Peter Capaldi, and an old Burt Lancaster.<br /><br />Unfortunately he's given up film-making after some really crappy Hollywood treatment.
negative;"<br /><br />NO she ain't ""the cutest thing."""
negative;The husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife... a love of friendship, but not close tenderness.<br /><br />A mixed movie for sure.
positive;Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie... we love you!
positive;Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films, and her entrance is still classic.
negative;"Dryly irreverent, but sadly unfunny satire of detective movies, with stony-faced Michael Caine playing a British author of trashy crime stories traveling to the Mediterraean to assist in writing the memoirs of a would-be gangster; soon, he realizes he's being followed and his life is in danger."
negative;Like most thrillers The Hitchhiker had promise yet failed to deliver when it had me bright eyed and ready to turn the volume down(I was watching the movie alone.. in the dark) This so called thriller simply came apart like it was made of Lego transforming into something else.
positive;During World War II, two Byelorussian (Soviet Russian) soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying Nazis, as they trudge through snowy terrain, searching for food and safety.
negative;WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die?
negative;Sort of fun :) Well I guess I could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it.
negative;This movie is complete garbage!!!
positive;The music is beautiful.
negative;I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo's presentations, but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a D+.
negative;The bad depiction of Shakespeare's characters, and the terrible rendition of the love that Desi & John had, made this movie the horrendous filth that it is.
negative;"I'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films; ""At least it wasn't as bad as Caro Diario."""
negative;"dont waste your time unless you are a hardcore NIN ""fan"""
positive;"I suppose ""Border Patrol"" just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word ""Shepherd"" in front of it!!"
negative;So when Bud shows up one day, he proves he can play as a receiver for them, and is no doubt the team's best player.<br /><br />Buddy's extremely cute in his football costume.
positive;You are taken in fully with the butchers non-life - particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business.
positive;I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam.
positive;The music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the American Censorship Committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time Gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles.
positive;"I highly recommend you see this film, ""The Art Of Am√°lia Rodrigues"".<br /><br />"
negative;A must miss.
positive;Wish Sony would hurry up and do the same with the film.
negative;Carrie looked ugly, Mr. Big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha didn't say f***.
positive;It has no swearing, bits of romance (if your old enough to figure it out) and beautifully written storyline.
negative;Lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about DEEP RIVER that could make it a horror film, but even that doesn't execute well.<br /><br />THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre, but as an entry in the genre, is easily eclipsed by Deodato's entries and even Lenzi's own later entries.
negative;I hope this review stops one person from watching this investigative trash in the future.
positive;In the end, all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie uncovered.<br /><br />Brilliant film.
negative;Of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands.
negative;Yes, that was not a typo.
negative;We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging.
negative;"Ray movies excell in.<br /><br />The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry, in which the director makes comments like ""We had a limited budget"" and ""with our limited timeline"" which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film."
negative;But then there comes a homosexual, policeman...
positive;Robert Duvall's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition.
positive;Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case.
negative;The movie likewise, shies away from anything that could make it good.
negative;Any intelligent woman would never envy them.
negative;Oooohhh...scary!
negative;This movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can't help staring at the car wreck when you drive by.
positive;"The ""My Plague"" video was shot there and is included on the DVD."
positive;The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are side-splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious.
negative;There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more.
positive;"A stage actor still waiting for his big break, Harry brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but just didn't know it until he met Harry).<br /><br />With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... Those Lips, Those Eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that, for 2 hours, take us to a fantasy land, but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long!<br /><br />Like Artie ... once you've seen Those Lips, Those Eyes ... ""You're hooked, kid!"""
positive;That's about the only big difference from the real story, and the information that remains is, as I've stated, very true to the facts.
positive;If we could re-live our youthful experiences, if we could really remember the events that shaped us, wouldn't we find a special kind of freedom?
positive;!<br /><br />The reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way, once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world overall, tragedy from WWII was recognized, and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride, and dealt with accordingly!!
positive;Although many of the posters here have picked up upon the theme of defying death.. few seem to have touched upon what I see as the main premise of the movie - the importance of forgiveness, and the need to be cognizant of all you do, because it does `matter.
negative;It's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film.
positive;This time<br /><br />Columbo goes to college, and actually explains his entire technique, but for some reason the murderer still doesn't pay enough attention.
positive;So girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls!
negative;The plot and acting of This movie was terrible.
negative;Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here it was made around 1987.
negative;Most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th-century England.
positive;A lovely performance from Anne Parillaud as Breillat wrestling with her own script, looking ten years younger than her age.
negative;I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favourite actresses, Tom Courtney can act well when pushed and David Suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all wallowed around like fish in a barrel of watery gin.
positive;Incredible car chase that started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of New Jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with Buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts.
negative;<br /><br />I guess we`re not suppossed to think about such details since A PYROMANIAC`S LOVE STORY isn`t suppossed to be an intelligent thriller , it`s a light hearted romantic comedy/ chick flick that`s probably best apprieciated as a girls night in .
positive;But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck.
negative;This movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the North americian falangist party - or some similar group...
positive;Who is the bum behind Winkies?
negative;I'm watching a movie here, it would be nice to be able to see.<br /><br />Then there is the ending.
positive;"""Tommy Boy"" is one of the 1990's best comedies."
negative;It is just plain bad.
negative;Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work.
positive;"""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls""."
negative;Tyrone power!
positive;Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen.
negative;Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ?
positive;Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine.
positive;While obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time, Strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story.
negative;Even if they believe than they can do it, they cant.
positive;She was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son.
positive;Thats why I am giving it a ten out of ten!
positive;I think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half.
negative;These are not quick but rather several seconds long.
negative;If you're going to rob an armored car, and there's a homeless person which sees you, you have to do, what you have to do.
negative;Well, after much exposition, and some throttling, the 2 monsters throttle each other for a bit, Tania stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - only to have him throttle her!
positive;Parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case the subject of the documentary went above and beyond.
negative;"The only thespian missing to top this turd was Gary Coleman, who if he would have been in the movie, would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad, rather than just plain bad.<br /><br />There was one part in the film where Carol Alt screamed, ""DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?!?"""
negative;In other words, an Andy Milligan premise at his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateurish.
negative;I only saw this flick for curiosity, and this is truly a shame...
negative;This is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved.
positive;I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters.
positive;Trisha,Ashish Vidyarthi,the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently.
negative;What's wrong with it?
positive;Criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an IA cop and a Congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film felt just fine to me , and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing.
positive;It's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo.Sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane!
negative;The credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I've read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process.
positive;no actor before or since has captured my interests in a movie since.
negative;Etc., etc.
positive;The characters are brilliant, the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering.
positive;The original release, however, has several very brief extras, including clips of the making of the sequels, a preview of The Animatrix and Yuen Wo Ping's Blocking Tapes(a complete run-through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences, with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort).
positive;Having seen Jacobi's Hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family.
negative;There isn't plot, no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film.
positive;The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters.
positive;Chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch.
positive;I lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back.
positive;"The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.<br /><br />As good as Chaplin is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of ""Bacteria"" - ""Benzino Napaloni."""
positive;This was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so.
positive;The character animation is as excellent as one would expect, showing a variety of emotions well.<br /><br />Smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes (an escape from the path of a speeding train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly.
negative;A group of shaggy drunken CIA pilots are sitting around in a cat house, goosing the girls, shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol, killing lizards with same.
negative;- The acting is an insult to humanity.
positive;Oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time!
positive;I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing.
positive;As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety.
negative;Taken out of context, if one did not know Brooks' work before viewing, the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on.
negative;Franklin, Franklin was just scary.
positive;"""Island of the Fishmen"" delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera-work."
positive;"Oh, the ""whodunnit"" is different, but the underlying story, a lone righteous ""white"" attorney against a white Southern town defending a Black man is all too familiar."
negative;Nothing justify it.<br /><br />I recommend that you don't even think to see this movie.
negative;I mean I know its sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible, and this is too implausible.
negative;I'm not exaggerating.<br /><br />Don't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie.
positive;I agree with all prior positive reviews.
negative;The second time I laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of Michael but they had Flex's face instead!
positive;It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again ¬ñ they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time.
negative;What we end up with though, is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's SciFi C-movie.
negative;And I completely blew it with my high expectations.
positive;are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film.
positive;Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return.
negative;Overall however, the film is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere.
negative;Though it pains me to some degree that I'm bothering to christen the comments board for this new series - mainly because I'd hate to give the false impression that there's actually any semblance of public interest in it - I feel compelled to throw in my chips on this one.<br /><br />To put it simply, never before have I felt so persuaded to root for a TV show's swift and merciless cancellation based solely on the merit of its promo ads.
negative;<br /><br />In conclusion, this film was by far, the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind.
negative;I'll overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox that's performed on-screen.
positive;It certainly makes me look forward to Friday nights and I'm glad I now own the first two seasons on DVD!
negative;"I was a devout Catholic before this ""film""."
negative;I wonder how IMDb has given some recommendations to this movie.
positive;How often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others.
positive;The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth.
negative;I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already been and loved it.
positive;It has some very gory pieces in the film, but not bad enough to make you sick.
negative;At one point, one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well, something that hadn't happened yet.
negative;It has its successes (acting, make-up), but those don't change the fact that it's not very entertaining at all.
positive;Get by all that and you have a film that shows up intriguing possibilities.
positive;Love that.
positive;Some films just fade away, but Tourist Trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite.
negative;1989 was already a year in where Eddie Murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten.
positive;<br /><br />The signature scenes include:<br /><br />1/ the look of Bugs Bunny's home, cross-referencing to Donald Duck with the B.B.
negative;He didn't seem to care, and so neither did I. I actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point.<br /><br />The dog was not a character in the film.
positive;I just totally loved it!
negative;).<br /><br />One note of warning, though, the writer seemed to really like jokes about the, um, male lower regions.
positive;"What he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to ""make do""."
negative;The wicked Amelia tries to have the dead spirit of Erica take over Carol's body and end up murdering Larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband Hal's injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair.<br /><br />Not much of a story but lot's of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry getting manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her.
negative;*1/2 from ****
positive;<br /><br />
positive;"Or if you've seen the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and/or ""Bubba Ho-Tep"", then you should know that his movies are total farces."
positive;I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert.
negative;Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine.
negative;If you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at (aka 'bot fodder), go for it.
positive;This movie is pure escapism.
positive;"""42nd St."" is centered around Julian Marsh, a great director of Broadway shows, which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement."
negative;The storyline is rather dumb, far from the precise cleverness of the BD, and obviously aimed at an international audience.
negative;Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.<br /><br />Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI.
negative;Every time you think it can't get any more filthy, it does.
negative;Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention.
negative;On top of all this, the show portrays men as a bunch of empty headed slobs who are unable to commit to healthy relationships.
negative;But there's not enough of the Herzog scenes to merit their place in the film, and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is, in retrospect, tedious.<br /><br />This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy that suffers mostly, at least in the lookalike segments, from having far too many characters for the film's running length, a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone (as was originally planned).<br /><br />With many of the imagery's self-contained beauty, and moments of real, genuine connection with the soundtrack, this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition.
positive;I think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress Drew Barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something I never imagined her being.
positive;I am your friend always,/ Sharon
negative;Regrettably, none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue.<br /><br />The climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm, much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes.
negative;The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent but also has no feel for Austen's style.
negative;He kills RAFE in the creepy church, confronts VIVIAN, and she saves him from the others wolves, except AIDEN shoots her, so they saunter off to find medicine, and then they try to leave the city together.
positive;All in all this is a rise above other B-movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script defficiencies, its certainly worth a rent.
negative;"Four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly, it stars Carly Pope (of ""Popular"" fame), who is always a pleasure to watch."
negative;"Who knows...<br /><br />If you think the promised eye-candy will save the film, you're in for a disappointment--the so-called ""babes"" are manish and downright ugly."
negative;What is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it?
negative;"Despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region, Les Baux and the area around it stands in for almost everything.<br /><br />David Birney makes for a spectacularly colourless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at one point ""you're a walking clich√©""."
positive;Words can hardly describe what Blue Planet brought to life in all of its hours of runtime.
positive;Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters own journeys towards self-understanding, as they too come to realize that everyone has value, and `everything we do matters.
negative;Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh.
negative;This movie is just plain and simply terrible.
negative;"she tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin) but failed to impress.<br /><br />music wasn't that impressive as well, only one song ""Jhalak Dikhlajaa"" was worth listening to..... <br /><br />Aksar, the title ?"
positive;It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way.
positive;"Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known ""lefties"", but the accident at Three Mle Island provided shocking context to this fictional drama.<br /><br />This film works on many levels, taking shots at both public utilities and TV news."
negative;"I would rather sit through the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" marathon than watch another minute of this vomit."
negative;"With movies like ""Elf"" and ""Brother Bear"" currently in theaters, you have far better choices."
positive;Reed Hadley's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel, reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript.
positive;The actor chosen for this historic film is none other than America's own James Stewart who convincingly plays Charles Lindbergh.
negative;The way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull-psychology-self-help book.
negative;"Incredibly, ""Vampire Assassin"" is significantly worse than such atrocities as ""Tequila Body Shots"" and ""Zombie Nation"" - and those movies are TERRIBLE."
negative;I wanted to walk out of the theater because of those horrible special effects.
positive;Meredith Eaton steals just about every scene that she is in.
positive;But the infamous Troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end.
positive;what a great actress so yeah i recommend everybody this great movie
negative;both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder.
negative;Where's the fun?
negative;What is this?
negative;Actually I was just on the sight looking for the name of the star of the film and then I started reading reviews...
negative;"<br /><br />;=8)"
negative;Deep Blue didn't take the bait, and Kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played Deep Blue to a draw and ended up resigning.
positive;But I have seen that movie many times since I was a kid.
positive;How true those words are!
negative;Yes, it's an incredibly stupid film, but surely you have struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low-budget garbage.
positive;It meandered, but did feel like a slice of life.
negative;This is a pretty simplistic romance.
positive;Simply put, you'll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again!
positive;Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together.
negative;"Woody Allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: ""She said I was great in bed."
negative;It's not quite a glorified killing, though Aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way, as though it makes an attractive painting, and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom, neither materially nor emotionally.
positive;She is waiting for the book that it is based on.
positive;"Finally, as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts, although credit must go to Belden for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end.<br /><br />One could say that Charles Belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre, as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the B movie studios nicknamed as ""the Poverty Row"", ""The Ghost Walks"" is easily among the best (alongisde Strayer's previous film, ""The Vmapire Bat"") despite its shortcomings."
negative;Instead it's all over the place.
positive;Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art.
positive;with this movie, those amazing people at troma offer you a whole new perspective into the story of romeo and juliet in ways you never would have thought to be possible!
negative;Keira Knightly is a pretty Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern.
negative;It always looks like he's overacting.
positive;Those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film.
positive;While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e.
positive;(There is a graphic of the territory with the Flinthead Mountains stretching across the screen with a bottleneck pass.)
negative;It is only when she gets to the cursed land that she begins to realise that her father is still alive and that the beast may not even be that evil after all.
negative;the old deathmatch is way better.
positive;Truly delighted with myself now !!
negative;Are they saying all Puerto Ricans are aliens?
negative;This is very much overrated.
negative;Robert Forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a killing spree in the desert.
negative;I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago, but was unable to finish it.
negative;"""Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver"" is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year."
negative;Ahh,the smell of roasting chicken..err.. alien.
negative;Not just that song, but a couple more were really funny, and are classics as far as I'm concerned.
positive;Great acting, well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series.
negative;It's not,fantastic,surrealistic or horror,It's just hideously bad Turkish feature film.And finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters.
positive;I am salivating for the sequels.
negative;The only reason I didn't turn the movie off was because I have gotten wrapped up in creating an account on IMDb and posting this review.
negative;A whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor.
positive;You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography.
positive;"I just watched ""return from lonesome dove"" and it was very good!"
negative;God just pops up in between scenes to tell Evan to build the ark.
positive;When I saw this film, it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half-aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it, I myself had not slept in three days.
positive;At some point in all of these I feel like I want to take a shower.
positive;Not because of what happens to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path.<br /><br />The plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater, but the pacing could use some tightening up.
negative;Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category.
negative;Sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch, but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind.
negative;No words can describe how awful this film is.
negative;Or could it be boyfriend's daughter, who goes blabbing everyone's secrets at school, causing untold misery?
positive;All other voice talents fit their characters perfectly, especially Earl Boen who is the voice behind LeChuck.
negative;<br /><br />*sigh* I was really looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that it didn't follow it one bit.
negative;the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography.i found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the clich√© lines did nothing for me.
positive;I definitely recommend it!
negative;Not even grainy video of a chair moving, or a black blob running between prison cells.
positive;"""Well, that's just it,"" Ann says."
positive;Eugene LaBar, a rug importer arriving from Mexico, had arrived in the city, bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus.
positive;It's such a fun look at different musical styles, exciting people at the crossroads between modern and traditional that is Istanbul, and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in Istanbul and Thrace.
positive;Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms.
negative;"Go rent ""Droid Runner"" (Fred Olen Ray) or ""The Dead Hate the Living"" (Full Moon) instead."
negative;A Situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent Armageddon.
negative;The atmosphere is stolen from the movie 300, which wasn't that great in the first place.
negative;"This one is voiced by someone with a ""smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults"" attitude.<br /><br />As a stand alone movie, it is awful."
negative;Boy, was I wrong!
positive;Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable.
positive;No, I did not feel good at all after watching it, but the film was as successful as it can be.<br /><br />Robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic.
negative;Sorry Tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, drop Lambert and check out Leonardo Dicaprio.
positive;It could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people, with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second.
negative;For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular.
negative;"Yeah, she screwed me in front of the judge and jury!"""
negative;We think that we are going in one direction, but instead we head in another one.
negative;<br /><br />Was there a good performance in the whole thing?
negative;"The resultant artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques."
positive;I think this is a great show, and I hope people catch-on before the season's over.
negative;Every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense, anticipation and allure to the plot.
negative;The title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie but it is so far from it that I couldn't believe it.
negative;Convicted, is almost imperfect.
positive;The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.<br /><br />So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author.
negative;I think that NBC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is...
positive;!<br /><br />Ruby
positive;It's not boring and it's not unoriginal.
positive;What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered the Mount Carmel.
negative;The character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another.
negative;They could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script.
positive;It also has memorable performances, beautiful scenerary and great action and direction.
negative;The remaining characters aren't so much common as they are equally killable.
positive;But I also agree that the moving picture of the young girl with the dark hair and the familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable.
positive;This is the retarded, inverted mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
positive;"Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for; satirical farce."
positive;Although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way.<br /><br />All in all a foreseeing of who and what we are.
negative;It takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film I have scene in a long time.
negative;"Where to begin: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, ""action"" in places."
positive;There is a prop hand and head or two, but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive.
negative;There are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning.
positive;The 2-Disk Special Edition Is Due Out This Summer (2007).<br /><br />This rates an 8.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
positive;This film is brilliant and life affirming.
positive;Shame on you all!<br /><br />Personal rating: 8/10
negative;Pope's acting is fine, but Owen is unfortunately under-used.
negative;Well probably for the money.
positive;The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.<br /><br />If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring.
negative;And he gets it wrong EVERY TIME!
positive;"The only real problem I have with this film is the title; ""The Shepherd""?"
negative;This has to be one of the biggest misfires ever...the script was nice and could have ended a lot better.the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade.
positive;From the very first scene, you keep seeing brand new features you weren't expecting to encounter.
negative;And, unfortunately, they are right.
positive;<br /><br />In the voice department, the choices in talent are top notch for the story-lines, which are usually just an excuse for crude, fascinating parodies of pop-culture, politics, movies and TV shows, music, detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit.
negative;Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence.
positive;"He likes to hire stars, either character actors or others and then allow them to improvise, sometimes with varying results.<br /><br />With his crew in ""Sharky's Machine"" he gets some fine moments, and sometimes some overblown grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and good-natured-ness."
positive;Had my work cut out for me for a long time.
negative;This discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material.
positive;The animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked.
positive;"It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).<br /><br />There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."
positive;Jean Muir is a lousy actress.<br /><br />So who was the beautiful one?
positive;Luckily, I found a tape recently with about six episodes I taped long ago, and the jokes stayed very fresh.
positive;Maybe you are all too smart to get it.
negative;Then the talking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never exactly good like in good movies.
negative;This is the confusion in which I speak.
positive;But damn...
negative;Kasparov thought then, and still does, that IBM cheated.<br /><br />Game Over tries to seem unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated.
negative;The cover had a cool picture but I shouldn't judge a cheesy movie by its cover.
negative;It results in a wincingly unfunny film.
negative;I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3.
negative;"It's one thing to fudge the facts, it's another to drop the ball: the executions were carried out between 12:45-1:19 AM, April 14; Truman is shown at the prison 22 HOURS LATER!<br /><br />I was totally underwhelmed by the ""acting""."
positive;This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e.
positive;It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband.
negative;The actors talk like they are reading from a board staged behind the camera.
negative;As the deaths continue to mount, Mr. Martin obviously isn't having much success.
positive;These are the ones I remember best as a four year old.
positive;"The majority we are aware of are from Warner Brothers' LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES; featuring Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and the like."
negative;I know i loved this movie when i was 12-14 years old.
positive;At various times, I found myself thinking that the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean but a pale caricature.
negative;Go right ahead.
negative;Lil flip and Lil Wayne should of both died.Lil' flip sucks.
positive;The animation is good for it's time, and the plot - though a little simple - is quite jolly.
positive;Not the best of movies, but definitely well worth watching.
positive;"This is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made.<br /><br />I saw this growing up and it was, and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as ""Fast times"" but just as great.<br /><br />There is a serious side to this movie, as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and morphs into a drama about halfway through."
positive;"It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of ""civil liberties for all"" in the face of terrorism and fear."
negative;<br /><br />This movie seems to be very low budget.
positive;Since seeing *Revenge of the Rats*, I've read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin.
negative;Also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...<br /><br />Sounds promising?<br /><br />Not really.<br /><br />I became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film.
positive;A metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford, to get rid of the rats.
negative;How did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor?
positive;IT's rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate.
positive;Very well done and but I would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost.
positive;In the end Vito have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters.
positive;Yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground.
positive;"Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.<br /><br />Grade: *** ¬Ω out of *****"
positive;The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn.<br /><br />The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing.
positive;Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown.
positive;One of the funniest films I ever saw in the theater back in the early '70s, and sadly, it's only been on TV a few times since.
positive;Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character.<br /><br />Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view, but she is a superb actress.
positive;The film quality could be better, the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet, and the acting of several characters IS a bit hammy, but it's not overboard.
negative;I was sorely disappointed in this movie.
negative;I say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how.
negative;share a beer late at night, spilling their guts to each other.
negative;Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor.
negative;Ask your Oxford dictionary some questions.
negative;So this ugly guy with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend.
positive;A classic scene indeed.
negative;"Joseph Cotten(""Citizen Kane"")plays the crusty old Baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment."
positive;In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or whoever) is alone with the symbol of the Enemy.
positive;"The conference table is ...""full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an Oregon lake...there are no drugs now in Hollywood"".<br /><br />This was before the tragedy occurred."
positive;"There are some excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves, and the dysfunctional family he lives with; his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted; the mother has no idea what to do- spends her time drinking with her boyfriend.<br /><br />This film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class American society; these kids had no outlet; what is available for them in this dirt-water town?"
negative;The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.
positive;The music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works.
positive;Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley play Quinn's superiors, with Sutherland a true zealot and Kingsley as the more level-headed one.
positive;The script- so real.
negative;If they were intentionally trying to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least reel in the right audience??
positive;Regarding the similar topic, I'd say it's definitely better than the more famous `8 mm', directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage.
negative;Obviously not well staged...or trained !
positive;The show's producer and the station manager argue about content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes.<br /><br />There are a few technical errors.
positive;The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper.<br /><br />So just understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you won't be a bit disappointed.
positive;The only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most clich√© movies I've ever seen.
negative;That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing.
positive;"From there the parents and her brother change; what with being knocked out and ""saved"" by Jesus."
positive;As her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is appropriately virile,--he was apparently born craggy--and a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo.
negative;Really Paranormal State revolves around a Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell who would probably be running Penn State's yearly Anime Convention if it wasn't for this show.
positive;Many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which Mr. Tarentino loved so much, and probably still does.
negative;There is so much throttling going on that you almoost overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead carp, and mooves just as quickly.
negative;What on earth was that?
negative;Examples of sports movies I liked (and I haven't seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All American, All the Right Moves, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men Out, and Rocky, among others.
negative;As I mentioned before, I'd love to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought.
negative;Please, don't watch it.
positive;"""Railway Children"" is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alike.<br /><br />There are several moments that stand out proudly in ""Railway Children"" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence ¬ñ one happens to be our three children; Bobby, Phyllis, and Peter."
negative;Even though Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons, they still act like a couple of love struck newlyweds, cooing and sighing, batting their eyes at one another and whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears almost to the point of nausea.
positive;The three names that mean the most to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore.
positive;Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions, should enjoy as well.
negative;"The real ""Italian Job"" , The Adventures of Tom Jones; but oh that it should come to this, there was more realistic drama in Carry On Camping."
negative;The DVD is fairly wretched, which suits the film.
positive;He is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read, then you understand that angels were far from perfect.
negative;Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you: <br /><br />Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button.
positive;The surprising part of this film isn't really about how these kids running around causing themselves and others trouble, but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so call loyalty between them.
positive;The story was an interesting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances.
negative;Ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...).
positive;They are good.
negative;It was dumb.
positive;Each of the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her screen name), who plays Michael's mother!
positive;So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that's only happened three times before.
negative;I want my 74 minutes back!
positive;Clearly, this film meant a lot to him.
negative;Network security alone would prevent that from happening.
positive;<br /><br />I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot.
positive;The only major damage at the end of the last reel from water.
positive;I found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second.
negative;It will feel to you that half an hour later you've turned off the screen, but as you go to your bed you see it's only 15 minutes after midnight.
positive;It is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is hard to say who is more convincing.
negative;If you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
positive;This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.
positive;Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be a 'Yellowcoat' ( all the important staff members wore them ).
positive;"Pure, unadulterated, mindless hokum, lavishly produced (low-budgeted, actually, but using sets and costumes left over from ""The Robe,"" this Technicolored spectacle looks like it cost millions)."
negative;I repeat, NEVER.
negative;"One deleted scene in particular - in which 'Charlie Chaplin' (Denis Lavant) and 'Madonna' (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film (I won't spoil it, but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half-succeeds).<br /><br />The two strands of the narrative, unconnected literally, are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa."
positive;However, I endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together.
negative;"From the Cheesy mockumentaries like Discovery Channel's ""The Haunting"" to Scooby Doo Reality shows like ""Ghost Hunters""."
negative;The lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows.
positive;Although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like).
negative;He's actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including a patronizing misogynist old doctor(who'd also really, REALLY boring), a greasy guy who looks like he's cornered the market on hair oil, another guy so dull he doesn't even make much of an impression, a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry over the old guy's patronizing, and a female photographer with a Farah Fawcett haircut(pre-Farah, of course) and about as much liveliness as a dead duck.<br /><br />What are any of these people's names?
negative;My favorite parts were.1.
positive;The film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise.
positive;Two of the town's elders sensing there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience.<br /><br />The two girls embark in a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know, calling and running errands and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise they will attend the park concert next Sunday.
positive;It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr Team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team.
positive;The suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father.
positive;The problem, I think, is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much.
positive;The dialog is crisp, the pace is fast.
negative;A potentially good story and not that badly done I guess.
negative;"Second; there are three American Kids."
positive;Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie, not Bakjwi.
positive;Not only does it give a great visual to the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any CGI bad guys.<br /><br />Grade: **** ¬Ω out of *****
negative;The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clich√©s it is rehashing.
negative;This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan calmly walks across the street.
negative;There's plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.
positive;The nudity of this film is not erotic.
negative;True there's a gun & a bottle & a dame & the lead is a private eye, but that ain't what makes the genre, folks.
negative;Little Jesse, is shitting out post modernism as if he'd just eaten Donnie Darko and then douched himself to death.
negative;You name it, this awful movie suffered in areas of acting, plot, storyline, and special effects.
positive;Geena Davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold.
positive;Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality.
positive;It has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups.
negative;PERMANENT!
positive;I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality.
negative;He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fall in love.
negative;Give me a break.
positive;Such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.
positive;Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor).
positive;And yet, I have been searing for a video of it for years and years to no avail.
positive;Kim Basinger is athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey.
positive;Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end.
negative;i would not recommend this movie to any one.
positive;And a character like Blade deserves more (imo).
positive;But don't worry.
positive;She's three years younger than me, and she grew up in North Jersey.
negative;"Then, the dopey American scientists uproot the tree, bring it back to life ""in the name of science"", & allows it to SLOWLY amble about the island, killing off everyone who has done him wrong."
positive;These two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up.
positive;"There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of ""Hynckel-ism"" to make the propaganda point."
negative;You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here... 3/10
positive;An interesting film, and one that makes me want to read Melville.
positive;I rate it 8 out of a difficult 10.<br /><br />
positive;She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room.
negative;"Oh and yep....they do full meals too.<br /><br />Love the comment by the guy who hated the ""EVOO"" comment."
positive;I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do.
positive;"As Candy's interpersonal environment swings further and further out of control, David just grows bouncier, perkier, and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt Gen-X ""Tigger."""
positive;"He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project."
negative;Could it be the serial killer himself, who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars, a la Hannibal Lecter?
negative;This backyard home video is garbage.
negative;This means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril, they will decide to get back together again.
negative;Perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the Bette Davis horrors.
negative;Somebody gets eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as he's swimming across a lake.
negative;"There is no switch from ""I'm playing FBI guy!"""
positive;Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending.
positive;Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire.
positive;He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies.
positive;Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, forever inscrutable, denied a voice, except for an excruciating snatch of song.
negative;If you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills.
negative;- The dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history.
negative;He eventually gets there but it takes the whole film before we are able to have a laugh at the Russian style of Revolution in Mars.
positive;Why should Benes like him?
negative;Scrap that, you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place.
negative;There seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters.<br /><br />I do not wish to assign any blame, for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation.
positive;"Like ""The Kingdom"" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject.<br /><br />The movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only end up by being a ""cautionary tale"" about one botched one."
negative;You can decide.
negative;A guilty pleasure?
negative;I do applaud the makers for at least trying to take the genre into more supernatural, metaphysical realms and understand the rough losses lost-in-translation, but with zero substance to back any of it's freakishness up this will likely be relegated to obscure fanboy's bong-ridden basements.
negative;I used to think so, but this one is a perfect example of one that (for me) doesn't make it.... maybe it's because I'm too dumb?
positive;"Captain Lance intervenes, ""The Army doesn't shoot prisoners, Joe."""
negative;"Read the other reviews to see why.<br /><br />I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they didn't even afford themselves that little luxury; they just act like cardboard cutouts."
negative;Imagine a pro-nazi film being reviewed strictly on film merit.
negative;'s path).
negative;As a result of these cost-cutting actions, it's not surprising that the film is bad, though the idea of trying to make this sort of film was pretty original.
negative;"The fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical ""stupid kung-fu plot""."
negative;This has to be the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.
positive;This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released.
negative;The only reason I'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
negative;Too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.<br /><br />There is a very bad sub-plot about Russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals, of course they try to catch Buddy.
negative;He is with a young woman who dislikes Karmen's seductive dancing and there is a dance-off between the two women.<br /><br />After that the story [such as it is] becomes even more muddled.<br /><br />With Lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where.<br /><br />Karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves.<br /><br />There is more singing.
positive;This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is CREDIBLE.
positive;I had always wanted to see this film and the first three-fourths proved I hadn't waited in vain.
negative;i paid $2.00 for this piece of crap, i want my money back.
positive;During WWII, there were a bazillion movies created by Hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike.
positive;The acting is pretty decent, as the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, though I must admit that Donlevy's role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles.
positive;His staff included resident comic Ted Bovis ( Paul Shane ), his sidekick Spike ( Jeffrey Holland ), miserable Punch and Judy man Mr.Partridge ( Leslie Dwyer ), snobby ballroom dancers Barry ( Barry Howard ) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves ) Diane Holland ), and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh ( Ruth Madoc ), who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity.
negative;IMDb made me do it.
positive;That's because the President fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberies--all based on inside information.
positive;However, as I guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film.<br /><br />It is great to watch a gay affirmative film.
positive;"The ""killer"" stalking New York, in this story, is not a rug importer from Mexico, but beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just arrived from Cuba."
negative;Nice cinematography.
negative;Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who lamented this point when them Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the eighties.
negative;These detective-level Japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect.<br /><br />Why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink?
positive;And be sure to watch/read the credits - they're the icing on the cake!
positive;7/10
negative;2 a lot of street thugs looking like junkyard keepers get instantly overpowered by the Asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of the back of a manure truck.
positive;I would actually advise people to read all the reviews here...including the ones with spoilers, before watching the movie.
negative;"One instance of plot stupidity was when ""lead robber"" accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid."
positive;Malcolm - get to school...)
positive;"We'll save our comparison of that turkey to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and its deconstruction of the American male for another day.<br /><br />That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision, in postwar France, of a kind of hyper-masculine mec that may or may not have ever existed, is practically beside the point."
negative;Who cares!
negative;Hargh... this film is so bad it's almost good.
positive;A savage, undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival.
positive;What I'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all.
positive;Another pitfall for the movie version of a TV series is the inevitable comparisons that are made.
negative;He does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome.
positive;This is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One, and The Chase.<br /><br />If you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the actual median for Four Friends is 7.6.
positive;I can't really criticize this film.
negative;Of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office.
negative;You realize very quickly the movie isn't going to get any better but, you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get.
negative;Not because of the 3-D imagery, which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery, but what a lame ending!
positive;it has all the makings of an instant classic-- car crashes, deliciously lewd sex scenes, feuding families, street fights, amazing music, severed heads, and lemmy from mot√∂rhead narrates the story line!
positive;"I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: ""Fire""."
positive;Jenny Augutter is especially believable in her role as 'Bobbie' the older sibling of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter.The adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.The scenery is lovely,the trains a part of Britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving.
positive;Not ideal, not good or bad but believable.
positive;However, for the life of me, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns.
negative;Now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow, semi-lucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they're showing you.
negative;This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures.
positive;Michael York is lost here.
negative;This is Where No Man Has Gone Before and Wished He Never Had in the First Place.
positive;"Too bad the ""Academy"" doesn't give an ""Oscar"" for dancing."
negative;As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood.
positive;Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies.
positive;"""Here we can tell just when to drink the New Year in,"" exclaims Holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness."
positive;"While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life.<br /><br />This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film, ""Remember the Night"", an underrated gem."
negative;Whatever.<br /><br />I don't know what's up with the subtitles of the version I saw.
negative;That American soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself, and those barbarians brutally murdered him!
positive;This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting looked effortless and I reckon Bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur.
negative;Someone, somewhere, said, this is how to make a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add plenty of slow motion shots of horse hooves splashing in murky puddles, add snowflakes hovering around while two boring characters are speaking to each other, and oh yes rain pouring down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening, and don't forget the black silhouettes walking toward us with fire blazing behind them, and lots of torches burning, and of course blurry fight scenes during which it's not clear what is actually happening because we don't have the budget for the gory special effects so just throw in the sound of metal clanking, and, oh, by the way, don't let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them, and cross fingers, hope that fans of sword and sorcery films will eat it up, even though it is complete doo doo, and go straight to video, do not pass GO .
negative;Spare us.<br /><br />I kept hoping it would improve but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where this was heading and so turned off the TV and went to bed.
negative;The print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned.
negative;However, it's not all bad.
negative;The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm.
positive;Ernesto Alterio is not that bad, but he's not half as good actor as his father... And what to say about Luppi??
positive;"But his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden ""cache"" of coins."
negative;The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses.
positive;But this show is perfect.
positive;I've seen Riverdance in person and nothing compares to the video, but the show is awesome.
positive;Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40's woman.
negative;Crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds.
negative;But you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining.
negative;Not once have any of these shallow, unattractive women evolved.
positive;And with the Online capabilities of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style.
negative;Jackie Mason's daughter when I first saw her looked like his wife.
negative;The one-trick musical score tries to make up for the blandness, swooping portentously into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of protracted catatonia.<br /><br />Like an adolescent revolutionary on a self-righteous tirade, this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation--patriarchy is wrong--and thoroughly squanders its energies, hammering on this point.
negative;?<br /><br />If he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the entire movie could have ended right there!
negative;And another thing...
positive;"Ostensibly, ""Colorado Territory"" scenarist Edmund H. North & ""A Place in the Sun"" scribe Harry Brown drew their screenplay from western film maker Charles Marquis Warren's taut novel about a group of die-hard cavalrymen cut off from any escape route who must prevent murderous redskins from launching a devastating raid against helpless white settlers."
negative;"This is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see ""what happened next"" - this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends."
positive;The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.
negative;Well nothing could be further from the truth!
negative;Apparently, everyone in the cast, including the women, were called Steve.
positive;So multi-facet was the context and its thrills, there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists.
negative;There's some.
positive;They got it at Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach.<br /><br />When I got to California (all of 13), Anaheim had the Concrete Wave and Carlsbad had a great park as well.
positive;My greatest surprise was to find that Ray Charles was heroine addicted, and how he treated his own family.
positive;"!<br /><br />That being said, this film is significantly inferior to ""Until Death"" which was a really good turn for Van Damme."
positive;What is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge.
negative;Veteran movie-director Irvin Kershner produced, and maybe should directed as well (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?).
negative;I just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion.<br /><br />
positive;Superb editing, outstanding acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack.
positive;Above everything, I felt that the story made sense, and everything fits in it's place, properties of a good script.<br /><br />I must also mention the soundtrack, which helps the creation of an amazing environment.<br /><br />And if you think of the resources Fernando Fragata used to make this film, I believe it will make many Hollywood producers envious...
negative;Opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'Kit for Cat', 'Tweety's S.O.S' fails to live up to that classic cartoon.
positive;While he is NOT a bad guy, he is a bit flighty and hasn't done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a jolly good time.
positive;its funny, original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat.
negative;I suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between Henry and Fanny I snapped and had to turn it off.
positive;Pensyltucky.<br /><br />OUR point is just this.
negative;It was stiff, and while his Tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity.
negative;I knew a bit about the real Ed Gein, so I figured this was a medium-budget Hollywood version of the real events.
negative;My wife is into group sex.
positive;One of the cutest movies I have seen in years...
positive;I ride the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones.
positive;The second half has him out in the field, making love to the Jackal's woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies.
negative;It then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time.
positive;Laurel & Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields, and Chaplin.
negative;This is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography , bad scripting and dialogue , no character development and clich√© jungle warfare scenes.<br /><br />It fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the Japanese Army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an ill-equipped and badly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle.<br /><br />The film failed as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience in fact they stayed away in droves.<br /><br />I am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an Australian film.
positive;The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina.
negative;Many elements of suspense and dark comedy, that made the original one great, are missing in this one.
positive;Her charm and beauty held the film together.
negative;but during the film I found out that this was an absolute disaster... it wasn't biblical at all... only the boat and the animals were similar to the story... if you want a visual 'translation' of the Bible version of Noah then DON'T go watch this movie!
positive;"I highly recommend ""Dogtown."""
positive;That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question.
negative;This laughably foolish cowncept is one of the all-time cheesy howlers.
positive;As a result, as one story is concluded and another started, the scenes within the film become disjointed.
positive;It isn't anyone's fault but Dahmer's that 17 people died, but being a criminal psychology student, I was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented, truthfully, in this film.
positive;Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy.
negative;"What made it worse was how ABC swept the whole incident under the rug; instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals, they had some pop psychologists send stern warnings TO THE AUDIENCE about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too harshly."
negative;Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring.
negative;The kids are not particularly deep but hey, that works for teens.
negative;If I were in his shoes I would love to have an extra parent in my life, especially one this nice.
positive;My vote is ten.
positive;<br /><br />If only Hollywood would learn from Independent film makers!
negative;Oh but this is woeful.
negative;"The ""Oakville Tribune"" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be."
positive;Um .... a serious film about troubled teens in Singapore, a country I have not much knowledge on but have the previous wrong impression that all the kids there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government.
positive;"But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity, something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compared, is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30's Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire, not to mention Dick Powell), let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in movies like the repulsive ""American in Paris."""
negative;Don't take that mean that it's so bad that it's good because it's not.
negative;Sorry everybody who love this movie, but poor writing, flashy direction, and bad acting does not make a good movie.
negative;Observe Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film.<br /><br />It is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors.
positive;!<br /><br />My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by Van Damme movie standards not in any other film category.<br /><br />i.e.
negative;A work that is mind-bendingly execrable.
negative;Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture, every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most of the actors are non English speakers).<br /><br />Everything is lukewarm in this epic.
negative;Sure, she ends up in a nice red bikini top and a wrap-around skirt near the end, but that's too little (so to speak) too late.
negative;It could have been great.
negative;the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), creepy acting.
positive;"imagine ""24"" completely uncensored, given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill/prevent and you have an idea of how good this TV series is."
positive;It's good for a Van Damme film.
positive;The only brief sites of civilisation are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, from both of which derive behaviour that is anything but civilised.<br /><br />The basic story intercuts three stories.
negative;Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie.
positive;He allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments).
positive;In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions.
positive;True love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend.
positive;I genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies.
positive;Jean Renoir's homage to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways.
negative;I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this film that had I loved as a kid, and then as I saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... Why in the world did I like this film as a Kid, watching it again as an adult I realized that this film is terrible.
positive;If that's the case, look for the Korean version.
positive;"The whole point of rendition is not to ""torture"" but to get ""terror suspects"" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers."
positive;Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness.
positive;If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.
positive;No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed.
negative;If there's anything worse than this movie I don't want to see it.
negative;Mike and the gang send the uninitiated dorks back to bring Sam down but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their throats.
positive;"John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula(Baron Latos is his alias at the start of the film and in ""House of Frankenstein"")."
positive;Another 20 years either side of my birth date, and i would not have seen and felt....
negative;I dig mainstream films, I dig silly stupid films, I dig retro indie films, and nearly any other type/genre if carried out well.
negative;From photography (lots of scenes without focus!)
negative;This soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous.
positive;We see the way the external pressures of the war complicate and corrode their relationship.
negative;Everything was poor about this film.
positive;Travis and Sandy(Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.)are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a Mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement.
negative;He must have owed someone a favor.
positive;The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story).
positive;The way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing.
negative;The plot is done by the numbers, the dialog has no sparkle, the acting is pedestrian.<br /><br />However, dedicated aficionados of Monogram productions should enjoy it.
positive;The agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the President.
positive;On the other hand, if you're looking for light entertainment, please stay away.
negative;Anupam Kher is an excellent actor, he debuted at 28 playing a 50 yr old in SARAANSH<br /><br />Now he turns director with OJJ<br /><br />The film has a good plot but it's regressive<br /><br />The theme has been done to death and Urmila's character looks too put on while Anil-Mahima and Abhi- Tara tracks are too sudden and then forgotten<br /><br />The film moves a snail pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek where Fardeen says to sell the house<br /><br />Abhishek getting caught for a crime and Anil shouting at him<br /><br />The climax is too much though<br /><br />Directorally Anupam shows potential, but has some way to go Music is okay<br /><br />Anil Kapoor excels in his part like always Fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs to improve Abhishek is excellent, this was a turning pt, people realized he can act Urmila is okay Mahima and Tara are wasted Waheeda is good
positive;It should win awards.
negative;Is the Starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots?
positive;I thought Joe Cortese was great.
positive;We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in.
negative;A few scenes were cut from the film, which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters, due to continuity errors in costume - a result, no doubt, due to the absence of a shooting script and Korine's tendency for improvisation.
negative;Pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people.<br /><br />This movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending.
positive;Just let yourself go to this one completely.
negative;Apart from all that, I found this sexual/political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn.
positive;Indeed, Lance's own men want to kill him and this foreshadows the attitude of troops during the Vietnam War when they fragged their own officers.
positive;He and Ramsey are well-matched, and their inevitable sex scene (brief but memorable) is followed by a compelling sequence in which Ramsey describes a childhood trauma which has defined his life to date.<br /><br />Filmed on hi-def video and transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition, the movie's meager budget places limitations on the scope and grandeur of Cox's ambitions, though the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor drawback.
positive;Within days, Sheila has two parties independently pursuing her: a treasury agent (Barry Kelley) looking to arrest her for smuggling crimes, and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak.
negative;"Because of the ""clever"" camera angles, you never see any actual town, and the interior of the sets looked like old, long-abandoned shacks."
positive;While I do think the pacing of this film could be improved, I do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating.<br /><br />Examples : <br /><br />Pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y ?
positive;An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around.
negative;The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada.. so it was a co production, missed the third party concerned..
positive;Even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work, as Nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible, given the subject matter.<br /><br />I love this, and love it more each time I watch it.
positive;Yup, I said it.
positive;I figured I had nothing to lose in buying it.
positive;"Buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, that does things ""their way"" to clean up the streets of New York of criminals."
positive;Well, he's the MAN.<br /><br />In short: a good movie.
positive;Some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into Monkey Island, but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun, and also adds to the replay value.
positive;This is one of my favorite movies.
negative;Pointless camera jerks, all at weird angles, overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes.
negative;Because I PROMISE you that you do not want to watch it forwards.<br /><br />5.
negative;At the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs.
positive;"Ken Loach showed the world the down-and-out flip side of Swinging London with ""Poor Cow"", about London woman Joy (Carol White) hooking up with a thief and having a son with him, only to see the man end up in the slammer."
negative;"The opening images of this film, of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's ""Mister Lonely"" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion."
positive;This show only comes once in a life time!
negative;The problem was there were too many unnecessary things.
negative;This movie is NOT funny.
positive;Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot!
negative;The musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy in the beginning, but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to unendurable proportions.
positive;They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene.
positive;It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc.
positive;Finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed.
negative;Furthermore, he couldn't get Ellen Barkin to give 110%.
negative;That qualifies her for a supporting role at best.
negative;Where is the magic?
positive;<br /><br />All in all a brilliant,fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on DVD when it comes out.
negative;But hey, if the future changed in a split second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic though.
negative;it was constantly annoying.
negative;After realizing Dracula's treachery, he opens the Count's coffin to sunlight and POOF!, he's gone, just like that.<br /><br />The only person who didn't appear to just be phoning in her lines was Jane Adams as Nina.
negative;The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.
positive;2 seconds chopped off here.
negative;Its not that I dislike figure skating, although I don't, its that I dislike cliched, bad movies.
positive;During the time he watches he learns that the current Governor-elect Hotchkins (Earl Holliman) is visiting Dominoe, as is a slick Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman).
positive;As for the leading actress from Guide ( that's how I can recall her instantly ) there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there.
negative;More than half of the film is commercials (no, really!).
negative;Apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO stars Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination.
negative;He gives a barely decent performance.
negative;So, for those of you like me, skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty (sometimes unclothed) girls.
negative;He pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam.
negative;however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film.
negative;It's like a 3-minute Cliff's Notes version of the flick.
negative;This is one of the worst pictures ever made.<br /><br />I do not recommend Plump Fiction.
positive;We tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which may turn out to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake.
negative;The saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it!!!
positive;Much like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll.
negative;Well the irony is, isn't that what we were doing (or supposed to be doing) the entire time we're watching Inglorious Basterds?
negative;It is so brilliant, so original it is so GREAT.
negative;The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing.
positive;Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics.<br /><br />Although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act.
positive;I was riveted.
negative;I'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated.
positive;A small point, but curious, considering how many details the screenwriters got right.<br /><br />Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers.
positive;Ultimately, this is Lynch's key film.
negative;Overall, 4 out of 10
negative;The Movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller.
positive;"The film leaves us fittingly on a single, triumphant note at the end of ""I Sing the Body Electric,"" pointing to the blindingly bright, boundless future and all the promise it held.<br /><br />""Fame"" couldn't have been set anywhere else."
positive;), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.<br /><br />Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on.
negative;<br /><br />So so.. at best
positive;In the second, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, waylays a stagecoach, and kidnaps one of its female occupants.
negative;Aggravating...
positive;People are shown getting tired and hurt unlike 99% of action film where the hero is a limitless fountain of energy and each blow instantly dispatches an opponent to death.
negative;No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting.
positive;I don't know if it's fair for me to review this.
negative;mystery, but then suddenly they bring in this Count Dracula look-alike that starts babbling about the devil.
negative;I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much.
positive;SO all i can say is Hind comedy is finally evolving.
negative;This movie starts out the way every movie should start out, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and/or topless.
positive;Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman, then chasing after the woman.
negative;Cotrona.<br /><br />5.
negative;"Everything is bad; really bad."
positive;"It's a great showcase for the talent that Ms. Knight has demonstrated her entire career--on television, in movies and on the stage, where she won the Tony for ""Kennedy's Children."
negative;I'm also a fan of her British detectives.
negative;Whereas Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks, Mister Lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness.
positive;<br /><br />There is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out.
negative;He assumes the throne and prepares to marry the princess but the night before her wedding, the princess escapes to the land to go and battle the beast herself.
positive;But soon Harry is hiding in the rumble seat, as his wife drives past in her roadster, and the girls boy friends turn up - angry at their two rivals.<br /><br />The short works well and is amusing, and gives one a better idea of the persona that Harry Langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master.
positive;I never took to his replacement, Squadron Leader Clive Dempster ( David Griffin ).
positive;But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here, more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite Louis Jourdan who plays David Savage.
positive;I think not.
positive;Briggs never found an audience.
negative;He and Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster like it's an everyday occurrence.
positive;Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene.
negative;Near the end of the movie, the film is revealed.
positive;Both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own sense of ethics.
negative;It is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid, and Wild Bill Hickock, though I would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows.
negative;Maybe I'm not that picky when I know going in that this is not a blockbuster film.
positive;The ironies abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that doesn't preach but neither does it condemn.
positive;Like VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, all of them have their ups and downs (mostly downs) but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it--battered and bruised, nevertheless.<br /><br />In this film, men are mostly pigs.
negative;"A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other."
positive;EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully-realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song.
positive;He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle) a male prostitute who gives Pip food and shelter, Jenny (the very fine Carly Pope) who saves him from a bashing by her associate Derek (Ryan McDonell) and becomes romantically entangled with Pip, and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) in a finely wrought sympathetic role as a priest.
positive;Well...as it so happened, during the filming of this movie, a Nativity scene was needed.
positive;Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among animals.<br /><br />With Cervantes's tale we can only see the dreamer, without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement.
negative;My 9-year old daughter's first forays into film-making are superior to this - and she was filming the dog sleeping.
positive;The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words!
negative;<br /><br />This movie is, well, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part.
positive;It will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country.
positive;There are so many funny lines in it!
negative;Larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, focusing instead of putting his swaying, strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it.
negative;And then, after ninety-three interminable minutes, it just stops and the end credits begin.
positive;I thought the cinematography was excellent.
positive;<br /><br />Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a low-key, nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in Brooklyn, NY in the waning days of World War II.
positive;It made me chuckle, but didn't distract too much from the overall picture.
negative;I am a huge fan of Northern Exposure.
positive;If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.
positive;Another erased there.
negative;You'll know which scene I mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which Korine has previously been hailed.)
negative;The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me -melt-.
negative;They violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the CIA.
positive;Of course, it's also an anxiety movie.
negative;We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time.
negative;Characters were undeveloped, the monsters (plants in this case) left unexplained, and clich√©s were dripping all over.<br /><br />The only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloody/gory scenes, although the gore pales in comparison with movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer.
negative;What I thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was Grocer's proposal for a hit man's union, but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke, the idea never really got developed.
positive;He enlists in the military, much to the consternation of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper where Knox is employed, and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school.
positive;This film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.<br /><br />The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town.
negative;It seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class.
positive;"While ""art"" isn't precisely the word I'd use to describe Michael Jackson's 'Thriller (1983),' it is an intensely-likable hybrid of schlock horror and music, and an outrageously-campy short film that remains remarkably endearing nearly 25 years later."
negative;But it's just not funny.
negative;"I suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be "" cool "" , but looking back now ( 45 years ) it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value !"
positive;In the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection.
negative;!<br /><br />The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which Sergio agrees .<br /><br />So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ?
negative;<br /><br />By far, this movie was much more horrid than the Shakespeare novel itself.
positive;There are a few every now and then that make me think deeply, and disturb me a lot.
positive;The whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done.
positive;All these years and it has remained in my life.
positive;I knew nothing about this film until I watched it... my brother in fact suggested I take a look.
positive;Each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and piratey (if that's a word) tune.
negative;I can't say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on.
positive;Some of the actors/actresses are from his other productions, he obviously used the same composer later on, as the cheesy soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend.
positive;It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together at their most human, and most basic persons.
positive;How much of the film is true is questionable.<br /><br />That Oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true.
positive;Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style.
positive;A wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work.
negative;The third one was when they made Jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where I wanted to go into the T.V.
negative;total crap.<br /><br />I was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version I have seen of Mansfield Park.
negative;Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other.
negative;Trapped.<br /><br />The tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen.
negative;Jack Brooks himself is not all that interesting, at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time he's given.
negative;"Obviously, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, ""What if I was the person who dies?""."
positive;"If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous."
negative;Truly, this is the epitome of crap.
negative;When a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self-gratification.
positive;Instead, take the time to watch and actively LISTEN to the dialog as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot.
positive;It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception.
negative;And I was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it.<br /><br />Perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure: If you have the name of the killer, his entire life's history, a criminal record, and HIS ADDRESS, where is the first place you should look?
positive;The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks.
negative;- The character development is horrendous - The characters that appear in the movie are so clich√©d you would <br /><br />recognize them in your average comic book.
negative;"Especially bad is the editing; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction."
negative;It's just too unbelievable.
positive;The DC is laid out like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background.
positive;WTF!?
negative;At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home.
negative;Jack Brooks battles a few monsters, some heads are crushed, a few humans are slaughtered, and then it's over.
negative;If you're a youth liking kids movies, why not see it?
negative;I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious.
negative;Flaw animation, primitive color-rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous Multiplane-Camera with CGI, mediocre music and a patchwork of different, simple stories.
positive;overall fun movie 7/10
negative;Fuhgeddaboutit.<br /><br />The one character who rang true was portrayed by Gerry Lopez who didn't really act, he was himself pretty much.
positive;A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.
negative;hap hap!
positive;This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.<br /><br />There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.<br /><br />While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats.
positive;(Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.)
positive;It definitely is on my personal list of favorite movies, and for more than just starring Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my `actors to watch.
negative;An Aussie has no business in Ancient Rome.
positive;Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop.
negative;This was the first Chan film made by Monogram.
positive;Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy, easy-going environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even more eerie atmosphere.
negative;And avoid this movie, unless held at gunpoint.
positive;I thought this film was pretty damn original and I will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it.
positive;"With ""Man with the Screaming Brain"", he goes all out again."
positive;Although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface.
positive;There is more imagination packed in this small VHS than I have witnessed in film for years.
positive;This confusion leaves a slightly bitter after-taste.<br /><br />However, the rest of the film is such a feast, this is easy to ignore.
positive;I don't care how predictable it is, I laugh anyway.
positive;Next, a superb performance by John Hurt (Cruz¬¥s father, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as by Irene Papas, each as village elders, as well as by Christian Bale (Papas¬¥ son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage.
positive;Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future.
negative;In some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably.<br /><br />Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster.
positive;This technique does feel a little cheap at times, but fortunately the narration is largely restricted to the film's bookends, as well as providing some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot.
positive;Watch this movie.
negative;I want to know where all the money went?
negative;There IS a difference.
negative;"I was watching TV one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of ""Going Bananas."""
positive;"In the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, ""John Kramer"" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series."
positive;This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story.
positive;With the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - Its great.
positive;Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin.
negative;Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen.
negative;I swear I haven't been that scared watching Steve Carell dance since ... well never.
positive;This movie is 100% action!
positive;"The part in the ""Making Of"" really touched me, when they adressed Brandon Novak's addiction to heroin, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him."
positive;New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene.
positive;If (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this Langdon short (the last released before he did TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating.
positive;For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting.
positive;The film was shot in India and has some good scenery.
negative;And who likes it?
negative;I get that they are trying to make us feel like we are in a cave, but Helllloo...
negative;I very much disliked this movie(Hate is such a strong word!).
negative;Don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book.
negative;It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie.
positive;They try to reach out to the others but shut the others out when those try to reach them.<br /><br />You, the Living is a poetic film set physically in Stockholm but yet universally applicable.
positive;The dialogs are excellent, full of wit and lighthearted charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end (it follows the murder mystery routine anyways), it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters.
positive;Can that EVER exist?
positive;But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station.
negative;Then the cat showed up.
positive;Some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show.
positive;"But he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where most secretive, ""horrendous"" feelings painfully emerge -- envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hate, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion etc."
positive;Through their men, their career, the decades that defined them.
positive;in the words of some he could be clumsy, clever, funny, serious, crazy, sober, and moving or depressing at the same time.
negative;"<br /><br />Word to the wise: vote yourself off this island.<br /><br />(I rated it a 3 for special effects; I took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality.)"
positive;The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick, careful editing are what really make the film stand out, drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes.
negative;This movie is supposed to take place around 1957, but the cops are carrying modern side-handled batons, some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes, and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 9-1-1 (didn't exist back then).
positive;William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice portrays 16th century Venice.
negative;Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves, and Dan Akroyed.
positive;Although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon.
positive;It was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful.
negative;The film is quite boring.
negative;the ending wasn't satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didn't make me feel anything for the characters.
negative;a disgrace for terrible movies!
positive;He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained.
negative;The Nazis cheer as soldier after soldier falls to the snipers skill.
negative;Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation).
positive;I'll believe it when I see it.
negative;There is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film.<br /><br />All and all, very disappointing.
negative;His final 3 movies have to frankly be the WORST I have ever had to sit through.
positive;All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women.
negative;A freak accident alters Nelson's career course and mayhem ensues.<br /><br />The attempts at humor were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless.
positive;There isn't as much action but the acting is just as good.
negative;Spike Lee truly is a product of Affirmative Action.
negative;I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and I had never actually seen it until last night.
positive;The staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation.
positive;I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she him.
negative;Head for the big city, of course!
positive;"I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, ""This guys looks like an idiot."""
negative;This is for slasher completists only.
negative;I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee.
negative;This 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting, but failed miserably.
positive;Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats.
negative;Plus, the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event in order to fit it into the two hours.
positive;I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever!
positive;'Kino' also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major restorations on their prints.
positive;as one reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are likable by the film's end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic.
positive;Peter Boyle, as the working class, hippie and ni**er hater and Dennis Patrick as the uptight suit, play their respective parts immaculately and I can't remember ever seeing the two classes getting together like this without things getting sentimental.
negative;Lots of sex is implied, but hardly shown.
positive;I always wondered why it's not more well known.
positive;He should suspect something instantly, but doesn't.
positive;She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next-door neighbor.
negative;It doesn't even look like a freaking movie.
negative;Othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film.
negative;Ray Bradbury, run and hide!
positive;This movie is powerfully affecting and lingers in the mind long after it is done.
negative;This feeble attempt at veering your typically bland Japanese horror movie more towards a creepy cult hit did not have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved throughout.
positive;Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her.
positive;"Maybe I'm just down because my job was ""outsourced"" last month and now I'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to India and other places overseas."
negative;"Final episode ""Yellow"" is the only segment that's almost entirely successful."
negative;He's the good guy?
positive;Why did CBS take it off the air???
negative;But the whole thing looked like dress-up.
positive;It's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him.
positive;), and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer's spine.
negative;"Hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to make, rather than 1,000 remakes, sequels, and ""shock"" factor films (such as this)."
negative;At least Occy didn't give a crap and just went with it.
negative;There was no character development, all of them were forced on us.
negative;the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary.
negative;I and a friend rented this movie.
positive;Some people have posted that the show sucks.
negative;Not to bad Hugh?
positive;the writing, the acting, the story lines .. everything about this show is absolutely amazing!
positive;Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc.
negative;There are many reasons I'm not a fan of fact based films, but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story.
positive;The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear.
positive;I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot.
negative;The acting is horrible, and the directing is horrendous.
positive;This movie, though released in the 80's still addresses some of the biggest issues in today's world.
negative;No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit...
negative;They took that Nazi's head off yaaayy!
positive;It is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming).
positive;<br /><br />Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch.
positive;as a crazy mob cowboy type, and pesci and Vincent were great also.
positive;There are beautiful women as well, but no sex scenes.
positive;But what the hell happened in the end?
positive;The children are not led to a door in a mountain, with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy.<br /><br />There's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie.
positive;"I was not disappointed.<br /><br />So far, I have shown it to many guys I have dated since, and to my current boyfriend... obviously, they didn't find it as lovely as I do... preferring to call it a ""chick"" movie... but I still laugh and cry."
negative;It needs massive internal reconstruction.
positive;"Use exhibit ""A"" ¬ñ ""The Game Plan"" as evidence of this if you want."
negative;Chinese tries some spinning kick B) skinny leg of Chinese to the throat of negro thug C) finishing death move to his head too much like Walker Texas ranger fake action 8 end titles finally<br /><br />utter rubbish.
negative;He tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times.
positive;Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I have not had the opportunity to view.
negative;Independent or not, solid writing is a must.
positive;Any movie that can get that kinda reaction out of you deserves an award.
negative;This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.
positive;<br /><br />Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches!
negative;some scenes where quite nice though, i'll give it 3 out of 10
positive;The episode is entertaining, smart, and perky.
positive;This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom.
negative;I'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane.
negative;Everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight.
negative;Meanwhile, in Tokyo, an forlorn older painter, Edward Peil (as Kano Indara) laments not having a son to carry on his family line of artists.
negative;Maybe Steve Carell can save it.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this.
positive;Uses dome newer ideas, for flashbacks, and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat.<br /><br />No matter what walk of life a viewer is from, they will buy-in to one or more viewpoints in this film.<br /><br />Would love to see a sequel!
positive;There are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.<br /><br />The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry.
negative;I'm sorry guys, all who thought this film could be something great, I'm afraid you would be disappointed.<br /><br />The standard, the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot.
positive;She suggests that they call Bule and tell him their decision.
negative;And I didn't buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel yard.
negative;OK enough about the hypocritical flaws.
negative;Camilla Bell had no emotion during this movie.
negative;You are just told what happened by Ryan in yet another mechanical voice over.<br /><br />If you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little.
positive;"cross-dressing star eating dog excrement.<br /><br />The premise is about two families: One a pair of inbred trailer trash, which includes Divine and Edith Massey as the egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple."
negative;It wasn't all bad.I just can't believe this movies high score so far.
positive;There were no missteps at all.
negative;The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen.
negative;It did not live up to the title like it should have so boo hoo hoo.
positive;It is a Gothic tale of deception and horror set in the time of the Civil War, with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension running throughout.<br /><br />I'm not putting any spoilers in this review, and if you want to see the film as it should be seen, then be careful of looking it up on the internet, as spoiler reviews of it do abound.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot on Confederate ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school.
negative;And that's not an exaggeration.
negative;and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious .
positive;Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles.
negative;Four army guys with little Bobcats (the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn), are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes!
positive;James Whitmore, who plays Gus, `the man who raised Jed' is actually five years younger than Mature.
positive;Additionally, I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don't usually get this is Asia cinema.
positive;He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it.
negative;This has nothing to do with vampires, though there is one inept blood-drinking scene.
positive;Sure, they're all rehash, but so was Monkey Island 2.
positive;If I really get into how mesmerizing this movie is I won't be able to stop and I'll go way over the IMDb 1000-word limit.<br /><br />Please, please watch this movie.
negative;They do dance together quite comfortably, however, and the Jerome Kern score is unmemorable but not too bad.
negative;Of course, they featured this movie.
negative;Everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs.
positive;I'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie.
negative;It's so disgusting.
negative;This film is a bad film but to gain any nutritional value from it I recommend watching it back to back with Rosemary's Baby.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters.
negative;Try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what I mean...<br /><br />It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually made music for this movie... :(
negative;Nor does he lovingly hold her face and say she can control it.
negative;If you have come to know - and love - Atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find the depiction of her in Imperium - as a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous.
negative;"(""We feel so bad inside!"")"
negative;Don't kill me fans but I have something to say about this.<br /><br />Pros: Well, the most mildly interesting season that I've watched out of all the seasons that are out there of Inuyasha just has tobe the Shichinintai arc.
positive;on top of that the multi-player is great.
negative;This thing plays like reheated TV cop show stuff - lots of bloody beating & lousy continuity - with a dash of Chinatown memories thrown in.
negative;The KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN.
positive;Despite the seriousness of its theme, the film itself seems a lot more cheerful and laden with humor than one might have expected.
negative;It has its moments, but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow.
positive;Donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something.
positive;Directed by the gifted Frank Launder, and produced by the equally adroit Sidney Gilliat, The Happiest Days Of Your Life is a quintessentially British movie, obviously a precursor to the St Trinians franchise, the film entertains the children with it's high jinks clash of the sexes heart, whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent.
negative;Despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (Jackson Bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way.
negative;Rail-thin Moore, looking alarmingly frail in her leotard, has a radiant smile but doesn't convince as Danson's wife, and Danson gets stuck with a paltry, thankless role (he's just there to be a cad).
negative;so this is an hour and a half without fun.
positive;Often Oscar-caliber screenplays, not surprising when you consider Minghella doing the writing.
positive;Still, The Shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!<br /><br />I do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on.
negative;The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it).
negative;Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it.
negative;The plot is that an NYPD diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the Fourth of July.
positive;'Nuf said.
positive;Thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers, Polish fugitives, peeping toms, philandering girlfriends, renegade dogs, and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables.
negative;The plot was non exist and the acting was weak.
negative;Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of THE RELIC.
positive;The Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film You, the Living is not easy to review.
negative;Watch an infomercial instead.
positive;Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema.
negative;Even the voice over narration is stupor inducing.
negative;Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits.
negative;There weren't even 100 passengers on the train.
positive;And I believe Aparna has succeeded to certain extent.
positive;All four are great actors and add to the entertainment.<br /><br />Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work.
negative;HANA-BI has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing.
negative;The ending is about the best thing, besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast, that one can say about the film.
positive;Who doesn't love Hanks?
negative;It does not stay focused on anything for very long.
positive;The performances by the cast are all excellent but it is Diane Lane who shines the brightest.
negative;Outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role, I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film.
positive;You really have to see this movie to believe it!<br /><br />There are some hillarious jokes in the credits (best credits I've seen since Hot Shots) loads of Troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs.
positive;Father tangles with and ultimately kills druggie boyfriend.
negative;Sometimes it would speed up too, making the characters voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film.
positive;So after all of that I give it a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite an eight).
positive;Its what i call the Hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in Hindi cinema.Cheers to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie.
negative;Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing.
negative;the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination.for one the villains look almost normal,not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like.for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves.by that,i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie, with a lot of running around aimlessly.the film didn't have a clear direction.the plot of the movie is hardly original,even for its time.the Texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film, as far as horror goes.the film has little in the way of scares, and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once.i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie, though it failed in its intended purpose.i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end .when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise.i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt.yes, there is some loud screaming,and yes people die,but who cares.much too slow getting to any sort of pay off,if you can call it that.my buddy enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something out of it.the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched, but i doubt i will watch it again.this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version.anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times was chaotic and repetitive.unless you like watching paint dry, occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block, screaming their head off, stay away from this movie.a better bet would be the original Texas chainsaw massacre(1973)1.5* out of 10* which is being generous
positive;As things spiral further out of control, he discovers he must make an important decision - does he take a stand or does he simply go away.<br /><br />I cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for.
positive;I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movie.It stars two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, which when I heard they were in a movie together I resist watching it.Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable movie.It had it's moments where I felt as if they tried to hard, and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material, but there wasn't anything in the movie that I absolutely hated.I even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited Thora Birch, and all the little happy/sad moments are touching and effective.If you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because even though I don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a 5.9 rating seems unfair in my opinion.
positive;Max, who has lived in New York for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend.
positive;This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest.
negative;An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance.
negative;That game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3,4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly.<br /><br />The question of whether IBM cheated all comes down to that single move in game two, where the Deep Blue made the move that any human would make but that had, up to that point, tripped up computers.
positive;She is on shock and is reserved about her feelings: that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you.
negative;But the woman just doesn't get it, she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated.
positive;It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
positive;Why, then, has it not been released on video?
positive;We have seen this type film many times over the years.
positive;We are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments - contrast the warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and cluttered comfort of Labraccio's rooms with the stark, white void of Nelson's.
positive;one thing, one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing..The period of adjustment!
negative;"There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail depicts a truly great event in Australian Military history the brave defence of Australia against the cruel barbaric Japanese Army.Howver this film fails to take into account the story of the ""Fuzzy Wuzzy's"" or the New Guinea natives that The Australians used to help them carry out there military operations."
negative;I can't believe they actually spent money on this one...
negative;Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side.
negative;<br /><br />There was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesn't have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway.
positive;Before cheap air travel came along in the '60's, these camps sprang up along British coastlines, providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners.<br /><br />( As a matter of interest, I worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to all and sundry as 'Shag Land' for reasons I won't go into!
negative;One scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match.
positive;"Hickman was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of New York City and San Francisco ""The French Connection"" and ""Bullitt""."
negative;Sure I know Morgan Freeman won't look at this film in a year and think it's as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby but it's easy money.<br /><br />Where was I?
positive;This is not a gung-ho John Ford cavalry western.
negative;Oh, right...
positive;I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline.
negative;I once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting !
positive;What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions.
positive;Ok, a made for TV blockbuster, but none the less.
negative;However, I am glad I rented despite the fact I would never want to own it.
positive;I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming ¬ñ the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events.
positive;In another, Ted sang the Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' to campers.
positive;The powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre, despite the ominous title.
positive;Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have all that much to do in her first film.
negative;If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror film, then for God's sake don't make one at all!!
negative;<br /><br />This is Ryan Buell's show.
negative;Is that really what film has become?
