negative;Unfortunately, not quite.
positive;A masked killer caught the family, only the little daughter seems to be hidden somewhere and so Arkin decides to help her.
positive;Above all, however, stands Omar Sharif, whom I consider one of the best actors of his time.
positive;Back to the weeds.
negative;The fact that the film has rightly not received a gold boy is due to the large part of it, in my opinion, to the script from whichever source is also oscarnominated.
positive;However, the aliens themselves are not mentioned in the film.
positive;"""Man of Steel"" is a pure action spectacle."
positive;"As far as the film music of Thomas Newman is concerned, he returns in ""Skyfall"" rather back to the roots of 007 and thus puts us in the classic Bond Feeling."
positive;The first 2\3thirds of the film are absolute world class, creating an absolutely captivating tension.
positive;This is because the film is based on true events.
positive;just perfect I find the movie totally good!!
positive;"In order to get his son ""home"", Thomas sets out for France."
negative;Hello, we also watched the movie because it was greatly hyped.
negative;Bravely, Bibi enters as a substitute player, naturally scores a few points and - of course - gets older, because a girl can certainly only make points if she has hexed.
positive;In general, the whole movie is full of bombast action and breathtaking special Effecs that really doesn't have to hide from the competition.
positive;In combination with the recorded comments of various radio and TV commentators, the viewer creates a real racing feeling, even if these scenes sometimes seem a little unintelligible.
negative;And the story was more than laughable.
positive;The light from the ice surface was directed towards the passage running towards them, where Nancy Kerrigan wept bitterly.
positive;The criticism is very appropriate (even if it is very spoiling!
positive;I was incredibly impressed by that.
positive;The only thing left is Q who wants to bring humanity back to justice:-) This film is the proof that Star Trek is better than Star Wars!
positive;That's why there was plenty of room for action, and a Robert Downey Jr.
negative;Sigourney Weaver plays her character as usual super, but unfortunately he has hardly anything to do with the replay, which you could only admire after the first 3 parts.
positive;An absolute firework of special effects.
positive;Of course also an absolutely predictable love story must not be missing.
negative;Furthermore, the end is disheartened on the whole line: everything suddenly takes a good end – naturally completely surprising – that no one could have guessed...
positive;Perfectly flummed and staged re-launch of the series, in which even the humor in the just right dose is not missing - we can look forward to more!
positive;Music only occurs when someone in the film turns on the radio or the turntable.
positive;In the whole a very good comedy, which you should definitely look at.
negative;If two more films are filmed, that won't be enough.
negative;To squeeze it out in school notes: It is as if you had first written a 2, then a 4 and finally also a 6!
positive;but who fan and as a small child already could inspire for the two monkeys^^ will be completely satisfied!
negative;The film is by no means weak, but not more than average.
positive;Nevertheless, I had to grin almost continuously about this genius, especially Charly drew me into his spell.
positive;==References====External links==
positive;However, this topic made sense in the endeavor of Bond films according to the possibility to offer up-to-date time.
positive;The vocal inlays are excellent, stinging through a co-reisende staging.
positive;Even if Praunheim as in many of his other film is also present here as a protagonist, so in the course of the film this becomes increasingly incidental.
positive;Absolute highlight of course the final showdown against the devil himself.
positive;Both films have their reason for being, as the opening of the story conveys a completely different feeling.
negative;"Only a few ""highlights"" (I can only call them because of the fact that the rest of the film is just fad) such as Marcellus's saying (""I'm working on you with a solder lamp"") or Butches' saying (""I'm an American, there names don't have a deeper sense"") save the film for me personally from the total crash."
positive;The darker atmosphere and especially the absolutely grandiose performance of the two young actors.
positive;Ignorants!
positive;Unbelievers have no Bible knowledge.
negative;Unfortunately, it doesn't play in the cinema anymore, but it's really great!
negative;the end also very good!
negative;2.
positive;Sure, he's not everybody's business, but anyone who stands on movies like The Wedding Crasher or the classic Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas will certainly be laughing at this movie.
negative;Even I as a woman must confess that the men in the film are kept very small.
positive;e.g. snapes reminders or harry and dumbledore in the entrance hall to the beyond... for that the film took time, and that was a very big plus!
negative;I mean, Seymour didn't even get the chance to show off.
negative;"""The sensitive Chris would break up at the break-up and yet he can't help but continue to work for McCauley and indulge in gambling addiction."""
negative;Film-noirish to hitchcockmÃ1⁄4g, worth a look, though none of the very big bringers from his time.
positive;It's not a good idea.
positive;Also they were not so much convinced by the still unknown Al Pacino.
positive;The film is shot at a remarkable pace.
negative;Even though the actor performance was partly solid, the film was not saved.
negative;The idea is also good looking.
negative;The hint to the end, what could have happened to Jimmy, throws then any message, which the whole movie long before long breathed was propagated again over the pile.
negative;All in all, a tedious, boring movie (and we had not expected any action or similar).
negative;In my opinion, partly yes, but there's still air up there.
positive;But with Harry, I'm out of my mind.
negative;That, in my opinion, is the worst work of tim Burton.
negative;the movie is soooo bad.
positive;Big movie theater what awaits you here!
positive;Thanks Peter!
positive;Fans should not miss the edit Ulysses Cut.
positive;At the same time, Burton, however, in his own way would like to bring old-fashioned Horrofilms and brings gothic, loud and bloody horror to the screen, especially in the opening scene as well as in the apocalyptic showdown.
positive;At @Andreas now calm down again, okay?!
negative;5.
negative;"In addition, it doesn't seem so overloaded stupid and cheap as with ""Batman V Superman""."
positive;After Jurassic World I try again as a film critic.
positive;Thus, the father figure would be much more than a disguised alien - the incarnation of a being that has access to all the thoughts and ideas that ever existed in the universe (or, even more metaphysical: a being that, as a kind of world spirit, encapsulates all these thoughts and ideas).
positive;Again and again indications appear, which he cannot interpret.
negative;"Both of them don't work together and the result is such a bumpy screenplay disaster as in the last ""007-films""."
positive;This is basically quite simple (at least nothing really new), but delayed and somewhat chaotically told, so that the spectator is kept in a spell.
positive;this movie is just class he is the first in the series that is always thirsty and does not try to make everything as child-friendly as possible why he is one of the best of the series
positive;I think this film is awesome because it speaks out many things he everyone has in himself, it is very strongly inspired by the manga and the anime, which is rare in film adaptations of the kind.
positive;I also love problem films, film noir and similar, but: This is loose, airy, casual.
positive;one of the best films by Takashi Miike not a pure action film but rather an action drama: a worth seeing film that hollywood can never shoot
negative;The film is very calm, but then increases until it loses tension again after some time.
negative;I'll stay with the books.
positive;Leave this movie where it is!
positive;And the New Death Slow is the best action movie I've seen in the last few years.
positive;Great!
negative;This is now a big negative point.
negative;"The teacher's dramatic gestures and final rhetoric just before the end does not fit in with the much too short and much to ""simple"" development."
positive;There is not too much action but also not too little, everything very balanced.
negative;Side-by-side.
negative;Also temporary impotence with superheroes is thematized, here should be shown us that the man is deeply controlled by his vulnerable psyche and under circumstances a latex-kostÃ1⁄4m with action-prelude to increase his manhood necessary.
negative;"So that one gets to hear then in the Hanebüchenden finale also such completely rÃ¶tselhaft attributes like ""family"" and ""friends"" to hear."
positive;As in almost every of Burton's productions, the environment (as well as the actors through their specially designed exterior) seems almost surreal and thus very mysterious.
positive;The film is continuously exciting and provides with a light breeze healthy humor for some laughs.
positive;Unfortunately, I noticed some times negatively because the first meeting at the airport is simply overplayed although I can't imagine the Godzilla would let this escape so easily or the Mato was out on the same.
positive;If then one like him is suddenly nominated for a Golden Globe, one listens already.
positive;The staging is captivatingly precise, the film over 2 hours not only exciting, but also emotionally gripping.
positive;He shows what war makes of people and how it changes them.
negative;even if the acting performance of the two main characters is still so good, the film itself is not.
negative;The charm of a Terence Hill as well as some interesting side characters let me watch the movie completely and made the experience more than lost time.
negative;"In this film, 80% of the film took the said ""starting phase""."
positive;It's worth seeing.
positive;I hope for more parts.
positive;Even 24 hours after looking, I think back again and again.
positive;"Star Wars would not be Star Wars without ""The Return of the Jedi Knights"" and all three parts are, as it were, the best films of all time."
negative;You can't be serious.
negative;Elysium on the other hand: cliché, banality, unexciting.
positive;The pictures are impressive and very meaningful, the stars convince in their roles as four drug-dependent individuals, who go towards their demise.
negative;Density plot, suspense, action and an outstanding lead actor.
negative;the film plays in the year 2035, the protagonists are already in the middle 30, but besides smith often does not want any clue what happened in the 2000s, very unrealistic!
negative;Both very original and funny.
positive;Hello I can not sit differently: the film is a classic.
negative;So, if I want a well-staged chase, I'm looking at the classics like Bullitt, Ronin and also Taxi 1 from me, but this is really just bad.
negative;"In the run-up, I read things like ""Virtual Masterpiece"" or ""A 3D Experience"" and thought to myself the film is certainly not that bad."
positive;Funny remake with a cool cast and a lot of joke!
positive;My tip: go there, look forward to stubborn winegrowers who love their land and their vines.
positive;When I suddenly realized that Josh Hartnett was doing something together with Bruce Willis and was on a merciless revenge campaign, I was more than convinced of Hartnett's portrayal.
positive;"After reading the reviews, I'm surprised which polarization spotial is apparently ""Sin City""."
positive;But up to this point the movie was easier only great, and knows to inspire with many Stromberg typical laughs!
negative;Of course, the image of the male role and female role (unfortunately) is almost still so everywhere, but a slightly different view on it would have been already good.
positive;Yes, the story presses on the trance - but in a positive sense.
positive;"Two further changes are also based on taste criticism: On the one hand, the new â€"" better â€"" special effects."
positive;The two convince as enemies, partner-reciprocal will but also as first signs of sympathy between the figures flash up.
positive;Especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johanson!
positive;Doesn't matter there otherwise heart, feel ect.
negative;I wanted a little brainless action and got what I expected.
positive;You're always reminded that it's fiction.
negative;Nothing!
positive;Overall, I left the cinema hall in spite of higher expectations satisfied and with desire for more.
positive;The film strengthens an incredible mood, a bloody freedom, between danger and omnipotence fantasies, as if de Palma had filmed GTA in the eighties - only without the open end, but with the logical consequence, the insane scream, which echoes so long, until out of the mouth no more words, but blood.
negative;Puts everything there that runs wrong in the modern media world.
positive;"About ""Psycho"" everything has already been said what needs to be said."
negative;still one lives.. in my opinion would then perhaps someone noticed that it is only a bad game..would only be logical or?
positive;Story, humor, actor, logic, red thread etc. For me a milestone in film history and probably the best movie I've seen so far!
positive;The ability to immerse yourself in a fantastic story and to experience a wonderful fairy tale...!
positive;The film confirms in all respects that also the foreign iridian can develop further and adapt to the present time.
positive;Step up was a very nice drama in which a street boy with the prima ballerina becomes a super pair.
positive;"With ""Following"" Christopher Nolan has succeeded in a really excellent Noir thriller, which radiates a very special atmosphere precisely because of its low-budget production."
positive;If you're a TMNT fan.
positive;And it was breathtaking.
positive;One of the saddest.
negative;Hardly tension, extremely stupid characters and an incredible story
negative;The dialogues were unfortunately often flat and unconnected, a few of them unexpectedly clever.
negative;Even a few more into the air-scattered gravestones then the whole thing would be a little more exciting.
positive;A (not necessarily new) but very well implemented story, filled with great actors.
negative;A collection of uninteresting persons (type of bull stallion), entangled in a spun constructed case, which also does not bring much.
positive;I have to say that the German/Austrian cinema (Weingartner is more or less rich) can surprise me again and again.
positive;Every single film a small masterpiece - connected only by the theme, the love - and the city that gives the film the title.
positive;"Conclusion: ""Hostiles"" is hard, sad, extremely tiresome, calm, unsparing and leaves one still before the credits."
negative;Actors' performances are solid, no outliers up or down.
positive;It is to be said that it is perhaps the best Star Wars part that lives through the humanity of the individual character, the old flair and the new story about power.
positive;The bottom line is The thing from another world is a creepy, exciting, bloody and action-packed splatter shocker old school that lets you freeze the blood in your veins.
positive;The Jackie Chan movies have never had a great or deep story â€ , this one neither.
positive;Beautiful that there are still such films with such cast!
negative;Too often and never well filmed.
positive;Even if the film is technically not outstanding, it has interesting dialogues & brings you to think.
positive;Especially the point, one knows how it really was, but if one imagines the situation from the point of view of an inhabitant, wouldn't one have exactly these prejudices?
positive;Good call!
positive;What was very beautiful was where the bright coffin was opened and the clearing had such a beautiful light.
positive;"But one thing clearly shows ""The Wild Bunch"": violence fascinates above all else."
positive;AtmosphÃ¤re: Here the film scores on the whole line!
positive;I don't want any of you ever to come into such a situation and sell your soul.
positive;The opening scenario must swallow the audience like Sandra's pills.
positive;"In any case, this film is a very successful spectacle, which not only makes up the perfected visual style, but also that this story is exciting, creative and very nice to harmonize with the matching black/white, so that a very horny mood arises and maintains a certain kind of ""Sin City"", but there is a bit more comics in it, which should not have a negative effect on this movie or even on ""Sin City""."
positive;I've seen the film in New Zealand in English.
negative;But for what also, the figures are so and so only empty sleeves.
positive;Because what we see today as a succession of high-grade clichés was born here!
positive;While the machines around them reproduce the documents, they have something unique.
positive;The story is very thin.
positive;"""Into the Abyss"" is more appropriate."
negative;The action goes through just as much though far too little of it is shown.
positive;There are no real lengths, the soundtrack is fantastic, you will simply 111 minutes really well entertained.
positive;On the other hand, a version with a dissolving twist might be too classic and not as artful.
positive;In the leading role Nicolas Cage, very well done (!
positive;Conclusion: Really worth seeing funny comedy
positive;The light, loose staging as well as the naturally sloppily (but not unlevelless) theme worry that one and a half hours as in flight pass and you also have to laugh about the more often (with the scene in the Kinsey family sitting at dinner and Kinsey discussing detailed sex topics with woman and children is so terrible that you want to sink under the table).
positive;The night shots are very exciting, whereby it is mainly the own expectation attitude, which allows one to freeze in the cinema seat.
negative;In the end, he's the hero.
negative;the good old game which the camera does not show, you don't see / hear either!
negative;Unfortunately, the film is not particularly convincing in its style.
positive;What emerges on the screen are dream fantasies, visions and illusions.
positive;You should definitely look at it.
negative;Tomb Raider from Roar Uthaug is trying to make Lara Croft a normal young woman and I have to say that I find this completely bland in a jump-and-run action cracker.
positive;I have the film and can judge it better for me.
negative;==References====External links==
positive;"I saw ""Looking for Eric"" yesterday in the Sneak and can say that the film-starts-critic has captured this film very well."
positive;The actors completely convince.
negative;There are quite some good gags and allusions, but above all there is lack of tension, which I still felt in the preview films: Never the preparation of the robbery seriously in danger, every problem is quickly solved, serious antagonists are missing.
positive;Of course, a special, filmic emulation effort is provided for this.
positive;"I also think that word of mouth ultimately is much more positive than the ""official"" criticisms did at the beginning."
positive;the 'murder' who are actually 'suicides' are anything but ingenuity gorehappen.
negative;"At Friday Night Lights there was only one question at the end, was the \""based on a true event\"" at the beginning the legitimation for an unspectacular movie?"
positive;of horror films there is a wide range.
positive;Episode 1 was great and episode 3 was great.
negative;So we have a lot of clichés in action, adventure and romance.
negative;"Especially creepy were mainly not the ""shock"" moments, but the logic holes."
positive;Why wasn't Matt Damon arrested at the funeral?!
positive;Overall, I am more than satisfied with the result, even if it might not be so.
positive;So the two of them set out to the far north and it's all different than expected.
positive;The actors are convincing in their role, something that in such a film necessarily belongs to it and is important.
negative;Known actors in a gangster comedy where the certain something is missing.
positive;"Anyone who is otherwise afraid to be tormented with the depiction of mass murders as in ""Blood Diamond"", is hereby reassured."
positive;A father who absolutely wants to fight is like a lion for his children, and it gets tough because Dad has nothing else to sell.
positive;Of course, the African culture is interwoven in the film.
negative;blöd, as I find it, is then also still, if mann this film style still mixed with high-gloss shots, which atmospheric could not be more atmospheric.
positive;The representation of the pictures are also a class for itself.
positive;Normally, I'm so cold, but I'm not in the movie.
positive;"A very good film, which shows simply the real reality in the largest Camorra quarter of Naples; there reigns the highest drug use worldwide, all drug addicts from the region come there by bus!"
positive;And here, too, there have been great fluctuations.
positive;Only the end didn't quite promise me.
positive;"Just in advance : Michael Bay told me nothing- ""The Rock"" (pension solidarity surcharge for Mr. Connery otherwise dull command soldiers bullshit) and ""Armageddon"" (voluntarily overlaid, unrealistic asteroid hero saga) whereas already."
positive;Large breather breaks are not allowed, as the tension from the evil beginning to the bitter end is held extremely high.
positive;I'm sure Tim Burton's films aren't everybody's case, but I really liked Dark Shadows.
positive;But with the bride - ingenious.
positive;Sounds complicated, so it is in some scenes.
positive;Generally, the bridge function between parts 1 and 3 was exemplary.
positive;I have to admit, I guessed a little bit in that direction, but until the penny fell right, it took a while.
positive;also the cast with Jake Gyllenhall is very suitable in my opinion anch.
negative;However, there are only two of them in the whole film and thus are far from enough to roam around the rudder to create several WOW moments.
positive;And Tilda Swinton - How did you get old, Tilda?
positive;Only the claustrophobia in such a hollow system is brought over well.
positive;!It's just TOL!!!!
negative;If you can look, you don't have to.
positive;Or the intersequences during the occlusal lesson at Snape.
positive;I wonder what all the critics have ridden so badly.
positive;I just think she's awesome.
positive;Style break in which the journalist Robert Graysmith presents as an identification figure.
positive;The Driver is a very good movie, because the actors have been carefully selected.
positive;There is absolutely nothing wrong with camera guidance and sound.
negative;E.g.: Little Heinrich, (the name is already somehow a prejudice) who with Hitler's gruesome masks through the area.
positive;The movie is just awesome!
positive;The outrage of Mazursky is verbally funny, in English as well as in German, whether this is funny or not against the background of the missed chance to get his brother back!
positive;And as far as the legendary shooting is concerned, I must say that I have probably never seen anything better staged!
positive;Gary King lives in the past, he can't let go.
positive;It's a pure entertainment movie for not even a whole 90 minutes.
negative;However, he had never done everything, so far he was only responsible for the beautiful Baiser hood camera technology, but here we want to try his ability as a baker/director.
positive;Simply brilliant and colossal.
negative;"Since ""Shaun Of The Dead"" England has experienced something like a little horror boom."
negative;The rather interesting story was ruined by an action overkill.
negative;"Those who have never really been interested in good dialogues, interpersonal relationships, character depth and acting performances in a war movie, and who only liked the first 20 minutes of ""The Soldier James Ryan"", will certainly find the film good."
positive;Disney's going after him.
positive;It's incredible how much joke, charm and action little Ireland can bring!
positive;All this is more or less mouth-appropriate portions from the comics, also prepared for non-connoisseurs understandably and a little less tension.
positive;On the contrary.
positive;elementary particles is to be mentioned in a series with such ingenious new German films as Herr lehmann or 23. ok, the film should probably run under FSK-16.
negative;THE SINGLE WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BET OUT OR INCOME.
positive;So look successful new episodes of a series, carefully develop the figures, introduce a good and matching story and new Twists and figures for further episodes - which will hopefully exist, with Alicia Vikander naturally.
positive;"And everyone should always remember: ""We are all steaks!!!"""
positive;Thank you.
positive;Only the figure Drax would not have to be so flat.
positive;They are for me the basic requirement in a good comic.
negative;As not to be expected otherwise, the first part is by far the best!
negative;The film is a self-contained product and must not expect any further requirements from the viewer.
positive;The film is very attached to its original and also surprises with some very good shock moments.
positive;And there you would like to see such films again nowadays, even if you could find Hitchcockâ€TMs dream of a phone booth setting in â€œNot to hang upâ€œ a few years ago.
positive;But it was only well-pressed how quickly people will be carried with them every blow of such a thing.
negative;Part of it's okay.
positive;Kitano plays his Yakuza role perfectly.
positive;The story has become really exciting thanks to the script.
positive;the actor warns well, the action super (fingers in the sore), and the special effects did not seem put on as in many other films.
positive;or because many family in Hirushima have disabled children, and everything just because America plays out as world police ..
positive;The film never loses respect for the characters shown and refrains from evaluating its protagonists.
positive;"Conclusion: ""Sweeney Todd"" is a film, far away from the mainstream and very unconventional."
positive;but when you see the film you are often really excited.
positive;The music is as always with a star wars movie mega good, but frankly I lacked this main music of star wars.
positive;As a result, Bigelow does not stage like an Activision developer and does not write Boal like Trivialliterat Dan Brown.
positive;However, Reynold's variant does not lack individuality, instead of wanted love stories, the uncertain situation in the Roman province is in the foreground here.
positive;I recommend this film to everyone: It is an important part of the history of the Third Reich (alongside all the crimes committed), which everyone should also know.
positive;"""Similarly ingenious as the predecessor."
positive;Still, more of it!
positive;He meets the young Yuri, who lives by a river with her husband off the village, and recognizes his missing friend in the husband.
positive;But then Kenai meets the little cuddly bear Koda who is looking for his lost mother.
positive;==References==
positive;Until questions such as â€œWhere do you come from?â€œ and â€œWhat do you want here?â€œ can be brought to the SiebenfÃ1⁄4er and Dr. Banks can come into the use of a certain gift, a lot of time passes, but at Villeneuve - as usual - without boredom.
positive;The idea was innovative and brilliantly implemented.
positive;The film has a tpyan episode film concept (which resembles that of Magnolia), a rather quiet film tempo and many cliché-laden characters.
negative;The last point, however, is that I could hardly recognize any film music that could contribute to a bearing epic effect in terms of visual events.
positive;The film is part of a classic road movie.
negative;There's nothing more to expect.
positive;Otherwise, it'd be kind of stupid, wouldn't it?
positive;You just have to get in there, he's got everything a movie needs.
positive;Exciting, feeling, funny, witty and super Characktere!
positive;It's hard to tell what's brilliant about the movie and why I value it so high.
positive;"But Tarantino's latest work not only unites the forces from ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"", it also shows completely new things."
positive;Just like the special effects: nothing superior but ok.
positive;Roadmovies get something magical when they're done well.
positive;It contains the synchro of the series, which in my opinion is much more sympathetic than the old (even if it was not bad).
negative;Too bad!!!!!!!
positive;The film is rather trivial and nothing seems to be close to horror, but it gradually develops into an extremely perceptive and poignant psycho thriller, whereby at the end of the movie one wants to rage and immediately intervene in the plot.
positive;"I personally found that ""Das Bourne Vermächtnis"" is a successful film.Although the film has a few flaws, but which action film doesn't have it?"
positive;KLAR santi is not MARADONNA and anyone who kicks can do it the same (or almost*gg*) as he BUT is not about it.
positive;In war, the murderer becomes a hero.
negative;Unfortunately, the development of the characters is not as successful as in the first part.
positive;The start is the target.
negative;I loved the atmosphere and logic of this science fiction universe.
positive;Despite all the reviews, I have to say, the film is very worth seeing.
positive;The rough and partly dreary beauty of the Highlands.
negative;Sorry but the movie is just bad!
positive;In addition, the film does not have pop culture references and lives from its semi-wisdom quiet, otherwise unobtrusive and cute humor.
negative;In short, I decided to go into the movie and then decide how I felt about the new style.
negative;The spectator can't get into it properly, the characters at once seem quite superficial and besides, there's not much to admire outside of the beautiful environment.
positive;So I found the film quite well done, but is much better implemented by the plot like the Red Flood.
positive;Those who like humor and action strips will get their money's worth.
positive;The characters act so comprehensible and are so powerless.
positive;For 9/10?
positive;My potential doubts about the graphics of the HFR 3D were swept away and suffocated in the bud.
positive;In some places one feels the impotence of this father, when he seems to bounce off at authorities or entire judicial systems, as on an impenetrable wall.
positive;I mean the harmless movie turns from the entertainment movie into a, while looking closer thinner fable.
positive;- Realism, dirtyness and coolness.
positive;Jimi is just great!In the first part he was good, in the second he was better and in the third best!The wild guys are at all simply coooooooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative;What's he trying to tell us and show us?
positive;A single fate though, but representative and symbolic for many others.
negative;The gangster comedy is really nothing special.
negative;So, guys, please enjoy it with caution.
positive;"In the eternal comparison between ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" I take a stand for the candidate, which I also noticed when looking again at ""Casino""."
positive;The description looks like a lot.
positive;"TARANTINO IS OUR MAN; FOR RIGHTLY AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AFTER AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AFTER AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF A F AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF AF A"
positive;Robert Downey Jr.
negative;The only thing that can damage is possibly the scenes in which Dastan jumps in time or the good panoramic images.
positive;Ten points from me!!
positive;The movie just doesn't get bored.
positive;At last nothing is held back.
positive;The camera work knows how to please, but - this is probably due to the low budget - hardly an outstanding picture.
positive;I found the movie very good.
positive;Human, romantic, realistic and dreamlike about mimics and gestures.
positive;Kylo, on the other hand, is like Anakin Skywalker, who likes to freak out and is still afraid.
negative;For me, the film is simply a loose, unspectacular plot with lots of blood, which is probably the only thing that should attract the viewer.
positive;"A Western comedy for friends of the rather harsh humor; 60s spaghetti westerns meets 90sSplattermovie meets 70s-Exploitation."
negative;but also here bay plays his cards.
positive;The role of the author is outstandingly portrayed by Sir Michael Caine.
positive;At first as with most thrillers everything starts harmless but on the high point it becomes really ACTIONREICH.
negative;In some settings I almost fell asleep and that, although I'm not usually a movie closeer.
negative;It is technically good, the effects are worth seeing, the actors a class above the script.
positive;==References====External links==
positive;An absolute sci-fi masterpiece.
negative;Why is Kylo Ren a joker?
positive;"For a long time no one has been so gorgeously mean, and his character and his appearance as well as his motivation resemble the one of Prince Nuada from ""Hellboy 2 - The Golden Army""."
positive;Although at first it was difficult for me to think into the film, because it plays long before my time ^-^ and then also in France.
positive;So the movie was good.
negative;Conclusion: Laues LÃ1⁄4ftchen with unsympathetic main character!
positive;He looked a little cheap, though, had only a marginal appearance.
positive;In my opinion, almost everything in the movie fits.
negative;If then to the end men with dogs and in love couples run wild through the bet, with the aim unknown is emotionally already lost all hope.
negative;Gosling, which I really like to see, remains pale and shows the whole movie about actually almost only one and the same facial expression.
positive;Forget Jason Statham this movie surpasses every movie he has!
positive;Fans of Denzel Washington will get their money's worth.
positive;I actually went with no big expectations of the movie, because I had never heard of the movie before.
negative;157 minutes of high tech scrap in gamer format are a single insult to the completion of this trilogy.
positive;Watchers or players, give risky tasks or take risks to us to win money.
positive;So lovingly made, and only this synchronisation, .... that only strikes you at the higher age, which meaning nevertheless this grandiose synchronisation bore ... Great class, my children I will show this movie at any time also sometime , ha !
positive;The only thing that shocked me was the end because it wasn't really about the book but that doesn't have to be bad... Anyway it's worth watching the movie in the cinema !!
negative;Above all, this is simply because the production had far too little time.
positive;His son understands, the daughter doesn't.
positive;Had a few legs and Christoph Waltz seemed occasionally involuntarily funny.
positive;tja it was not a revelation. it was a masterpiece what david o russel put down there. shame that he did not win an oscar. the story is really good and the show-pilerric performance is also ingenious criminal film or comedy whatever that is just recommended.
positive;"Underworld, Resident Evil, etc. also have no ""cruel moments""."
positive;Tim Burton hit again.
negative;The action does not even reach the level of the first two parts.
positive;And both together make it happy.
positive;The humor seems sometimes emboldened and tense and also no longer clearly funny.
positive;"But it was also a bit funny that the mother Justin constantly addressed with ""scarts"" or ""favorite"", as if he were her son."
positive;I did not read a book by Sherlock Holmes before and did not continue to deal with this person.
negative;His â€ ¬¶sewichtâ€ is more than overexhaustible, he would actually have been able to be completely removed from the film.
positive;"What I particularly liked about ""Phantastic animal beings and where to find them"" was the first half of the film when the viewer was overwhelmed with surprises."
positive;After reading most of the reviews here in the forum, I found that most people here are dissatisfied with the fact that the film is not very close to the book.
negative;Built in 1950 and 1954.
positive;"All in all, ""The State Enemy No. 1"" is a really captivating and gripping high-voltage thriller that remains exciting until the last minute!"
positive;Then he goes down to his old department.
positive;"Inside Hollywood with Robert DeNiro or Sofia Coppola's latest work ""The Bling Ring"", Hollywood apparently tries to give insights into the world of stars."
positive;Film art and acting excellence.
negative;The movie offers a lot of action and car chases, but that alone is not enough for me.
negative;The film was really nice to see that the budget was drastically shortened against the previous one.
positive;Even as a police officer one can devote only the best praise to the film, I hope, Lisa Wagner still often has the possibility to deliver such a thing.
negative;the characters in this movie could also be porn actors without honor code see raping scene.
positive;what is only very important is to let the animals live in their peace as well.
positive;All of this is based on a 16 volumes comprehensive book series, so there is a lot of material available to let this movie figure go into a long series.
positive;Anna would be well advised to listen to her skeptical uncle, who would encourage the dead to bury their dead.
positive;Only I would like to say that there are very drastic reductions that are difficult to digest, which leads to the fact that it is not a normal love drama.
positive;The optics is also the hammer again and the effects even more.
positive;Really very cordial.
positive;I love Christian Bale.....he's just great....and I love Christopher Nole....he just makes great movies.....the story is made like for cinema.....fantastico
positive;If you're allowed to be a patriot, I guess it's in these cases.
positive;8/10
negative;But to convince the ideas.
negative;I can't remember much more, but I also had to force myself to do the 1.5 hours.
positive;However, communication problems are the central theme of Babel, which already gives rise to the title, which refers to the Tower of Babel.
negative;"I looked at ""Hitch"" in the movies a few weeks ago and found it rather boring."
positive;But only until then.
positive;First cream.
positive;Abrams surpasses himself with the second part and you only wait eagerly for his next project - Star Wars 7
positive;Ok, I still find the main characters still rotten, but also this time the penguins are the secret stars (doesn't least because they are again spoken of by the fantastic 4).
positive;So I have to honestly say that this was one of the best movies in recent years.
positive;:-) Is it a women's movie?
positive;Although I had to hold my ears (and also my eyes in some scenes) with every second word that the actors gave me, the film nevertheless inspired me.
positive;However, I found it very good, but also somehow very sad in some places.
positive;...when I read the last comments here.
positive;Black-and-white images with sharp contrasts and crazed colour swabs as well as the perfect camera work, which would have earned an Oscarnomination, make each individual setting a small work of art.
negative;I have to say that pig is actually only side-by-side and can well also be completely omitted.
negative;I can see this more neutrally: it's just a cinematic spinning over a funny chew that makes its surroundings palpable with its blooming imagination.
positive;Thank you!
positive;Cameron Diaz is incredibly serious and professional.
negative;Not only that many owls simply look too much, but rather the inexplicable multiplicities of the forests are easy to overlook.
negative;Some nice effects and that's it.
positive;Exciting and lively film..... Definitely recommended!
negative;Only worthwhile on the film are the few, but impressive large shots of the island of Iwo Jima while it is shot by the Americans (great special effects).
positive;Sarimaus
positive;"However, I only gave 9 because some scenes are quite unfaithful (why do the Trojans not just stay behind their ""strong walls""??"
negative;Greetings?
positive;Then, contraryly, one puts oneself in the rage of the tortured and would like to call her a kellen.
positive;Great soundtrack and excellent played and staged
negative;The personalized body is back again and does once again what it apparently can best: against a meanwhile fifth-class (?!)
negative;He's just not an actor.
positive;(b) The following shall be added to the list of products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009:
positive;It's just wonderful.
negative;But I would have expected a little more or one would have been able to get more out of the basic idea of the film!
positive;In 90 minutes an exchange year, with all obstacles, problems but also joy and satisfaction, is presented in a very entertaining way.
positive;But that pays off pretty well in the end.
negative;In just such is found a certain style will and atmosphere.
positive;"The ""standard interpreation"" of the dream is not enough for me."
positive;Rather, he strictly establishes an interpersonal story in an environment that does not seem so fictional to the viewer.
negative;Action scenes are then moved over, as long as their bond seems cool.
positive;During the dealer's visits to the film, the socio-critical aspect of the film comes into the background, and the trashy fun of unbecoming action is let loose.
positive;- a few spoilers_ whereby I find that you can spoil this movie without harming him.
positive;I was from the 1st century.
positive;I rarely recommend movies, as I find most for absolutely stupid and boring.
positive;For less is Luke hunted, but must rather see how one opposes him and shuts himself off.
positive;"only after hangover I saw then ""brüno"", which I found strangely funny (I know it is certainly not everybody's humor, but mine already), therefore for a short time this was the best comedie, until yesterday = zack & miri have shown me!"
positive;Also Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha with his marked oneliners play top.
negative;The actual story deals however with a war tragedy and with its effects on the bereaved.
positive;After I've walked about 500 meters, I see them, huge monsters.
negative;After that it is fortunately better, but never achieves the intensity of the predecessor.
positive;After I drove 180 km last weekend to see this film, which I find very regrettable on the one hand, the special character of the film on the other side by the traditional charm of that light play house far from CineStar and Co.
positive;Joss Whedon is a genius!
positive;As previously mentioned, the story is quite good and consistently interesting.
positive;"You don't have to say much more about this movie than ""Wayans Brothers"" !!!"
negative;Because this aspect has unfortunately been pushed far too much into the center.
positive;), the incredibly sympathetic characters, the great music, the exuberant cheerfulness that the film conveys â€¢ oh damn, I won't find the right words to logically express why the movie means so much to me, I just recommend it to everyone, even if most of them will dismiss it only as a completely insignificant comedy!Conclusion: For me the best, most early and most versatile party comedy ever!
positive;Especially Josh Brolin you see in the cinema more and more and he has an extremely high presence.
positive;I saw him once, I saw him twice... crazy movie.
positive;Sam Raimi's original was a real horror cult movie in my generation.
positive;This movie shows me again why Batman is my favorite comic hero.
positive;His story captivates with gripping and interesting twists which often appear unexpectedly and thus give the film a lot of effect.
positive;Or, everyone believed the Casino Royale with Daniel Craig can only get bad.
negative;Hi, everybody. I've seen T3 since yesterday.
positive;Only very rarely does a film manage to bring its statement so aptly, unobtrusively and entertainingly to the screen like â€žDallas Buyers Clubâ€œ: A fundamental plenipotentiary for more tolerance, more self-determination, but above all for more humanity.
positive;If you expect a thriller story or horror effects, you should stay away from this movie.
positive;Hicks, too, has changed significantly in the last years and he has become more mature, how should it be different, and has to accept himself so easily that he will step in the footsteps of his father, but really become friends, he still can't.
negative;Every now and then there are a few good laughs, but in the whole it is unfortunately in limits.
positive;To the first point: I do not need to explain here to anyone the genius and the prominent influence of the director on the posterity.
positive;Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the synchornization, because I only got the original DVD from the USA.
positive;This goes in some important scenes quite clearly at the expense of the emotionality and the empathic feeling.
positive;especially pleased me the young tÃÃ1⁄4rke burak.
negative;If you're not a Rocky fan, the movie won't bring you anything.
positive;"if McClane makes one by one of his people down, and makes him white with a few drinks (or should bring them) stirs up with this actor who encapsulates Thomas Gabriel just nothing... he doesn't build up anti-sympathy, nothing, the opponents of McClane you have always hated somehow, especially at 1 +3 Rickman and Irons were great, but this Olyphant is just bad and his whole ensemble is also, also the ""asia"" tante is completely boring or just boring...a pity, because good opponents are fundamentally important for a good hero."
negative;All in all, some kind of Pseude teen love drama you don't have to see.
positive;Better and more emotional it would not have been able to be implemented.
positive;So who argues so, has seen the film only to half?!
positive;bomb film but probably the worst syncronization of all time.
positive;You just can't hold the tears...
positive;The film shows a decadent world, which one neither understands nor wants to understand as a normal citizen.
positive;The film is peace and it shows us every minute, even if it throws us into a battle between Japanese and American, pantheism always pleads for peace in the film!
negative;or quite classical david against goliath.
positive;He makes me smile, even grin, but never loses a certain claim and from time to time he makes me very thoughtful, just to make me smile again.
positive;The complex plot is charged with the rousing and symphonic music of Nightwish, which lends poetry and beauty to darkness.
positive;I hope that the film reaches and teaches many people.
positive;I don't like it, but they fit here!)
negative;The problem here: If you really want to be brutal in the film, then the blood should also be sprayed properly, then a exaggerated ironic distance to the shown must become clear.
negative;Due to a high rating of filmstarts.de, which I usually trust to have a real impact, I did this movie to myself.
negative;I very much hope that 'The Purge: Election Year' (appears this year) will fill up my corners.
positive;Depp and Carter are great again, as well as the rest of the cast.
positive;SINGLE CLASS!
positive;"The scenario of the film reminds one of movies like Roland Emmerich's ""Independence Day"", ""The Contact"" or Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds""."
positive;The best films, in my opinion, are the ones that manage to create a unique atmosphere.
positive;It's amazing to watch the Norwegian film market.
positive;For example, Gandalf leaves the travel community for longer time in the book and is silent about his goals.
positive;Can't quite get to the second part, but it's not bad either!
positive;My revelation of the film is clearly Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, who with his scenes and views sounds like wanting to make election campaign for the Greens.
positive;A film, powerful and incisive like hurricane sweeping through an avenue of half rotted trees, a storm of images that won't let go of you for a long time.
positive;"In reality, no one would ever do that."""
positive;I find it could not be awarded better actors for these roles.
positive;See for sure!
positive;Who has already had the good to live successfully and carefree in life from birth.
negative;One must not forget that this is a children's film.The first part has done much more fun than the 2 and 3. But as with the movies so the sequels mean worse.I would buy it for my children but certainly not for me.
positive;Okay, the title isn't exactly the banger, but I still wanted to give the movie a chance.
positive;If that's not enough, let's say that a young talent like Mark Ruffalo shows himself from the best side in this film.
positive;The film gives you the feeling of a cult film and is in many places a Homage at old blockbusters and classics like E.T.. Small lengths are unfortunately present denoch.
positive;It just fits everything...it's already a work of art to go through the movie so geek-like over 2 hours and never lose the density of entertainment/voltage or comedy.
positive;"yes and sometimes think about his own life with the ""Plastic""."
positive;what lies at the end above all on the actors and dances.In this film everything is just right.
positive;!^^,I thought that the movie was totally long-sighted and so, abba then he was very good, the romantic places were the coolest!
positive;"""The marriage of the Templar Knights"" does his thing however very well!"
positive;"Lets his pioneers all stirred up and with the same fervour (you can sometimes even see the fire in McCougney's eyes directly) like the tech-enthusiastic ""We do this"" â€ ,68 generation start into space and search for the impossible."
positive;Unfortunately, the end for me is a bit too flat and therefore 1 star trigger!
positive;Excellent also the performances of DiCaprio and Foxx.
positive;Nevertheless, IpMan 2 is better than its predecessor.
positive;But here it was described without kitsch, without pathos, with realistic problems and multi-layered characters.
negative;That a film should somehow get away from the book and go its way can't justify it.
positive;When one of the students finally wants to take his life, Petra threatens to make the case public.
positive;Well, reaching a target group with this work is difficult: children will not understand the irony and side strokes, while older ones will be deterred from the child's style of drawing.
positive;Therefore, it is not surprising that he rather 'plays' with a guy interesting for him instead of hanging out with the boring gang members and gets angry when one takes away the toy from him.
negative;But that's a point of view.
positive;â€œPhantastic animal beings and where they can be foundâ€œ is well implemented, so that we felt right back into the magical world.
positive;And how human that is all.
positive;b) the much too early turnaround in the story, and that already after a little more than half of the film.
positive;"Chu manages to catapult a dance firework on the screen through the very convincing leading actors (especially Briana Evigan as ""Andie"" and Adam G. Sevani as ""Moose"") also through the good soundtrack (including Timbaland, Missy Eliott, FloRida and T-Pain)."
positive;"The sound of the film changes from exciting over dramatic to funny; each tone sits and this ensures a nice change."
positive;Always pre-emptive one likes comic films and especially the Marvel Cinematic universe.
negative;Everyone liked the movie.
positive;"He doesn't give the viewer an opinion, but instead lets him decide for himself what the viewer really holds in the ""fight"" against such a regime."
positive;"Maybe Luo Xiao Hu, the ""Black Cloud"", loves Yu Jen, but for Yu Jen this is not true, she fights (or just plays around)."
negative;There's no end-time mood here!
positive;Because in the media it's always about Tom Cruise Scientology getting better, etc. you forget about it.
positive;This movie is just awesome.
negative;This movie is o.A.
negative;I look forward to the sequel because of the gritty end, very critical.
positive;Very good movie about the difference between evening adventure and fatherland love.
positive;The number of spectators can also be seen worldwide.
positive;All in all a really beautiful comedy!
positive;However, I have a question for all those who have also seen the film: What is in the envelope that DiCaprio gives the psychologist before he disappears?
positive;No action bulwark is to be expected here.
positive;"I had expected a ""normal"" action film and was very positively surprised here."
positive;"However, the presentation of the film has succeeded quite well, even if someone who does not know the material can hardly understand the threat of a Sephiroth or Jenovas, because this is illuminated a little too little - absolutely before the actual movie on the bonus DVD ""Last Order""."
positive;Very good film from the 70s!
positive;The characters seem so real and although the whole plot could be regarded as something too playful, he spits the cold truth in everyone's face.
negative;The obligatory love cuddle is only an uninspired side action and the end is anything but surprising.
negative;The cinema was occupied by 30%.
negative;I personally would have wanted me a little more depth, moreover the characters could not convince me very much.
positive;In addition, he needs blood and at this point Larryâ€TMs trusted Julia comes into playâ€¦ You can find the complete review here:
negative;In addition, two excellent actors dress the two main characters.
positive;The film deals with the topic of immigration to the USA very differentiated and intriguing.
positive;However, the action scrapes a little bit of the credibility of the plot, when a somewhat treacherous policeman alone can turn off 3 bankers.
positive;The others also throw themselves full Lotte into the written words and thus a bitter, hard family drama arises that does not deliver optical display values, but emotional high points.
negative;Youth book adaptations are becoming more and more a genre of their own and, especially this year, they are growing extremely.
positive;In the foreground for humorous inlays is naturally Teddybär Ted.
positive;Now the side shows of the story and the seismicity at the beginning of the film give a meaning and contribute to the refinement of Jep Gambardella.
positive;A successful film with many exciting scenes.
positive;After the nevertheless rather dormant 2.
positive;That's all he said.
negative;The world-renowned mimes cannot play out their acting talent at all.
negative;Bourn is of course a very good example.
positive;Delicate guests and fans of superficial Hollywood movies with Happyend should make a wide bow around this film due to the partly violent representation of violence and the entire disturbing plot.
positive;have seen the film in Austria and am thrilled, although I don't usually make much of classical music
positive;I went into this movie with a lot of prejudices.
positive;In addition, the wonderful, meaningful pictures and the strong characters are another reason to watch this film.
positive;On the one hand, this would be a very good cast (Kevin Spacy as Lester Burnham), an excellent gripping story with many elements such as tragedy, drama and funny to satirical components.
negative;Talking?
positive;Effects?
positive;The refreshing dialogues, which were adapted from the novel by the neurologist Lisa Genova, also contribute to this.
positive;Violent Orgies: Braindead 120 Days of Sodom Cannibal Holocaust Cannibal Ferox Faces of Dead (all parts, despite fakes) etc Violent Films: Dance of the Devils Re-animator Zombi Woodoo Day of the Dead Kill Bill etc Rightly brutal Films: True Romance Running Scared Dawn of the Dead (2004) etc Average brutal Films: Pulp Fiction The Blob Scream (1+2) SchindlerÂ ́s List The Soldier James Ryan Dance of the Devil 2 etc Little Violence Pan's Labyrinth (!)
positive;You can't identify with any of the characters that remain very flat outside Yuri, his brother and the gunman Weisz.
positive;Shocking, exciting, top!
positive;All figures allow a look that excludes any sensation of artificiality.
positive;But for all those who want the slope to aesthetics the film is a must and is entertained pompously.
negative;Hold a typical straight-lined revenge and confusion strip without surprises with some neat action scenes, bigger story holes and a few very weak dialogues.
positive;3D, high frame rate.
positive;Highly recommended insider tip, the movie would have earned in my opinion far more viewers.
positive;Zoe â€žAnnamariaâ€œ Saldana (â€žFlight of the Caribbeanâ€œ) also plays a crucial role.
positive;Again, no Oscar.
positive;"And another thing, Filmstarts.de: ""Happy Gilmore"" is a masterpiece."
positive;The subsequent flight of the protagonists - also great, what do you want to deny?
positive;There are movies that are immediately a classic.
negative;Is there any left?
positive;A story with a lot of feeling, pleasure, love, joy and drama.
positive;The hundred-three minutes are twice as long!
negative;I always had the feeling that the half was missing here, which also led to the fact that for almost the entire second act I had no idea what was actually going on on the screen.
positive;Unfortunately, you have no idea at all of good movies and lots of them.
positive;Kim Basinger in ideal cast.
positive;Especially well worked out are the mimics of lions.
negative;Of course it is only a short film and of course it is a bit bizarre, but these 30 minutes did not address me at all.
positive;The film also shows a bit of the history of America.
negative;Only from the middle it becomes quite nice.
positive;If the film doesn't like it, it just didn't understand it or with the theme nix am hat the insiders know what is meant by the film and what is being criticized by it!
positive;It radiates an aura, a presence.
positive;So from me to all cases 8 points.
positive;Conclusion: Kramer's goal with this film is not in the foreground, but it is there.
negative;It's all just weird.
negative;I give this movie 5 points because some places are drawn into the lengths....
positive;Beautiful clear story so, which actually works without much draught and due to the slight irony nevertheless does not turn into a total trivial work.
negative;And at the end there is still Legolas, who seems to have mutated into the over-Elf.
positive;The rest of the characters are actually only there, get little characterization, but have quite a personality and so all goes well, especially since one has to do with a comic filming.
positive;Absolute recommendation.
positive;"Our laws make it so simple."""
negative;That's it.
negative;"And the consciously set scenes, such as those with his ""producers"" and those with Pamela (tells my grandmother that it was real)."
negative;I also thought the story was boring.
negative;So the movie is nothing whole and nothing half.
positive;The mental bonds to â€TMExcaliburâ€TM or the sleeping drink in â€TMRomeo and Juliaâ€TM do not at all interfere, but fit well into the picture, which is often held thirsty and thus creates the necessary atmosphere.
negative;I also saw this movie in the sneak.
positive;"For friends of crazy space movies, who do not take their own myth overly seriously, ""Valerian"" will prove to be a lucky grip."
negative;The presentation is quite ok, it is a glaring, sun-flooded film that the image â€žRomanzeâ€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â Â Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â€ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â€ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
positive;It's all about Bullock and that's right.
positive;Everything's just right in this movie.
positive;I'm more likely to hit the movie, and I was totally surprised how good it is.
positive;We see a troubled sun and swarming suburbs.
negative;Since I had set almost no claim to the film, I also have not been unmasked...but also not surprised.
positive;I find the idea of making a musical out of the fabric great.
positive;Garnished with action, great pictures and further approaches to family, the own self and medical/technical ethics.
positive;But also the uncertainty that he must sense, what may happen next in this atrocious destruction apparatus.
positive;I only saw this and the First Rambo part and this one really convinced me.
positive;nor did it surprise me, when I heard the continuations were almost torn apart by the criticism.
positive;Unfortunately, in my environment I know only a few who know how to protect this movie.
positive;Very cool and magical!!
positive;Because such scenes it has actually heartily little here, but nevertheless one gets as Gänsehautfan fully at its expense.
negative;Conclusion: I definitely hoped for more and am therefore already very disappointed.
negative;The main plot of history was so dazzling that the words would stay away from me.
positive;Such a movie is a happy case!
negative;I'd rather look at Mary Poppins!
positive;A film that I didn't expect very much in the past.
positive;(It is likely that the excessive proportion of sensitivities of some women should be encapsulated, but this is not particularly advantageous in the face of the apocalyptic threat from the living dead).
negative;That's why the end remains illogical that it's already shouting: Spoiler: Does the whole perfidious plan of the underground rest on the fact that the game director is a rebel, all those who were already thick before are under a blanket and the protagonist just at the right moment comes up with the idea to shoot an electric arrow at the dome, where then two minutes later a flying ship picks up the lady?
negative;However, one rejects then nevertheless willingly back, it happens over itself and maybe even against expectations a nice afternoon out of it.
positive;And especially his exaggerated ego with a tendency to self-sustainability and self-confidence, often brings him into trouble.
positive;Even in a torture scene, I couldn't resist it, and even though I'm not a fan of movies like Saw or hostel.
negative;"Then he is on the safe side with Gerard Butler in ""Olympus/London has fall""."
positive;So this time also on the margin still the happy name choice of the film is to be noticed, which is this time even in the actual as well as metaphorical sense logical.
negative;Sure the figure play great but sure figure play edgy.
positive;In addition, he has shown great courage with the end and set a sign that Disney is not just about love stories.
negative;Anyway, I would rather pump the money into the video library than go into this movie.
negative;Instead of the world of the computer (Tron 1) one has decided to encapsulate a simulated world (ala matrix), but why the hell does everything have to be so mechanical?
negative;I refer exclusively to Hans W. GeiÃ1⁄4endörfer's film adaptation of Thomas Mann's complex mammoth work, which I was allowed to attend as a pupil of the upper class in the class association in a Lichtspielhaus in Kassel.
positive;A reboot that made sense for once!
positive;Of course everyone has his own opinion but the special effects and the transformation of the kelia Ani to Lord Vader is simply bombastic!
negative;Perlman's still a good figure, but otherwise everything stays pretty pale.
positive;But this is never over and always fits into the situation, it simply results from the actions of the persons and this is a long-deadened art.
negative;The movie is good, has its interesting moments, but I have to say: There you can make a lot more of it!
negative;The story in itself sounds like a quick action or something like a video game movie in which a troupe of people fight through a utopian train, from compartment to compartment or from level to level.
positive;The positive points of criticism are the absolutely ingenious camera guidance, the impressive backdrop and the absolutely perfect implementation of the story staged on a true event.
positive;Due to the appearance of the Spaniards and the open question about their function, many possibilities are offered to the viewer to finish the film according to his own understanding of the Kulur.
negative;Have the requests of the corresponding editors by the Hollywood overkill already fallen so far?
positive;The movie is really mega!!
positive;You also notice to the main actor that they are in their element.
negative;No further development, confused, confused concept of life, desperate fight against age - so Woody Allen presents itself.
positive;The screenplay by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman bubbling over quotes, satirical allusions, reddish dialogues, cool onliners and takes all the comic films of the past with crazy and very unusual ideas on the brink that you simply don't come out of laughter again.
positive;The idea of such a terrible topic, as the murder of a boy with so much joke to put into effect is really bravely one can assume that there is only a creepy suffering of a movie out of it.
positive;All three leading actors play fabulously.
positive;"A really good movie with many twists and a completely untypical (and just because of that character-strong Bondgirl; only the dialogue between 007 and her in the plane - he had depth!)."
positive;This universe of the conquest of urban spaces in the center of a drama allows Florian Gaag to analyze graffiti more differentiatedly than this would ever be possible from the distance of the documentary filmmaker.
positive;The music also fits well into the film.
positive;In any case Tarantino has succeeded here a timeless masterpiece, that one should have seen at least once.
positive;I liked it so much and it made a huge fun to follow the movie.
negative;The beginning has been quite successful and makes you want more.
positive;"The United States of the future are degenerated into a surveillance state in which the problems are attempted by the consumption of the novel drug ""Substanz D"" (D for Death)."
negative;You don't get much smarter than what you learn in class and so the movie is unfortunately below average.
positive;Until the final happy end, he has statistically reduced the crime rate in Paris significantly and brought high economic activity to the Paris funeral institutes.
positive;Here as there is demonstrated a typical, normal morning at a school, one almost willfully and indiscriminately observes scenes of a very normal school day which are repeatedly shown from different perspectives so that at several intersections the scenes repeat themselves (in a scene, for example, a schÃ1⁄4ler sits on the school toilet and hears as in the neighboring cabin a passing, in the later course givesâ€TMs the scene again out of sight of the vomit).
positive;Also the conclusion leaves no wish open.
positive;Great.
negative;Since John Rambo, he's really been dating again.
positive;Although one can accuse the first battle scene of being arbitrarily motivated in its justification for existence, it clearly shows what The Raid 2 can do: Crazy camera rides in the narrowest space, incredibly dynamic pans and cuts, down to the perfection of movement and ingenious introductions within the fights.
negative;For me only a medium-sized comedy, tension goes against zero and the 1.5 hours came to me, exaggerated said as 3 hours ago.
positive;Recently, only a few films really impressed me, with which I could guide the plot in front of me the whole evening.
negative;Thought the movie would be more fun (the movie was also announced as a comedy).
positive;The film is so stupid that it's brilliant again.
negative;Written by: Marcin Dylong
negative;Unfortunately, the actors/figures are all interchangeable.
positive;X-Men 1 had to introduce all the characters, but now that this was done, it could really crash.
positive;The synchronous voices:PERFECT!
positive;An absolutely awesome movie, I have to admit, the best I've ever seen.
positive;I reject such an incorporation, without wanting to speak the word between individual and society to a natural and irrevocable antagonism, which always likes to train itself behind the back when people with their socialist ideals and visions – an inconsistency to intellectually clothe the concept of socialism – attract society as soon as they have come to power.
positive;The story would have been easily accommodated in a 90 minutes and in the 148 minutes that lasts â€œJackie Brownâ€ , there are neither particularly varied displays or constant surprises to be seen, rather Tarantino places increased attention on the figures and frees them of any imaginable space that the plot does not need.
positive;Man can simply immerse himself, as in a nightmare, but one that remains in memory and which one can experience again and again.
positive;But how this idea was implemented is simply awesome.
negative;Technically, the film is great.
positive;Above all things by the dense archetype of exciting film, but also in its representations and its implementation considerable.
negative;Otherwise, there is in particular for everyone who knows the fairy tale nothing new - but that doesn't make the movie bad.
negative;Who should ask, however, how one can write such a scrap, how one can film such a scrap and above all, why there are good actors who play in such a scrap, yes will probably not have found an answer to it up to now and I guess, not even in the future.
positive;to everyone: this film is absolutely great!!
negative;a big budget comedy with star array, but brazen, unpleasant, confused.
positive;Head cinema -with great pictures - will probably never have a big fan base
negative;A good (fight) movie, which advertises with Van Damme, but which appears quite rarely ^^ The training scenes are already cool made, nice trashig :lol: Otherwise everything is shitty here, only the fights are good!
positive;At home, this optical appeal is almost completely lacking.
positive;However, there was also the one or other scene that gives pleasure skin feeling when dome the
positive;It seems less put on than in the new Wall Street film, for example.
positive;Here we are clearly dealing with an action masterpiece.
positive;There's a person you're doing the tutorial with.
negative;I didn't find that exciting.
positive;I recommend the movie to anyone, whether comic fan or not.
positive;Even after a few sessions with Ava, he realizes that something is not going on with right things...
positive;These questions work out.
positive;: Nice that there are still Disney movies with the original setting.
positive;However, the role of Jesus deeply affected me.
positive;It's all about that: the actors, the conversations (Hello?
positive;"It happened in the nineties that screenwriter and writer William Goldman - who owes the film history masterpieces like ""Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid"", ""Marathon Mann"" and ""The Bride of the Prince""; also ""The Spirit and the Darkness"" and a cucumber like ""Dreamcatcher"" should not remain unnoticed (no one in the business has only good days) - created a script of exceptional quality in the quiet chamber."
positive;Who is looking for a complex story here is out of place.
positive;This is actually told in five minutes and the turns keep themselves also in limits, which I find very a pity.
positive;Evil'' Eli Craig has succeeded in a splatter comedy with pitch black humor, which is different (backwaterers are hunted by college students!
positive;Especially with the latter, this film is absolutely revolutionary, and impressive.
positive;It is logical to introduce an adversary against whom both will fight together!
positive;At the first encounter, Lionel places an involuntary stunt as he stumbles back into the roadway.
positive;Even computer animations serve a higher purpose here, i.e. a metaphorical (ant in subway).
positive;The priest belongs to the armed youths.
positive;Will Smith and Gene Hackman play their best roles here.
positive;Inglourious Basterds has become a really strong and once again typical Tarantino film.
positive;By the way, the German version is cut, which I can't understand, because I can't find it brutally at all.
positive;Rarely are filming better.
positive;Stunning.
positive;Although the third part is no longer quite as good as its predecessors, one takes nevertheless time, for the succession of the Corleone family.
positive;Ryan Philippe, just like Laura Linney, does his thing within the scope of the given possibilities very neatly, but one should be clear about it, that this film stands and falls in love with Chris Cooper.
positive;The religious connection between Judaism, Islam (islÄm / Ø¥Ø3) and Christianity was also interesting.
positive;The film has left in me a feeling of anxiety, especially because you have experienced the time so yourself.
negative;This movie didn't scare me for a second.
negative;How can one sympathize with such a ¶sewicht.
positive;"But I personally don't find out in what he differs so qualitatively from other films, because I lack the certain ""something"" with it."
positive;For what she sees are lies, deceit, and betrayal.
negative;Good approaches, bad implementation!
negative;Especially the stuttering actor seems unfaithful.
positive;For adult audience with slight splatter refining but definitely to recommend.
positive;That would have been much more elegant solutions.
negative;Neither does JOHN WICK with the women.
positive;The film captivates and sustains up to the last minute !
positive;The trigger is all at the end.
positive;The path from the monkey baby to the leader of the monkeys, this is simply a superb view of a character change that I have seen so, very rarely.
positive;Conclusion: An absolutely gripping drama from Russia.
positive;Surprisingly realistically depicted and very convincing.
positive;Masterpiece.
positive;Its overall back-up game is all the more haunting.
positive;diaz but this roll was your best!!
positive;"The figure Karl remains for me a purely asserted figure; and Hans seems to have no problems at all, a kind of Alexis Sorbas apparently, who wants to solve us petrified big city people from our everyday starvation."
positive;There are deductions with me for that phasewise the film has got a bit too long.
positive;Just come out of the movie and can certify this movie a status close to the genius.
positive;With Claudia I would like to thank for the reference to the German BBM forum.
positive;For me definitely the more frightening specimens of undead.
positive;yet a very, very big movie!
positive;I like Thomas Jane very much as an actor and I liked him in his role.
positive;And that's exactly where Borat starts.
negative;Story itself confusing.
negative;Nevertheless, anyone who likes Jean Reno may take a look.
negative;A few friends who want to climb a bit of a hollow, simply decide to step outside of their map into unexplored territory.
positive;Alex Garland, the author of filming books of remarkable films such as â€žSunshineâ€œ, â€žEverything we had to giveâ€œ and â€ž28 Days Laterâ€œ, sits on the director's chair for â€žEx Machinaâ€ for the first time and does not allow himself to write the script himself.
positive;Sometimes I was really shocked what I saw there and this documentary definitely left a lasting impression.
positive;That's great!
positive;I liked the second part even better than the first one, which was already extremely good.When I saw the film (part 1 u.2) for the first time I liked the first one better.However, V.Cassel promises an incredible charisma and convinced with absolute changeability.
positive;"This criticism is obvious to everyone, but in this film, not as in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"", is enjoyed by unequivocal dialogues, but rather by advancing the film in the interaction of the protagonist with its environment."
negative;Not bad but also not really good despite big names.
positive;The feeling and the performance of something truly terrible before, is planted at the beginning of the fillm really well into the viewer and forms the basis of the whole coming up film.
negative;- Many scenes from the trailers are missing: No cyborg that rises to the sky with full sight, no visit for Alfred, no flash of the shots of the paradoxes avoids and Cyborg also saves no police officer and the statement of Steppenwolf is missing.
negative;"If what is said, the most frequent answer is: ""aha"", ""good"", ""ok""."
positive;A shocked mother who seeks justice and takes unusual measures, this is already the whole approach to action with which I thought it was about being able to present a body at the end.
positive;There are always people in the movie who are only extras to be finally and finally killed.
positive;A very exciting scene.
negative;From 3-4 interesting aspects, a nearly 2.5h long, edifice, cliché-like, unfaithful, and at the end very low-idea-poor market was marketed here.
positive;He plays Oberhauser really cool and emotionless.
negative;"I have to admit, I was very surprised when I saw the trailer for ""Bedtime Stories"" for the first time in the cinema and also that he had not particularly convinced me."
negative;Much seems cheesy and far too far-fetched.
positive;But all the characters perform their role.
positive;For lovers of movies in black and white an absolute must.
positive;But anyway film is ultimately art and art is a subjective point of view.
positive;This is anything but a B movie.
negative;Every now and then the movie gets missed an emotional side, however, annoying in the end, since Smith plays the family father again!
negative;Of course there are a few messages at the end of the movie, but the movie doesn't have a really good story that is worth being told.
positive;Rather, it is about international cooperation, press, research and the handling of sensitive information in a world population that is close to panic.
positive;==References====External links==
positive;Look forward to more of him and of course R2 and 3Po
positive;What a grandiose film and those will be surprised now, that I dedicated myself to such a film, however, has itself, there something surrendered, where I did not believe myself.
positive;I also ask that with a possible successor Joss Whedon be obliged again.
positive;Because I just can't introduce Brosnan or even Connery as 007 in the most exciting scene of the movie.
negative;The story is just too flat.
positive;- I'm fine.
positive;Conclusion: An aesthetically unbelievably ingenious psychothriller with a surprising developments, but smaller battles in detail, which go directly to the detriment of the behavior of the characters.
positive;The only red thread in the story remains the Doc with his spliff.
negative;Conclusion: Loud and spectacularly opened, but made in a penetrating way to the franchise!
positive;"The fact that the cause of the relationship crisis of the American couple (your third child died on the so-called ""early child death"".)"
positive;";)"
positive;The other actors are like in the series & in the end it will be a bit overpowered, but nevertheless related to the reality!
positive;There is plenty of tension.
negative;Boah, was that a gray last night!
negative;You can see immediately what was real and what was created in the computer.
positive;excellent enemy are the borgs, which represent something completely new in the oh so sucked-out feindefundus hollywoods.
negative;So maybe it was the synchronization, but I think I was rarely as negatively impressed as after this movie.
positive;In the Neusynchro...naja highest 4/10 I know: It is very spleenig already to make that so much at the synchronisation... but please...?!?!
positive;Barber sends his leading actor Michael Caine as revenge angel Harry Brown on the hunt for the drug dealers and gangsters, who have beaten his best friend to death and in no way cares about political correctness, which is perhaps one of the biggest advantages of the film.
positive;I find the Kirk at the end an untypical monologue for him quite suitable.
positive;That there is a little lack of the bass may be due to the age, but on an adult system it sounds better than some contemporary television series.
positive;Stunts and no cheap CGI effects.
positive;It is surprising that Jodie Foster is not promoted for the film.
negative;Whoever goes into this movie anyway, I can only guess one thing: turn off the brain.
positive;(Let's face it, girls, who didn't melt away at the sight of Jude Law?)
positive;That's his best performance in a long time.
negative;World War.
negative;My girlfriend alone was watching the movie three times.
positive;John Goodman's final fate is personally too close to me, as is the (already shown in the preview) end of Carl Reiser.
positive;To name a few more well-known names, Jeff Fahey and Bruce Willis are also to be mentioned here.
negative;''Unknown Identity'' has unmasked me a little.
negative;Especially when she kills all the residents with her first act of office...because she doesn't know what to do with them...After the time jump, however, the film becomes banal from scene to scene.
positive;But the rest of the cast also does its job more than good.
positive;They present an exciting and fast-paced story with lots of humor and funny situations (keyword: strong communication with his machine helpers).
positive;I really liked the movie.
positive;Wonderful pictures.
negative;From a lot of movies what stole and stuffed together wildly.
negative;It's amazing that nobody rated the movie here yet, although it runs as a blockbuster movie in almost all Cinemaxx cinemas and consorts.
positive;Beautiful teen romance that has a certain sense of reality.
positive;Mills: Awesome!!!
positive;Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece here that portrays the Maya and its culture as a terrifyingly cruel yet advanced people!
positive;Why not directly at Starfleet's outpost, where Spock could already be?
positive;Di Caprio also shows that he is really a very good actor, just like Samuel L. Jackson.
positive;It's a drama like this that contains the most exciting sequence I've ever seen in a movie – when Chris Oâ€TMDonnell enters the hotel room where Pacino is about to shoot himself – that creates a 10-minute psycho thriller from the scene, where you hold your breath.
positive;The end is also successful, although not as surprising as Saw, but the viewer is satisfied with the end.
positive;While some sequences are so absurd that you are already happy to see something so awesome on the screen.
positive;A chamber play which Hitchcok himself would not have been able to make better.
positive;Good movie!
positive;The round is omitted, one of the soldiers celebrates his father's happiness and all are enthusiastic about the movie star in their center.
negative;a suggestive question because - yes, there is!
positive;Finally again a movie about which you can and must think!
positive;Who, just in the second half, can live with telling technical clichés, experiences a great piece of cinema!
negative;Totally exaggerated action without sense and mind, which was cut far too fast and, on top of that, were totally screwed up with far too much wobble camera and any zooms-ins.
positive;the film stimulates to think about its own end- its interpretation of the flood of images.
positive;The cast is top and all actors skilfully deliver.
negative;----------------------------------------------------------------- In â€œThe discharge of the metro Pelham 123â€œ remains everything and everyone among its possibilities.
positive;"A big movie ""excellent"" staged, excellently played (especially of course by Cillian Murphy) and perfectly backed with music."
positive;Also the hardness, as it occurs here, completely surprised me.
positive;so long, choizz
positive;PS: Try not to be stowed while looking at it, as it can really blow your mood away.
positive;You also manage to perfectly combine feelings, action, drama/tragedy in this movie.
positive;I don't lose a word about the content because that's the big surprise.
negative;And that's a bit confusing if the actual yet a movie is that with the sad hero and the unchönen Grundkonstellation tries to transport a positive â€žRaff you onâ€œ feeling.
negative;"Batman Begins and ""The Dark Knight"" tied me up and excited me."
positive;Haunted cool, casual and some cracks on the lips.
negative;The Masons at that time were an honorable secret federation, which consisted of the best masons of the country.
positive;Visually convincing are also the main actors Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac absolutely convincing.
positive;I already thought that the movie would be good (even if I couldn't imagine what should be good in the movie), but that it is so good...
negative;So an application for a beautiful holiday or a great destination really does not give Berlin in Berlin syndrome.
positive;So I just saw the movie with a friend in the SneakPreview and we were very divided.
positive;Since then I've certainly seen more than a dozen times and he still hasn't lost anything of his class.
positive;But that's how it must be in a movie like this.
negative;I just didn't care about him.
negative;"If you just want to watch something harmless, nice and you can tell yourself about the charm of the main characters you get clear with the film â€"" otherwise it is forfeitable, exchangeable mass goods."
negative;The film is meaningless and very predictable.
positive;It is an exciting ridge hike to occupy one of the busiest comedians as one of the most thoughtful commissioners of literary history.
positive;In terms of camera technology, much more was done here than in Adam's case.
positive;Look!
negative;"I would even go so far as to say that here a gigantic potential of ideas and stroy elements was mercilessly placed in the ""sand""."
positive;However, if you look a little deeper into the storyline, the film turns out to be an intelligently knitted story, which has more to offer besides the lukewarm action and medium-excellent acting performances: The whole time the viewer actually thinks that the head of the company is behind everything, has gone mad and so to speak the world domination with the help of a robot army would like to rub itself.
positive;I saw the movie yesterday and found it extremely exciting.
positive;"One can imagine his criticism by the way subjectively Anti-American and Anti-Hollywood, if one likes, however the favorite saying of the Americans is ""God save americana""."
negative;My friend absolutely wanted to look at him and since the criticism was quite positive, I just went with him.
positive;That's how comics make fun.
positive;If you don't take this into account, you will be thrilled by the film and will be pleased to have seen a not typical mafia movie.
positive;Acting performance, breathtaking.
negative;"One cliché after another, one close-up on ""mask"" after another, one predictability after another."
positive;So I watched the movie on DVD last night and I liked it very much.
positive;Then how can a film overroll the whole world and be overshadowed with prizes?
positive;The director of Richard Linklater is strong as always, he shows again how great he is.
positive;Instead, the film presents itself laconically, bizarrely and subtly.
positive;There is not much to say about the plot, our protagonist wants to be the best drummer in the world and comes to our antagonist, the easily sadistic teacher Fletcher.
positive;The story is sophisticated, possibly a tick too unfaithful, nevertheless it makes you think.
positive;The situations and characters are credible but at the same time also harsh and sympathetic.
negative;Too little horror, too much action, too little THE NONNE, too much other monster stuff.
negative;Everything is flattening in front of it and at the end has fallen asleep or as smart as before.
positive;Nevertheless, extreme and merciless.
negative;But who's willing to do this?
positive;He was inspired by the title-giving land of Southern California, which Laura Dern lives in together with her husband.
positive;Of course, it can't be all the way you want it to be, but also with the Lord of the Rings you had to cut it off, for example.
positive;I'm supposed to be.
positive;The best musical I have ever seen!!!
positive;Probably because he picks up similar as eXistenZ, or Bladerunner the always current question about being and appearance / reality and illusion - skillfully combined with a darker ambience and a good portion of action.
positive;This is equally possible from the beginning, so that it remains inconceivable why the two of them can tolerate each other.
negative;In the end, a film that I don't have to watch again, yet offered a entertaining, unfortunately a bit banal, entertainment.
positive;Still, great movie!
positive;ME HAD THEODORE SUPER FALL.
positive;I can't imagine a film only with the little Chaoten (to come in 2014).
positive;"There are the most crazy things and the way some of them are shown and presented is simply great and finds its high point in the technique of masked ¶sewichts â€"" optically, the film is absolutely at the height of time."
positive;In these films ViEl is left out more and filled up with unnecessary action sequences.
positive;These are perhaps the most impressive and best images that this genre has ever seen (historical film/documentation).
positive;There was a barber and his wife, and she was beautiful.
positive;How many good films there are finally, which bore one at the end nevertheless with herkommlich Hollywood-Action ... PS: Moreover, I do not find that every calamity in such end-time films has to be explained.
negative;Who fears himself already before a demon, which acts only invisible or as a shadow.
negative;), everything, from doors to buttons, is recognizable as plastic.
negative;Is the debt collection a revenge campaign?
positive;I pulled the film into the cinema and must say that I am very positively surprised.
negative;Nevertheless, there are 2 points for me to at least reward the effort and the acting performance.
positive;Much too fast comes the ultimate fight.
positive;Very solid entertainment!
positive;Some of the comedies from the eighties and early nineties have remained very good in Remindun and it is good to see them again.
positive;"As in ""The twelve jury of Sydney Lumet, everything here doesn't matter except the plot, the actors and the direction."
negative;Last but not least, something about the buildings or equipment: the equipment is already remarkable, but the food and outfits of most of the characters are too tricky, too ridiculous or too silly to really be able to ride along.
positive;It's a great ensemble.
positive;For me one of the 10 best movies of the past decade!
negative;But it doesn't.
positive;So, in my opinion, the film deserves strong four stars.
negative;What can you do wrong?
negative;There also no Bruce Willis helps with blöden SprÃ1⁄4chen.
negative;Who now thinks that you can laugh at least about any jokes, slapstick or other inlays might be warned.
negative;Conclusion: The low point of a modest series â€ , or: simply overly!
positive;"The Hollywood version of ""Ziemlich beste Freunde"" is not quite as good as the original, but nevertheless worth seeing and this is due to the strong Hillary Swank, which once again shows that it is a really good one."
negative;"""With your glasses everything is fine....., asshole..."" - The predetermined search for your own friend and for the solution of the body around your own film crack turns out in retrospect as a broochy facade, which was only designed to bring still dummy maggots to the obligatory, traditional father's day celebration among the viewer."
positive;But then I found it a little long (that's the negative part) but otherwise a wonderfully crafted film.
positive;That would have been easier to solve.
positive;This could almost be melancholy, would not be the laconic, raven black humor, which had already saved the first part from letting the viewer back completely hopelessly and depressed.
positive;Right!
positive;Absolute top film.
negative;On the one hand an action in April 1961, which deals with the pig bay invasion and the informant search, on the other side Wilson's career, beginning in 1939 with his recruitment for the OSS.
positive;FAZIT: Taxi Driver is an incredibly interesting and priliant film that makes the viewer think extremely well.
positive;I can't judge objectively about this film because it's still the best movie I've ever seen, although I see and recognize its flaws: it's just a bit of horror, a bit of science fiction, a bit of teen film, but none of it's right.Be 'TMs': â€žThe Facultyâ€œ is a filmed teenage fantasy.
positive;I would never have thought it possible for a film to have such an effect on me.
negative;Unfortunately, these scenes are still the best part of the whole movie.
positive;This has also Hollywood recognized and therefore the young crew back again.
positive;Rather, the evocative impression is the result of a not exactly professional, yet extremely effective design and history of creation.
negative;"Yes, well, well, well, well, well, well...as most Emmerich - Machwerke is also this for cinema, not for the domestic TV.Who once saw the air battle under the alien spaceship in ""Independence Day"" at home and tried to chase the point-feeling fruit flies off his TV screen,which came in the cinema still as fighter planes and mini spaceships,know what I mean.The Comutertricks are perfect (how one must honestly admit that one is not killed by Emmerich with them),for example, the actors and roles are flat and nothing telling,whereby crippled by so much American patriotism,that it can become bad even to a Texanic oil baron - even this is a feature of ""Independence Day"" done with it."
positive;you could see behind the scenes how it all goes!
positive;I felt very pleasant the meaningful measure of music.
negative;"""The Hills Have Eyes"" makes it a lot better."
positive;In particular, the film radiates a certain sense of convenience when Trip Grady writes to his book in the morning in the rain, when everyone in his house sleeps drunk.
positive;The final fight between Azog and Thorin is entertaining and dramatic, but at the expense of the war events, to which from this point on no real attention is given anymore, which is why it is difficult to fever with.
positive;MY FRESSE!
negative;so from an oscar premièred film I would actually expect more.
positive;His new work goes hand-crafted and performing a different way: The intensity of the drama is somewhat lower, rather psychologically as well as physically infinitely twilight with a winding riggan.
negative;But filmic style and elegance of a police story in the 60s to good music have already better mastered the Beastie Boys in their video sabotage.
negative;When the parents die, you're an orphan.
positive;The fields are ordered, the house repaired, TIMOTHY is from the tribe of Munsi, very erotic for GRACE.
negative;Everything seems somehow put on and no longer as thirsty and credible as in the first part of the film.
negative;As not to be expected, I did not play the video games to AssassinÂ ́s Creed before.
negative;No more and no less.
negative;But when he approaches, against the evil [spoiler][/spoiler] Bob Marleys of this world, no eye remains dry and the blood flows!
positive;Honesty and openness are the guiding principles of their music.
positive;Speaker of Michael Caine: JÃ1⁄4rgen Thormann), one should realize that the film is not only about cooking.
positive;Forget about the biggest part of the garbage movies.
positive;"Conclusion: Eiskalter exciting thriller with a super leading actor â€"" surely the most exciting phone call in film history!"
negative;A factory hall in Berlin can be everywhere.
positive;A schÃ1⁄4ler can't handle it and it comes to disaster.
positive;For me, the movie is the best part of the show.
positive;It's just a brilliant movie.
positive;The dinosaurs are still misrepresented according to the latest scientific findings, but this is a reminder of the old films.
negative;I expected a lot, because theoretically one could make a very funny film out of it.
negative;Nevertheless, the rest of the bad ones remain: bored actors, much too voyeuristic squatters, logic holes, a lame end and a partly inconsequential camera guidance.
positive;I think that might seem a bit perplexing to smaller children.
positive;To provide this collective with a voice was an ingenious idea, the Borg Queen has succeeded in its effect unspeakably.
negative;It is neither explained how the hero managed to revive the certainly extremely chaotic first time, nor how he succeeded the next three years.
negative;Conclusion: exchangeable characters, no new story, little action, everything has been there before.
negative;It reminded me of Kafka's process.
positive;George would probably not have had a better material for his last appearance than this drama about the complexity of life in dictatorships, about adaptation and quiet resistance.
positive;The film is a real pleasure, both aesthetically and in terms of content.
negative;Atomic Blonde by David Leitch didn't beat me off the stool like that.
positive;However, this is not only due to the tempo that this film offers here and to the coolness that is generated by the whole songs, but also to the rugged characters and the famous cast.
positive;:)
positive;But the film also has other strengths: Raymond's relationship with his daughter is great and the flair and look of England in the 50s and 60s give the film its unique look and recognition value.
negative;"However, the nomination for the golden raspberry in the category ""bad script"" is completely justified."
positive;Look!
positive;'Brothers' is beyond the great acting performances and the great script out a movie that has the power to move something in people.
negative;Not even why he chose her as his victim.
positive;Everything is also always only a matter of opinion.
positive;So far he is the best of the series but I'm already looking forward to the 4th.
positive;atmospheric, exciting and streamlined, but just a trick.
negative;There's just no emotional access to the relationship between them.
negative;Theo ́s ex-wife is also in the car.
negative;"I personally store the digital copies of the films in a folder called ""Spiritless tides"", whereby I understand recurring conditions, where you better not find yourself in an airplane at the wheel."
negative;Super is for me personally but something else.
positive;He solves him over everything and gives him a suit with which he learns to fly.
negative;If you get caught, you don't get beaten up in the basement.
negative;"- On this ship, of a few hundred absolutely equally-looking ships, was the central control of the droids, which can fight down on the planet!Well, has he decided the battle smoothly in his own way and that is quite possible!That's what I call ""The Power Is With You"" - or, for example, the fantasylessness of a scriptwriter, who has in fact already become overwhelmed by his own secretion?In addition, a terribly uncharismatic Darth mouth (which, quite unlike his name,is over almost the entire film), does not even get a fifth of fear in front of him, whether his ridiculous horns and his violently trimmed face on the nose of anakin and Obi Wan in the last part.To the best of all, Lucas increases again in the following two parts, until the enormous duel between anakin and Obi Wan in the last part, the first episode almost forgets."
negative;We have here a family that has been destroyed and torn apart by suicide, now you see the suffering and misery that the bereaved ones experience and experience and zap a little through the everyday worries and problems of those.
positive;Overall, however, the film was very entertaining.
positive;this movie could personally pick me up in any case.
positive;What can you say about that?
negative;On a romantic evening they meet the shady Russian Dima (Stellan Skarsgärd).
positive;Not only one of the best love comedies there is, but also one of the best movies there is.
positive;At least that's the way it is with me.
positive;"I recommend watching the old movie ""Blade Runner"", then the movie gives the right kick :D"
positive;The dialogues were sharp and funny to shoot!
positive;Never before have I laughed so often and heartily in a movie, I forgive absolute top note !
positive;Evaluating Looper is not an easy matter.
positive;"I would rather place him under the category ""adults who want to be young again"" as already ""Susi and Strolch""."
negative;Even as Lothar is depicted, I am strongly reminded of Aragorn.
positive;However, McDonagh misses so much cinematic self-understanding and automatism that one rubs one's eyes in the end product and asks, how a dermaÃ1⁄4nzen, horny mix could emerge from it.
negative;What remains is a not even pernicious action film.
positive;Grounds: Despite the perfect staging as usual from the first part, there are some small logic leaks.
negative;Unfortunately, no comparison to the strong and innovative Viktoria from 2015.
negative;After Eagle Eye started with one of the most interesting and promising trailers of the last months and film starts rated him with solid 7 points, one could be curious.
positive;The movie is just awesome.
positive;Is nature so strange to us?
positive;Hard war movie by director Antoine Fuqua.
positive;He surpasses himself with each of his roles and manages to pull the sympathies on his side each time.
positive;The action is hard (80s) as it must be!
positive;Dr Sean Maguire helps him to make the best of the situation.
positive;It offers great effects, a lot of feeling and a wonderful sound.
negative;The soldiers, the victims of the war, unfortunately had too little profile to feel with them.
positive;He just puts 4 adults in an apartment and then gives another reason to argue.
positive;So I found that the film actually hit the point.
positive;Only the pure fall as a lay actress at some provincial theater seems as a cause somewhat thirsty.
positive;Not the best action movie but again something very handsome!
positive;At the end, the tension builds up again correctly, but suffers a bit from the somewhat too long end.
positive;"The input results of a ""Dark Knight"" or ""Inception"" want to make you believe that the numbers of ""Source Code"" make you doubt."
negative;I've known the show for many years and I've always watched it enthusiastically, but the movie is not at Simpson's level.
positive;"The logo of ""12 Monkeys"" is also very intelligent."
negative;The story actually seemed very funny and interesting, but somehow I missed the laughs in the movie.
positive;Absolutely great cinema, this new film by Woody Allen - and then this outstanding Cate Blanchett!
positive;Super story, top acting performance, wonderful music AND: an amazing ending!
positive;The Bösewicht is in my opinion rather shallow in return to others like Goldfinger or Scaramanga!
negative;Even people who want Bond movies, probably nothing can do with it.
positive;There is no theory of evolution, only a list of creatures that Chuck Norris allows to live.
negative;The film pulls itself, is predictable and not even funny.
negative;With HP it was absolutely justified and necessary.
positive;As a conversational sacrifice the audience comes individually to the turn.
positive;If you are in a bad mood or aggressive, you can skip your bad mood and just skip everything in this dance.
negative;no idea why the movie has such good reviews!
positive;That's what a pirate movie should look like.
negative;I would have wanted a better mix.
positive;At the first show you are lured (at least so it was with me, I did not know the book before) first to a wrong leader, in order then to be surprised in a grandiose turn (I personally consider it to be the best, if not even to THE best turn at all in a film).
positive;"Sometimes a film works alone because it presents the viewer with an extremely sympathetic and lovable main character, which the viewer can then observe for a while â€"" this is also such a film."
negative;The chance to give the electronic music world through a realistic and supported by authentic moods, has so unfortunately been given away.
positive;What can you say about this movie?!
positive;For this the scene Spoiler is: with the grandpa, who can be killed all the more stronger and knows how to shock.
positive;"There are stories that are far less ""fantasy""-heavy to bring out the trend concept again."
negative;This ensures some laughs and is not quite unimportant for the story.
positive;Only lack for me personally were however the 3D effects, which were very exhausting to look at.
negative;The evil Germans who kill in war.
negative;But naturally as always taste thing...
positive;For movies like Gravity the cinema was invented - and the 3D technique!
positive;he wants to do more and more and then it becomes too much.I think everything fits and star wars is really cool!!!
positive;Why is Albert Brooks so unknown?
positive;The director succeeds in bringing a film to an end (to the beginning) in an unprecedented way.
negative;Titanic is the only movie I know that has managed to combine a good romance and a decent action cracker in a movie.
positive;On the way forward, this review includes many spoilers, so if possible only read after the movie!
negative;Too bad, had expected much more due to the trailer.
positive;especially tom cruise, which I never gave much credit to until then, made me clear why he belonged without question to the very large ones in hollywood.
positive;George Clooney just did a perfect job.
positive;This doesn't do much at the beginning, but the fear in the film is constantly rising up the deeper the students enter the forest and he more they recognize their location â€ , and yes, I have to admit it, in the last 5 minutes I had real, total fear in the cinema.
positive;Many copies of it simply no one manages to reach this row, which simply captivates by its humor, its great action, the brutality and the search for the extranatural.
positive;no mainstream, but I can only recommend the movie.
positive;[spoiler][/spoiler]is a very[spoiler][/spoiler]
positive;The use of Simon Pegg as a sidekick is often an end in itself and the steady comedy number of him is sometimes overstated, the villain is an interesting PErson in pale representation and many places repeat themselves by the principle ... nevertheless, in the end you leave the cinema in a good mood and after an exciting film.
positive;Of course only 3 million people saw this film, knew enough themselves who didn't go to the cinema why the film was already on TV on 6 December.
positive;No words.
positive;Adapted to the time of that time, ahead of its time and even today still contemporary.
positive;A really memorable person who doesn't fit into the threesome Alex, Piet and Tom is Piet's neighbor, whose character remains very pale and from which you don't get smart.
positive;"And that this car was armored and was not a 0815 car and therefore did not carry ""no scratches"", was certainly also clear!!!"
positive;Young German moves from Saudi Arabia to a suburb of Berlin and meets friendship, love and life there.
positive;an important reason for the success of the film is the supporting role.
positive;The dance presentation with a gun at the checkpoint, where Jonathan performs his service, is a gaudy gimmick to the soldier's everyday life, which is described with distressing boredom, senseful and senseless employment, demise and also violent stress with form completion.
positive;Of course there is a healthy attitude and above all understanding for such kind of art and that seems to be what some people lack.
positive;The film is perfectly insinated and lets the viewer look into a darker, morbid future, which is terrifyingly very credible.
positive;Part of shooting another big last Rocky.
positive;It's been a long time since you heard something from Mr. Becker.
positive;"However, I'm also a big fan of the crazy counter-design: of movies like Manchester by the sea, in which apparently so little happens, where the acting performance doesn't want to shock you from the first minute on (which one actually would like to experience in a drama), where the camera drives and dialogues seem not to be ""valuable""."
negative;More like boring Arthouse movie.
negative;Sorry, but how can you make such an unspeakably heartless and bad thing out of such a great template that only the name has in common with the template???
positive;This is not a typical 0815 slug, but rather a film that you have to feel or which comes authentically rueberkommen.
positive;One of the best movies in 2008!
positive;The Nice Guys is probably a prime example of how important well-written and interesting characters are for a movie, because I would have been able to watch the duo (or maybe even trio) for hours, just driving through Los Angeles and chatting.
negative;What a really bad Marvel might have been, is again nothing more than a children's film for shallow creatures.
negative;The film delivers impressive effects but the serious sad plot borders on melancholy that culminates in Tom Cruise sitting in a garden for minutes lost in thoughts and staring ahead.
positive;Why is the separated foot not shown?,...?).
negative;How is it ensured that the group not only makes a decision in itself, but also a reasonable decision?
positive;Conclusion: Respect for the script.
positive;A movie without heroes, without villains and without hope.
positive;However, this did not prevent him from making an outstanding film.
negative;"But there is a star and has the most spectacular appearance: ""American Pie"" Star Shannon Elisabeth takes a bath in the film, and she doesn't suspect that the water in the tub is actually the melted snowman - but he soon becomes ""hard"" and copies it to death in a macabre form (even in the credits follows the question ""Where was the carrot in the bath scene?"")."
positive;Of course, the gags are not deep-rooted, but the word joke, the situation comedy and the brilliant actors (especially the 4 main actors Ben Stiller, Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) make the film a gagfire without landing below the belt line.
negative;This movie is more like an action comedy.
positive;I watched the movie today and must say that I was extremely positively surprised.
negative;* Oh and Yoda return as astral projection.
negative;Without Will Smith he would certainly have become a flop.
positive;The soundtrack to this film is also highly recommended.
negative;"with a movie like ""donnie darko"" you get at least to grÃ1⁄4bel, but that's just bad!"
negative;Rarely has a movie given me as little attention or tied me up as this one.
negative;Secondly, there are far too many technical and physical details, which are partly not made sufficiently understandable to the spectator not trained as a quantum physicist.
positive;The action and the effects make the film a blockbuster that you should have seen in the cinema.
positive;When you get involved in it, you get quite beautiful in the grumbling.
positive;and Gwyneth Paltrow as his assistant in the film.
negative;When THOMAS SEYR was in love with ALINE, it was interesting again, but the love story was a bit boring here, almost as boring as in the movie â€žBefore Sunsetâ€œ.
negative;However, the film fails completely when it comes to dealing with these problems.
negative;The Magnificent Seven on Crack.
positive;And my special respect for W. G. Ochsenknecht.
positive;Because Scott Cooper manages to captivate the viewer until the last minute, without him being able to say for sure how the movie will end.
positive;is the first and also the best part of the Saw series!!!
negative;"After the interesting start around the catastrophe of the Space Shuttle, a pure ""hysterical mother cares about missing child"" develops themed sheets in which any logic is left outside."
positive;Michael Douglas as Gorden Geko is so gorgeous that it gives you a pleasure.
positive;And then this line-up: Karin Dor is great, Michel Piccoli and Philippe Noiret make the best of their fine parts and Claude Jade runs up the stairs with her film father (Frederick Stafford remains very boring as AndrÃ© Devereaux, unfortunately, too) and breaks down after looking at the window, that I also believed today that Michel Subor was the man on the roof of the car.
positive;"Who liked ""The Last Samurai"", ""The Eternal Gardener"" or ""Syrania"", will be more than enthusiastic about ""Blood Diamond""!"
positive;Otherwise, it's all done.
positive;THE world's end!
positive;â€œGrand Budapest Hotelâ€œ is not, apart from its obvious memory, a piece of the trial of complicated depression, because it does not look away.
positive;In this movie he plays out his influential enemies with spirit and fist.
positive;9.5 points
negative;For me, this movie was rather a cover-up.
negative;IN THE EAST WHEN IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
positive;Very nice movie with a very good, but I've never seen him so old, Brad Pitt.
positive;"So it should be and that shows and the movie ""Letters to Juliet"" In Verona, the Via Cappello 23, lovers' couples stand in front of the balcony of the ""Casa de Giulietta"", in front of which the in love Romeo is said to have waited for his Juliet."
negative;That's more than I expected.
negative;The action scenes are also cut so quickly that much of the opulently programmed and fascinatingly implemented battle scenes simply perish.
positive;Clear recommendation.
negative;Otherwise just save the money for a better movie!!
positive;Whether Michael Madsen , David Carradine , Lucy Liu , Sonny Chiba , Daryl Hannah = all top!
negative;After that, he flattens more and more.
positive;Anyone who has hoped for brisk action with the name Kathryn Bigelow is wrong here, who knows how to protect such titles on a gold mine.
positive;The film is one of the best animated films I've ever seen.
negative;I did not feel tension or interest at any time.
positive;[...]â€žThe Greyâ€œ creates a similar close-knit atmosphere, like Ridley Scott's Ur-â€€žAlienâ€œ, John McTiernan's â€žPredatorâ€œ or, from the snowâ€TMs setting, even a little bit more lying down, Carpenters â€žThe Thingâ€œ.
positive;I've been a fan of him since Disturbia!
positive;I have even made the impression that he has deliberately taken this film away from favorable mainstream production methods to be able to represent exactly the realistic, darker-dirty atmospheres addressed by Björn Becher uncompromisingly in which there are only chess pieces but no real heroes, but only those which are exposed in the media.
negative;My money would have been better off.
positive;At this point I would have wanted a little more.
negative;That's where the variation stops.
positive;10/10
positive;"The insidious violence in ""The Color Purple"" is more brutal, since more realistic."
positive;Many were also bored, disappointed, found the film too long, could not understand the love story, could not discover any chemistry between the two main actors etc.
positive;This time, when I'm evaluating, I fluctuate between 7 and 8.
positive;However, the ever-present presence which one wakes up daily with the other can not end well... ....or perhaps nevertheless?
positive;"Everything else would already be a cover-up, because then we would have ""only"" a sci-fi thriller that is unusual in many ways, visually resonating at the highest level, but which leaves a whole bunch of questions & frowns back."
negative;So Stallone might have been unmasked as a great hypocrite and the motivation of the demonstration of violence in JOHN RAMBO bursts into a different light!!!
positive;1.
negative;For example, Cesar is looking for information about L.E.
positive;You just have to have seen it because of the realistic fight scenes that are actually made without ropes, little protection and safe without PC as already mentioned.
positive;Diego is so uhhhhh hot and so nice!
negative;Ultimately, as already described in the title, it is absolute trash.
positive;And they are not exaggerated, as some here describe trivializing.
negative;It lacks the charm of the X-Mens.
positive;The serial killer Stuntman Mike is aiming for handsome girls on the wide, lonely streets of Texas.
negative;Russel and Jackson are used to charismatic, goggins commute between convincing and overacting.
negative;Well, I saw the movie today, and he didn't exactly pull me off the stool.
negative;Look at the trailer twice and you've seen more entertainment than in the actual movie.
positive;In â€žUp in the Airâ€œ a man is on the way over the clouds, who has created an invulnerable refuge and with himself and the belief that he does not have to leave it and for no one ever to leave it, is pure, although his task is to get several people out of their refuges every day.
positive;And that's in 4 categories (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay).
positive;The timings become bigger and take place less frequently, the plot centered on Jake Gyllenhaal as Graysmith.
negative;Here I say this again more precisely: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-82BYQCJGdY
positive;I think a lot of things have been done right here.
negative;Accusing the inhumanity of conquest, the enslavement of entire people?
positive;After possible starting difficulties, to which also the increasing cocaine addiction of his brother counts, Yuri is finally there alone, however, can hold foot in the weapons business.
positive;To the Schaupsielern: The actors in Warrior are from my point of view perfectly selected and distaste nobody does me even slightly.
positive;Packing.
positive;Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows once again an excellent performance and encapsulates the actually simply knitted figure with so much humor and yet sensitivity that he thus becomes a secret star.
negative;The only thing interesting about the film is the landscape.
positive;Of course, one is first skeptical, against what is presented to one by a weaving of film and live tapes.
positive;Like so many others, I also believe that this is the best part of the series and that it is absolutely worthy of the end.
positive;It's useless, but it's funny.
positive;While the third part was still very well entertained because of the great duo Jones/Carrey, one can almost speak of a funeral of the famous comic hero with regard to part 4.
negative;There was little to complain about handcrafting, only at the content it had at times considerably.
negative;To make it short, I don't catch this movie.
positive;It becomes brutal, colorful and stylish, so much is already clear.
positive;"^^ (By the way, it's on YooTube to watch the ""12 jurors""!"
positive;"Anyone who knows the Batman comics and grew up with it (especially the Silver Age-A""ra from the 70s) will agree with me: This is the best Batman movie ever."
positive;It is clear that he is hypocritical in a very oppressive way for understanding how to regard one of the drivers as a man despite everything, since he fights with himself and his actions also repents, but the teacher does not face himself in the film, but commits suicide.
positive;But the whole comes in the form of an exciting and action-bearing story, which also masterfully stages the personal drama of those affected.
negative;Not because the film is different from all the mainstream war movie classics we know, no, I think it's made absolutely bad by hand.
positive;I find this movie hammer horny I've already seen it 20 times and can see it again and again
positive;As he himself admitted in an interview, he never looked so ugly, and indeed so ugly that he looked good again.
positive;Again and again the film surprises one with creative ideas and scenarios.
positive;You never really know which side he really is on.
positive;5.
positive;But as harmless as the film may start, it continues to go on and on.
negative;Just this constant change stops me up or therefore I can hardly acknowledge with the film.
positive;So.......have seen the movie for the first time tonight...and he's already my favorite movie...probably because the main person reminds me a little bit of me...and I think it's so much...to the movie: The nicest movie I've ever seen.
positive;The roles of the film are superbly cast, especially the three young protagonists convince by authenticity, honesty and spontaneity.
positive;I haven't seen such a self-ironic and funny movie in a long time!
positive;Image and music are also part of the successful overall image of Arrival.
positive;Why is everything repeated?
positive;With the exception of tiny little things, the film corresponds to the book and is even better than Mockingjay 2
positive;"Already such talk as, ""Cigarette?"
positive;): 7/10 Final result: 9,333 Unfortunately there are only 9/10 points but it would have been quite easy to become 10/10, maybe even more.
positive;Much darker than aliens, for example.
positive;I saw the movie yesterday and I was thrilled!
negative;Especially since one, as already mentioned by filmstarts, is not affected at all by whether or not she dies now.
negative;You mean that would be a devastating criticism?
positive;Exterminated.
positive;brilliant film and now because of the logic we start with the first film some say why the pirate in the first part screams obwol he is dead that lies on it because man pain net5t only checks she plays herself in the head as well as man stops bleeding remembers it but doesn't hurt it mekt man it no because since the head plays with he says there's nothing so you don't notice but the pirate sees it and his brain what goes normal it hurts without doing it 2 film like jann it's the babossar lives you left him behind in the cursed treasure and you took care of it when you first see that you're cursed that your organs are missing from the brain so jack shot him when he was still cursed after a few minutes so you didn't hit the heart and you've left him in the cursed treasure
positive;2.
positive;Top!
positive;I found it great: the memory from the point of view of the boys, the cautious touch on the family of the girls, the small common adventures, the tender Mief of the (not only American) suburbs, all presented harmoniously and not overdrawn.
positive;This is a film of its collected emotions just kicking the viewer out of his socks.
positive;Everyone is enthusiastic about it. It is only done what is fun, with no consequences whatsoever, if there is anything to come.
negative;Director's great.
positive;Conclusion: Snow White and the Huntsman is a bit to treat like 300 or Van Helsing: he does not offer a story that completely knocks around, but the pictures and the presentation have it in themselves.
positive;I only looked at JCVD because I wanted to see van damme play.
positive;Great work from the entire team.
positive;Johnny Depp as the only useful man in a village, which is terrorized by an alleged headless spirit - sounds at first quite inappropriate.
positive;The 15 minutes on the Empire State Building you can get around pretty well.
positive;All fear was ultimately in vain, because the makers, who are also almost all involved in the series, which is obviously good for the film, have succeeded in making a funny movie that even small defamations do not matter.
positive;But all the others are fantastically occupied and play great!
positive;Barfly convinced me and also entertained me well.
positive;"I had watched this movie last week in the cinema and when I think about it, I am immediately ""exhausted""."
positive;Never seen, but I still know that I was real to and fro.
positive;Just as she saved her life and never gave up really convinced me and I also found really great.
negative;Through long journeys you get an impression of the vastness of the country.
negative;So the film is about how all the films from this circle actually start...two brothers...the one tells the other a sentence,which then runs through the whole film and dies then naturally...but so something of very predictable,but naja...after that comes the other brother, deeply hit naturally in a new city...nothing does he feel like..what changes in this film of 5 minutes...from one day to another both uniconnections want him, he even gets almost directly the girlfriend of the square deer, who is at the same time daughter of the unichairman...well, the rest can then be thought on...he makes the one dance troupe better...blablabla,then he flies because of his punishment,because of his flame that bends again...he is at the end of the hero!
positive;Even for people who are not the great fans of animation strips this film is recommended.
positive;Just great.
negative;Even though his truly large masterpieces, such as the cleverly designed thriller drama 'Memento' (2000) and 'Prestige' (2006), a nested mystery thriller, have been back for a while, he created with the 'The Dark Knight' trilogy a truly new flamed Batman cult, with the middle part in particular, at the same time the name giver of the cinematic trio, being considered an outstanding representative.
positive;I am 15 years and actually out of the old for such movies!
positive;Grandiose action cinema... very dramatic and massively staged and even if something gets too short of tension and even if a little character drawing is attached (which, of course, is heavy in view of the length of the substance), a very captivating film.
positive;Cool Gkvyrolxbmv Hbvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
negative;The only positive thing you have to take advantage of the film is the evening-Ländic atmosphere that it radiates.
positive;With The Ice Queen Disney returns to the old strength.
positive;The rare ones are brought to the cinema by such horny cop thrillers.
negative;And the real Holmes wouldn't be jealous of a wife of Watson (that's part of the stories in Mary Morstan's example), especially since Watson is also a married woman who participates in adventures.
positive;What Peter Jackson conjures up here for pictures on the canvas.
positive;The highlights of the film are certainly the psychedelic images and dream sequences and therefore the film is worth seeing.
positive;Quite clearly one of the best films of the MCU and clearly better than last â€žAge of Ultronâ€ when dealing with its bursting surroundings from all sides.
negative;It is quite difficult to survive the first (but very long-breathed) hour.
positive;When the mutants can be seen for the first time in the direct totale, a part of it disappears, because one can imagine it much more animally, but is made up for by the representation.
positive;9.5 out of 10 points!
positive;The 2009 box office hit.
positive;Respect and hat off before this moving movie DEN they must have seen.
positive;She seemed bored, but then she really got started.
positive;Simply artificial and successful.
negative;But he gets 2 stars because he is very good for craftsmanship.
positive;I saw the movie for the third time today...I wanted to see how he seemed to me this time....was a couple of years ago.... I have to say, even though the love story between Rose and Jack may still be so cheesy, I liked it.
positive;"un-end-lich end-geile comic filming (the feuilliton prefers to call it ""adaption of a graphic novel"", haha)."
positive;All in all, the film Disturbia is a worthwhile movie to watch and deserves a high rating on my part.
positive;ID4 belongs with my absolute favorite movies.
positive;It also acts in part in terms of the technological possibilities frighteningly real.
negative;I think I can agree to that if I say: I'm just as stupid as the mean American.
positive;Oscar Isaac in the role of genius Nathan, but this surpasses it all again.
positive;"The ""Western drama"" offers a successful change to the everyday Hollywood cinema and looks despite the 160min not long breathing."
negative;In the film he still says that he has gone through all calculations three times and that everything is correct.
positive;So I can't make people understand the criticism.
positive;Overall seen a neat blockbuster for a popcorn evening.
positive;It transports the mood great, so you can get into it extremely well.
positive;Because in winter it is bitterly cold and supermarkets there are also not exactly at every corner.
positive;So I learned some more good advice about current ArtCore, e.g.
positive;I grew up with the old part 1 2 3, so episode 4 5 6, so to speak, then the episode 1 2 3 enjoyed time in my teen years and was unheard of by the episodes 7 and 8, as well as Rouge One derbe.
positive;Actors fit, good special effects, great action and stuff.
positive;After a short introduction it's round on the canvas.
positive;"I also like ""Archie and Harry"" with the cuddly Hollywood Titanic team Burt Lancaster/Kirk Douglas."
positive;But above all, this love must also be implemented mentally, which the mother of Max unfortunately does not succeed.
positive;What fascinates me, however, is the moral aspect of the film.
positive;I can only recommend anyone who wants to see large cinemas to lead this movie to pleasure.
negative;"But in large parts the ""story"" drags itself through endless scenes that have no real connection and do not advance the action."
negative;"The cast, the production team as well as the categorical classification into the category ""ComÃ¶die"" actually let us guess a funny movie - that is ""Adventureland"" but at no time."
positive;When he meets his son for the first time after 11 years he shows him the cold shoulder, but in Max he quickly sees himself again.
negative;It all starts perfectly well.
negative;"The only film that, despite its small weaknesses and lengths, became a cult film and the hype around Tarantino is justified and remains ""Pulp Fiction"", of which quality he is unfortunately miles away despite any ""that-is-but-so-wanted"" argumentation."
positive;In doing so, he defies every obstacle and proves what he will later describe as his personal talent.
positive;Since I personally like boxing movies very much, I also watched this movie and noticed that he has the best, yes you can say, boxing scenes in the movie that you have ever seen.
positive;This was done without the use of 3D, because 3D would have been only stellend to the style and the camera guidance of the film.
positive;Everything next to Ian Fleming's figure of Mr.
negative;In addition, it would cost a lot of work to design a jungle instead of a desert.
negative;The story is so predictable that despite some laughs mainly boredom prevails.
negative;"In the original Lina really wants to go away - she is already at the station counter and wants to buy a ticket from her last money ""to Italy""."
positive;I watched the movie yesterday in the cinema and must say WOW!!!
positive;"Jared explains and explains and then comes the sentence ""here comes Margot Robbie in the bubble bath with the explanation""."
positive;The two children also play a very impressive role.
positive;What should not be missing: Janus Dissing Rathke as the leading actor is fantastic.
negative;They can still roar like lions, climb like monkeys, are strong like bears and bite like bald head's hard-dressed pit bull.
positive;Not for people who are waiting for a lot of action or excessive brutal scenes.
positive;Sometimes extremely hard and so simply not to expect with Chackie, it represents a completely different aspect in the portfolio.
positive;"Finally, you have an incredible number of people and ages in your mind, which is good - because the film is not without morality; it rather tries to convey several messages to us."
positive;For example, I don't find the bush in the moment when it looked helpless in the classroom.
negative;Commented, I find more than questionable.)
positive;So, it remains undeniable: in terms of fine humour, no one does anything to the British.Conclusion: Original story full of funny dialogues and funny ideas â€ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
positive;And, well, androids are always a little weird.
positive;Class, on the other hand, are the references to The Lord of the Rings.
negative;1.
negative;"I've seen the most different fantasy movies, but ""Hook"" somehow couldn't convince me."
positive;But that doesn't change anything about the fact that it's one of the best movies for a very long time.
negative;"At least we can now sleep ale calmer ;-)"
positive;In addition to this social-critical component, Timberlake and actress Amanda Seyfried reclaim all sympathy on their side and review the impulse to overturn an out-of-control system.
positive;"We'll see if his plan goes up...And I think that the sentence from Thanos to Thor ""You're supposed to aim at the head!"""
positive;As Q in the gallery says to Bond - the old schlachschiff ... - only that it was not scrapped but made mobile again.
positive;The beginning and general of the whole film reminds very strongly of the episode IV, which I personally already liked with Jurassic World very much.
positive;Thanks Sly for this great Rocky Saga.
positive;actually I don't like movies where kitsch or everyday are in the foreground and have even looked at it because I reese witherspoon likes but naja so you can see.mark and reese play very convincingly, and even after 4,5 or 65 times you will not get bored because you are somehow constantly being banished by the story and the acting performance.
positive;Of course, I also understand all Illuminati readers who went home completely disappointed after the visit of the film.
positive;"Only the VHS editions are completely uncut, the UNCUT version was also released on the PayTV â€"" station premiere earlier."
positive;"For example, there would be: -the colleague of the cocaine snuffs and goes to work in ""high"" condition."
negative;"The whole film is a compilation of the wonderful and fantastic documentary ""Planet Earth"" which consists of several DVD`s."
negative;I've lost my finger.
positive;Well, then we come to the actual review : Episode III This movie once again had this great feeling of the first time.
positive;So much for the content, too much should not be betrayed here due to the tension.
negative;Actor: the Hilary Swank in the leading role seems misoccupied is also due to the completely inappropriate dubbing voice, which seems from film beginning to end only staerend.
positive;A unique film, but many people think the film is a bad smack of Matrix, I see it completely differently.
positive;Project XÂ2 and I'm part of it!
positive;I also found Gregory particularly charming.
positive;"Conclusion: Outstanding Bond actor and a very exciting film as the beginning of a new Bond-Ã""ra."
positive;So I really don't think he's bad!
positive;This effect is most likely caused by the high frame rate of 48 frames per second, which Peter Jackson was the first to use in this series.
positive;Normally, I am rather contemplative with exuberant praise.
positive;Also the degree of hardness is right at the right place and you notice that you do not sit in a soft-split PG13 Mainstreamteeniactioner and that is also good!
positive;The camera teams insist on the protagonists, all want to participate in the reasons that open up there, everyone wants to be right with his guess - they are all voyeurists, as well as the audience in front of the screen, which awaits the very big bang.
negative;The evolution of man, which in the end he carries on with technical means, with the striving for his own destruction, symbolized by a black block as initiation and HAL as the end.
positive;As brilliant as the resolution of the film is, it is at least as banal and the actually important questions are not answered, only the obvious ones.
negative;"However, I would have preferred a sing-free version ;)"
negative;Write your own review (at least 50 letters)The trailer for this movie looked not bad, and the last movie by D.J.
positive;"""Michael Clayton"" is not just Clooney, Wilkinson and Swinton."
negative;It's a pity, unfortunately, that the stars of the film, the retro charm and the scenes reminiscent of Indiana Jones, get into the background.
positive;A huge Moloch who tries to tell a godlike person how and where people have to live and act in him.
positive;It happened at the time, when two outlaw brothers fell into the hands of justice.
positive;The sequel is now much faster.
negative;The name is a cognomen, a nickname that is attached to the two previous names.
positive;With DVD and Beamer at home, you don't feel like it.
positive;"Bryan Cranston doesn't play the Heisenberg here, but the loyal friend of the ""Driver"", played by Ryan Gosling, who delivers a phenomenal acting performance here."
negative;Marvel has so with his bosses.
positive;It is enough to publish completely two, three trailers, but not in this edition.
positive;Only today, just two hours ago, I saw and perceived this film for the first time.
negative;At the end of the movie, you're going to be a couple.
positive;At the beginning is briefly shown how Max was captured and then you can already see Furiosa as she leaves the citadel.
positive;Everyone hates child abuse, everyone believes children, but what happens if it doesn't tell the truth?
positive;The crowning conclusion of the line!
positive;The film is simply boring away from the dialogues.
positive;"Especially the role of Pierre's was played wonderfully, as well as the roles of the ""subsidiary"" ^^' And what I particularly liked was the end, because the list of ""Cast""'s was interrupted again and again by movie clips, one is practically forced to watch the film until the end."
positive;I had the pleasure of watching the film in French cinema in OV.
positive;Without, however, achieving the dynamics.
negative;The background story, which is explained at the end, should not hit anyone from the stool.
positive;The conclusion is unfortunately shown far too quickly.
positive;Both are incomparably large and make the film more than worth seeing.
positive;A through and through great Feel Good Movie.
negative;Sometimes I had the feeling that they have no idea of horses and this adventure is just in the first place.
positive;The director's instructions, which they have of themselves, implement them exactly as they would not have been able to make it better.
positive;This is in some places very silly and also often so special that you already have to be a real fanboy to capture everything, but especially if you can that is worth the movie again so properly.
positive;But these are generated less by loud sound effects than by good camera settings.
negative;One reason for this is that, mainly the minor characters (so all except Tris and Four) remain extremely pale, you don't get backstory from the closest friends, you don't get backstory from the enemies, or anything else.
positive;Everything points to a rebirth of themselves - up to the Buddha on the Chinese/or Japanese?
positive;He got no directing Oscar for Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Casino etc., although they would all have been earned.
positive;so so confident of the plate that it is a true joy.
negative;Director, camera, editing and acting are at a high level.
negative;Downstairs someone has written, the first sex scene of the two is so super great because sexual tension flows!
positive;Bravo.
positive;Easily digestible food but for that really extremely funny and very entertaining!
positive;Scorsese films have always been visually impressive.
positive;All in all a good, worth seeing movie, which unfortunately can not connect to the preceded parts.
positive;But also Rachel Weisz, who stands above all in the indie and arthouse range always for qualitatively very good films makes her thing super.
positive;There are two main things to say about Kung Fu Panda: 1.
positive;"I find that this film shows exactly what the Americans don't like: the truth of what these ""super soldiers"" do with a people who had to suffer from Saddam anyway, of course, there are passages that remind Rambo, but the Americans don't even rarely do which or?Let's come to this great government, which banned the film: instead of always crawling into the USA in the most esteemed doing something for Germany!!!"
positive;Tommy Lee Jones is also used to being good.
positive;It's an incredibly great movie!
positive;In doing so, Ofelia help the various mythical creatures from their dreams to process the reality.
negative;Since Aliceâ€TMs last visit many years have gone into the country and most residents are either dead or still hoping longing for the return of the small, tea-drinking englander.
positive;The title alludes to the ignorance and innocence that goes with childhood and ends with it.
positive;Nevertheless, I would have liked, it would not have given him, if he drives the crash of youthful now still forward.
negative;Mankos: - Action instead of action - Character Kylo is choleric, unsovereign, chaotic and has nothing on the pan.
negative;So I didn't even watch round two in the cinema, although the trailer certainly looked good and looked very good with the prominent faces acuh â€ , but it was a pretty turner then that the movie was held back for 7 months again so that it can be converted into 3D.
positive;"In ""Crazy Heart"" Bad Blake does not speak very happy about his music and his performances."
positive;Stimulates to think and is also recommended for those who like to do this :).. Top
positive;A top actor and a top cast for our dear Batsi.
negative;Why does Luke want to kill Kylo first, where he only feels the evil?
negative;I (including war, duels and a severed Darth mouth) was released from 6 years of age.
negative;"And with the idiot bonus that you can grant him, you can ""deadbeat"" the 86 minutes of some time."
positive;(the secret star is attached to the septopus)
negative;"""It just happens."""
positive;The role is promptly cast with the eccentric actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), but this becomes a problem case rather than a source of hope.
negative;All shock scenes are predictable, even the entire story is deleterious and transparent, especially if you have seen one of the numerous predecessors.
positive;Some scenes even bring salmonflash guarantee.
positive;10 out of 10 points
positive;The movie was just totally over-excited and funny.
positive;It is also not difficult from the beginning to immerse yourself in the cult world and sink into it for just under three hours.
negative;The Oberschurcke is not even worthy of speech here.
negative;This film is soo boring that I seriously thought about doing the same thing to the other twenty moviegoers and leaving the cinema prematurely.
negative;Too bad you could really make something out of it but I had thought several times if I was doing the movie to the end.
positive;The film shows very nice that the souls of murdered people cannot come to rest and learn how to make themselves felt even without having a body.
negative;I'd like it to go up to 50:50.
positive;I liked that.
positive;While other directors shoot one film after another without the audience wanting to see the films, Gibson makes one thing right, films that remain in discussion.
negative;Although the last Bond films were already a kind of permanent advertising show, but at least entertaining.
negative;The story is not dolle and the implementation is just as acceptable.
positive;I don't think I've given any movie here yet five stars, now I'm doing it.
negative;Terrible!
positive;Thank you Tim Burton for this masterpiece!
negative;Conclusion: I would say who has seen part 1,2,3 will be disappointed by this.
positive;And what might bother some, an end, that all explained the movie then also not.
negative;Except for a few exceptions, the film was boring!
positive;Why, but at Payne, it's always like he's reaching me full.
negative;Maybe to borrow on Halloween, but that's all
negative;"control as the good ami, ""kaos"" as the boss russia, the one who has the atombomen."
positive;Why FILMSTARTS here only 4.5 stars I don't understand.
negative;In addition, the whore Steve (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a serving woman (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) form a humanly warm counterworld.
positive;Lundgren as a demon-jäger?
positive;In her mother's role she feels overwhelmed, where also her behavioral son contributes a large part.
negative;In the film it is about stopping the release of a virus that a lunatic has developed to kill the half of humanity.
positive;To combine Christmas magic, Halloween horror and already at the time of the creation of the film as an outdated doll trick to a musical will hardly succeed anyone again as well as in this masterpiece.
positive;get GOAL on dvd and form your own judgment and go to the cinema in GOAL2 LIVING THE DREAM in MAI!
positive;He drinks his tea in all peace of mind, but rather looks with concern to his future.
positive;I have now seen the movie 3 times and every time, I don't know why exactly, comes a smile over face in the final euqnz, and one feels as if one would fold a beautiful book.
positive;A very beautiful fantasy fairytale.
negative;Somehow there's no mood in this movie.
positive;You have the feeling at the beginning, the movie rumbles you through a ghost train.
positive;He actually has everything that a really romantic movie needs: a cute lead actor *snacks* and a cute lead actress who fits very well together!, the boss stepmother, a bit of action, the funny friend of the cute lead actress (he was really distasteful ^^) and a good charm!
negative;Important topic, unfortunately a timeless topic, sometimes more up-to-date than ever, the sadder that it was implemented so superficially.
positive;The experienced cinematographer (Giora Bejach) delivers an imaginative and versatile work, which would awaken the interest of every cinematographer.
positive;Enjoy him - and pronto!
positive;I never really liked the old film and the show.
positive;First, a very fast entry into the darker atmosphere of the film follows.
positive;I love him
negative;can not be without spacesuit in space.. To name just one.. minimally realistic then it should be.. No, part 2 I will not look at..
positive;For me very clearly 10/10, because it is the most beautiful, moving and mute movie I've seen for a long time.
positive;Apart from that, it is more than unfair to judge a foreign actor after sifting the German synchronized version.
positive;"In my opinion, the movie is just as good (or even better for Avenger's fans) as its predecessor ""The return of the First Avenger""."
positive;However, these do not only express their joy to finally be able to watch a football game in the stadium (in the case of games by men's teams, women are forbidden to enter!
positive;Due to the wrong guides of the first part of the film you are standing there so unscathed that this fireworks of tragedy catches you completely.
positive;Not to process the terrible trauma, but to hunt the psychopathic killer on his own.
negative;That would be the right explanation for me.
positive;Slowly but surely film starts are joking.
positive;Almost all Oscar movies seen (American Sniper & Selma missing) and this one was the best so far.
positive;In any case, the film is one of the impressions of the fullest real films of our time.
positive;The last novel Mockingjay is already being filmed (divided into 2 films), and the entire crew will be involved.
negative;The film begins in a London orphanage during the wartime.
positive;Even if the hard reality is cruel and irreplaceable, he can still find a sense.
positive;Super final sprint of the magic series Harry Potter.
positive;You should have seen him, however, in order to be able to decide that.
positive;First of all a reference to my person, I am not employed as an obliged person (replacement service) directly in the rescue service, come and become in the form of internships and sanitary services but again and again with it in consultation.
positive;I have to criticise the beginning of the film, which is really far too kitschy and which is a bit too ridiculous, after all, of a very serious story.
positive;You should look at it.
negative;"- - - - - - - the ""adel on the bike"" might like the film."
positive;from 6 years on you can show this film to anyone who likes good music and a nice story.
negative;In my opinion this movie clearly came to early!
positive;When the Dementors came, ... .
negative;That's the question I took from the movie.
negative;That's not similar!
positive;Even if the production in one or two places leaves the path of the right documentary and perhaps becomes too intrusively sentimental or dramatic - the work shoots out for a short time beyond its goal (besage sequences are about the demise of two members of the choir).
negative;Anyway, I'm still looking forward to the 7th (but I'll also read the book).
positive;David Frost and Richard Nixon, played by Michael Sheen and Frank Langella (oscarreif!
positive;You can look more often.
positive;many things are different, but by no means bad.
positive;This may work very well with the anyway as the thirsty and differentiated Batman.
positive;It's a really weird movie.
positive;It's a trip to Wonderland when choosing the right pill.
positive;This time, really top locations were chosen.
positive;We men are primitive, it's true.
negative;Of course it is nice when a 4.
negative;Very funny, that ́s it then but already - M`Barek fans will be good.
negative;And given the threat, it looks more like Walker is just looking at his own career, which is quickly recognized by Hunt.
positive;At first you don't understand at all what is happening and even later not everything will be solved with wide but in the end the movie still has almost everything that makes up an entertaining movie !
negative;But the movie is still interesting.
positive;"""Man Of Steel"" competition"
positive;At last someone talks about what many people think!
positive;But this doesn't bother me any further, but also stimulates a little the imagination.
positive;The pictures of the icy heights look great and here it is finally worth watching a movie in 3D again.
positive;On the roads of his wife he goes with her and her children to his home community, a mountain village in Tyrol, where they participate in the funeral.
positive;Consequences of this destruction of the basic trust of children to their main reference person are sometimes severe traumatizations of the children as their mothers.
negative;Not really.
positive;All top: The actors and their abilities, the plot, the action...
positive;exciting thriller, with strong actors above all Jodie Foster, who plays her role very credible.
positive;When I saw him, I didn't think at first that he would put me under the spell, but he did, and that was terrifyingly fast.
positive;Stanley Kubrick does it, alone by letting the camera drive around one hall corner after the other, to give the viewer an incredibly murky feeling.
positive;And that is, to say the least, a revelation.
positive;In Road to Perdition there are several such sequences.
negative;I couldn't really feel in one of the characters and didn't get really warm for the whole movie.
negative;Find the movie pretty overrated here.
positive;Completely without Music Score, the film still manages to build up a tension that is almost impossible.
positive;The rest of the cast is fitting and very good.
positive;When he is released as Superman, he also implements this very well.
positive;I forgive 5 points, it would be a Hollywood movie with brand crew pay 4.5 points.
negative;In addition, the not all too good reviews got within my joy circle, perhaps also this inclusion.
negative;The mafia stereotypes have been fulfilled.
positive;I liked the best Scipio (Rollo Weeks) and the little Babarossa is really sweet!
positive;"Everywhere in ""tinker tailor ..."" it flusters and crunches."
positive;This is also good, because this series has dominated the horror genre for far too long.
negative;There's no use in all the high jubilee.
positive;But also the action of the US-Militär which ultimately led to the killing of Osama Bin Laden is shown very detailed.
negative;But I can't even share all the praises for the movie.
positive;Rob Zombie gives the whole thing his own style.
negative;But as a Godzilla fan you prefer to stay away from this strip.
positive;In addition, it is for me the best love film ever made.
positive;Perhaps rather tomorrow is a beautiful film about losses, self-recognition and new friendships.
negative;I'm sure there are big actors.
negative;I then also nodded and woke up at the end of the film, where I only noticed the American flag.
positive;"Tim Burton simply has it to make such wonderful, extraordinary films that do not correspond to the ""mainstream porridge""."
negative;The only plus point of the complete film are the beautiful landscape photos, which can really convince.
positive;Anyone who has kept an unimpressed view of glamour and glamour, stars and asterisks for the canvas scene can not be impressed by mass-effective marketing tricks and distracting maneuvers.
positive;The film brings everything with it without the film being overpowered.
positive;Children are happy. Highly recommended.Something for the whole family.
positive;Helicopter lights, soldiers, firefights and raids present the cityscape.
positive;Look!
positive;The dialogues and the story are just great!
positive;For fans in any case ok.
negative;Despite an incredibly beautiful and atmospheric backdrop, the film hasn't caught us in a single moment.
positive;This film had to end like this, I think, at every other end I would have come out of the cinema with an untapped feeling.
positive;At first I could not start much with the character V, he was even unfriendly to me and also the fact that his face remains hidden throughout white for the time being to unmask.
negative;Also this verbidnung of optics and content is relatively banal.
positive;The three main actors harmonize well with each other, especially Ron and Hermine.
positive;"Gillis affectionately calls them ""wax figures."""
positive;The songs of My Little Pony: The film are unforgettable pieces of musical pleasure from equestrian (and non-equestrian) throats, performed in a quality that lets them stand on the same level as the best songs from Disney's musical repertoire.
positive;I can't understand how people can only do something like that.
positive;Among them is the interpretation as media criticism and cynical deconstruction of marriage.
negative;or the detailed infatuation on the street collinsport.
negative;It's not a bad movie.
positive;This was for me the only weakness of the movie.
positive;I just liked this likeable way with a lot of vaguem (but that's just nice!)
negative;Introduce tomorrow into history.
positive;The viewer forgets to ask the how or why and can accept and enjoy the film as it is.
negative;Since one has a mercilessly simple concept - and fails in the last instance so much, that one simply cannot believe it.
positive;And this is exactly what distinguishes the film in my opinion: The very flat and stereotypical personifications of good and evil at the beginning, become more profound and plastic in the course of the action.
negative;Well, and that's how the circumstances make me a banal again â€¢ one such is one when you shred a Woody Allen movie?
positive;Morgan Freeman plays just as well.
positive;If that doesn't scare off, he's got a lot to laugh about!
positive;An incredibly good movie that you never notice its length of 2:50 hours.
negative;Reference: if you found the trailer funny to the film and can laugh at curse of the caribbean over the monkeys, then you should watch the film.
positive;"Joel and Ethan Coen play with ""Burn after Reading"" with the consumer cinema visitor: the music is used inappropriately, as a genre a comedy is given (many think of Adam Sandler etc. - but also grotesque and skurilles applies comedy), the end is simply satisfying (which I personally found very good... any typical Hollywood movie would have explained the scenery more satisfactory), and thus attracts money from the pockets of viewers who probably never looked at the film without the large advertising machine, because the material is actually presented for a program cinema."
positive;However, anyone who gets involved will experience an unforgettable film experience.
positive;It is important that such works are made and that discussions are triggered, or at least some thoughts are spilled...
positive;"The superheroes, who jump 10m far, run faster like cars, jump on driving trains without bruises, put 10 feet in the face without movement and then only ""properly"" grow still over themselves I was more tired, if they are also beautiful to look at."
positive;also the other roles are perfectly set.
positive;The film is based on the model of the same name, which is again based on true events.
positive;"Again a beautiful example for the fact that the British cinema has preserved its very own charm and identity - quite in contrast to the German film culture ;)."
negative;I had high expectations for this movie!
positive;There were only three little things that have bothered me a bit.
negative;One should have extended the scene either far and so Atlantis could really be allowed to grow or the scenes should be painted.
positive;And again one takes a lot of time to explain the figures, to give them a backround and slowly to push the captivating tension forward.
positive;Simply awesome!!!
positive;He is not embarrassed as the liking Jurnalist writes.
positive;See for sure!
positive;visual and funny film seen.
negative;It was hard to get behind the jumps.
positive;I mean the first one was already cool, but the second one is just better because there is more happening and it's also more about love and so en beware!!!!!!!!!
negative;If there was anything remarkable about the film at all, it was superimposed by the oh so great effects and pathic inlays.
positive;Both films stand in principle for themselves alone and so one should also look at them.
positive;Who does not know the first should not do it and enjoy the second in full affections !
positive;He deserves the 5 stars and I'm looking forward to the second part.
positive;The score has also become good.
positive;But make it better for now!!!
positive;In JB Tarantino shows himself from his not so violent side.
positive;This is also due to the fact that not only the drama aspect (with good actors, partly improvised dialogues as well as the visibly dense hand camera, which just fits here) is beautifully elaborated, but the science fiction part really has its place as well.
negative;The second aid of the film is in 3D animation, from then on Paul Tibbitt tries to copy ''The SchlÃ1⁄4mpfe-Filme'' in the boldest way, all jokes are lost and together the story are lost, only the effects/animation are to be praised.
positive;That's how it is with good movies.
positive;There was just a lot of joke in it and it wasn't too flat.
positive;But because of the many pluses, this becomes a little bit of a...
positive;Genial masks, equally ingenious and matching actors and great effects.
negative;Only the action scenes pop very well and make fun.
negative;If it is true that Christopher Nolan had the idea for this film already at the age of 16, he would have been better advised to have his puberty imagination buried in his school booklet or at least to tell it to an adult audience demandingly.
positive;I have caught myself waiting for certain key moments, which are emotional and take with me, just as it is done in classical dramas with the typical rules of a build-up of tension and sudden feel good or feel bad moments and then a happy ending etc...I don't want to talk bad about this convention, I also love such movies/dramas.
positive;This also starts the dilemma because everyone is already pre-polized in the milieu in which he is just good.
negative;Know one, know all.
positive;And here's the point why I still find the film great: Basically all the motives of Capote are already laid out in the film, but they fall victim to something of the overshooted archetypal style and the Hollywood kitsch.
positive;As far as history is concerned, you quickly notice some plotholes.
positive;The film, with 83 minutes for today's relations, is quite short and has the courage to finish the story without a bigger tamtam and has something like that, which is rarely the case in the current film landscape: A perfect end.
positive;Billy Bob Thornton believes in the impossible and makes it possible.
positive;Criticism is not tolerated, in case of emergency one denies with known sentence blocks.
positive;(Had I not expected) Andrew Garfield plays his role completely, shows in his quiet moments all can be and presents himself really fantastic.
positive;Good or evil?.
positive;In any case, absolute cult film and should not be forgotten and necessarily seen.
positive;";-)"
positive;"""My mother was so white that in the puff of Santa Fee they only called her the ghost. """
positive;Nevertheless hat off, just for this surprising writer of the script!
positive;"In the end, I actually waited for it to say: ""After a true event"" - because that would have been quite possible!"
positive;He plays them very well!!!!
positive;She was a good partner for the rather robust DJ (ok, I admit, he was mossy).
negative;It is shot only on innocents by the bosses of militärs.
negative;Sir Ian MacKellen obviously has fun at his role and provided for some laughs.
positive;So yesterday it was time to see one of those Disney classics again.
positive;Since I saw the first two nights in the museum, I knew I had to watch the 3 film and I can say I didn't regret it.
positive;He calls home from a telephone booth, also allows his buddy a few words â€ , and suddenly disappeared.
negative;I would recommend to first look at its current account balance, if you want to afford a ticket for it.
positive;Ultimately, however, it is above all one thing that we haven't seen for a long time: a large Spielberg film on the big screen.
positive;Conclusion: A slightly different football movie full of heart, joy and the serious view of a peaceful situation!
positive;"Compare with ""Sixth Sense"" or similar."
positive;All in all: Cool!
negative;And... honestly, has anyone seen a pack of bad animated computer kits in the last few years?
positive;The production, camera and sound are typical of Nolan at the top level.
positive;Okay.
positive;"The story, which is told here, is so rousing, so heartbreaking, so refreshing and joyful that it almost robs you of the frame; one is constantly chased through the highs and lows of the characters, feels and always desires, so that they can see themselves, help themselves, get their problems under control, etc. Adam Elliot draws wonderful pictures, which let the viewer immerse themselves in a lovingly designed world, which in this way could not be admired for a long time."
negative;"), that I don't understand the boy's disappearance at the end of the movie (both children fall down the escalator in the dark, but why does he appear in the next scene in a seemingly completely different subway terminal; surely he thought:'uih is the dark... I'm going to run from the only two people I know and I'm worried about and watch what awaits me...'?!)...."
negative;Been expecting more through the hype.
negative;The acting performances are weak.
positive;It's just a pity that next to me there's so much talker again.
positive;Well, I'm going to look back at home.
positive;Hey, Marlon!
positive;according to my opinion, the film has succeeded well.
positive;There are hearty moments, but none of them make you laugh.
positive;Incredibly atmospherically told with targeted, sparingly used shock moments, grandiose actors and a multi-layered story.
positive;But is that enough for five stars?
positive;It's worth it!
positive;"Although now sounds quite complicated and confused, who has seen the movie will hopefully know.... SPOILER END Another reason why I now get my first criticism is that I saw ""The Illusionist"" last week and unfortunately have to say that Prestige is pulling the sharper in comparison."
positive;Besides, it doesn't seem like Pierrot and Majid's son, who are talking on the school stairs at the end, are strangers.
positive;It's crawling, it's scraping, it's buzzing...
positive;Fantastic!
positive;Quite clearly, Spider-Man 3 is the pre-existing peak point and almost the best movie of the series.
negative;There's very little coming over.
positive;The characters were all very well thought out.
positive;was looking at the kini last night.
positive;I (18) just watched this movie.
negative;Hobbit 3 is guaranteed to top it because there will be a war as expected.
positive;will surely buy me the cd a movie that everyone must have at home
negative;Each of the characters got a small backstory, which was not exactly in front of creativeness, for this movie however was also completely sufficient.
positive;Death is life.
positive;You can only recommend it.
positive;Conclusion: For me not the most powerful and pompous, but certainly the NETEST fantasy film!
positive;That the professor dies was quite sad and the gene then dies at the end.
negative;"In the end you have something the ""like nice"" feeling."
positive;When I saw the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War at the time, I was incredibly excited about his solo film, because I really liked it there.
positive;But precisely because of these socio-critical moments, he is, in my view, even a deut better than Inglorous Basterds.
positive;Akin doesn't make this mistake, and that's one of the big strengths of this movie.
positive;Maybe that's why I feel the movie much better than described here.
positive;The music is always used appropriately and fortunately does not even try to explore the spectacle (the Avengers theme is simply fantastic).
positive;"The one large dwells in many small stories, which take some dramatic turns, such as the shooting Ivesâ€"", the claustrophobia of Danny's most zealous tunnel founder, or the blinding of Colin, a document flaw."
positive;This film is a work of art in itself anyway.
negative;The dialogues, on the other hand, were weak, the story was totally drawn by the hair and reminded of Kabel1 horror films.
positive;Who cares a little for astrophysics and co.
positive;I find it particularly great to see how simple such a fraud was at that time possible...you just have to think about it!
negative;And why is never an alien on the idea with all the great superweapons that only they can use themselves to come up with the idea of an armed insurrection?
positive;That convinced me.
positive;What I also feel good about is that some questions that appear in the movie just won't be answered.
positive;His profession is to dismiss persons everywhere in the country.
positive;So he was in the video store and I had to have at least looked at him once.
positive;"The bar shooting from ""Inglorious Basterds"" was often hailed as the best shootout in cinema history."
positive;Fundamentally, â€žBabelâ€œ is a monumental, politically explosive film, which shows great abilities in every scene and thus moves quite in the Olympus of contemporary film art works.
positive;Prometheus can connect in its very strong first half to the previous alien parts.
negative;It is not so that there are no funny romantic teenie movies, but She ́s the one has the entertainingness of a nutella bread!
positive;"Either one likes the absurdity of situations, the bizarre characters, the twisted dialogues â€"" or not."
positive;Bad actors?
negative;The motivation of the psychopath should be revealed by some short flashbacks, however, this is simply too clichéd selected.
positive;Since the stories are all entangled with each other, the film still gives the perfect touch.
positive;This film and its open and compelling representation of >Theo< is a very good film.
positive;Saw the movie yesterday in a sneak and has to admit that the feelings went up and down.
negative;Not always, but there are so many scenes that don't fit.
negative;"the film is overvalued and statements like intelligent to the film, fade away me.I think the idea with the quilts is not bad.But time and again are ridden on this fallen duselei number after motto "" ok you can call me a slut, but I am not:"" the over the whole film. it is at all no tension built up."
negative;But you can also leave this and simply keep the archetype for set up and pseudo-deep-minded.
negative;He who emboldens, the overall impression is lost.
negative;Supposedly, the film is based on a true event, but what is written on it cannot be recognized and also eludes my knowledge.
positive;Where I was in the cinema everyone was quiet and concentrated
positive;An absolutely worth seeing film that must be seen in the best resolution!!
negative;Like a Kreutzworträtsel An altogether conventional film biography of the English mathematician Alan Turing, who cracked the code of ENIGMA in the 40s and thus contributed to the victory of the Allies.
positive;They're squeaking something not objectively.
positive;And the evil end is awesome.
positive;The plane misses its destination, but all the occupants of the UNITED AIRLINE plane died in the crash.
positive;Angel Heart convinces me after each sighting on new and offers best entertainment.
positive;"It brings this sentence ""violence creates counter-violence"" very much to the fore."
negative;Therefore also the not exactly small lengths arise.
negative;Also in a comedy I would like to identify with the characters, I would like to feel with the protagonist and see what the figure on the screen experiences.
positive;"All in all, ""The Salton Sea"" has become an all-round successful thriller drama that can convince and please with a great story, imaginative twists and an excellent lead actor."
positive;The party nights are just funny and quirky, however, illuminate the characters aml from another side.
positive;Of course, it is a cruel story, but also one that has to be told in this form.
positive;your Rene
positive;Even if social criticism does not achieve a really special purpose, the psychological component nevertheless knows how to understand.
negative;Just like my previous speaker, I'm also a huge fan of MAX-Punisher comics and was unheard of by the film.The original story is different the darker and dirty look is not present instead of the movie plays in sunny Florida and Tom Jane does not remind in any way of the unscrewed Punisher, the criminal even before running camera torches alive to send a message to her colleagues.He makes jokes with his neighbor flirts or bathes in slbstmits.Also the rest of the cast is colourless and except the fight scene against the Russians there is not even proper action,hopefully the new version will be better Ray Stevenson fits visually better.
positive;I'm still thinking if I'm not going to the movies a second time.
negative;BUT the end of the film has drawn for me personally so much by the hair, as that it leads the whole film ad absurdum.
positive;I looked at film original in English.
negative;Tom Hiddleston is allowed to play the most interesting character with the opaque Loki.
positive;"You can't say, ""Hey, it's just a movie."""
negative;That's all there is.
negative;The film implies that every mother can forget her life as soon as she has children.
negative;We were all right in the end...
positive;The director demands of course full concentration and that over 3 hours!
positive;It offers the viewer everything that such a movie must have: great action scenes, great chases, funny talk, a sophisticated plot and well-laid actors.
positive;It is merciless to be confronted with it!
positive;The action scenes are good but nothing special especially since also the spells seem very stubborn.
positive;Such stories to tell, so irreplaceably painful and partly reusable that can only be cinema.
negative;The spectator almost waits until another herd of wild Germans occurs behind the corner and is promptly sifted through by the American supersoldier.
positive;Sorry, but that one just didn't understand the movie and the subject.
negative;Atmosphericly made great, but otherwise more a medium-sized animation film.
positive;That was my first reaction when I read a short description of the film.
positive;At Sunshine, the above mentioned is the biggest, but not the only logic hole, but the film was rated very well.
positive;Adrien Brody with the role of his life!
positive;But this is rather a strength than that it would represent a weakness.
positive;There's no such thing here.
negative;Much also looks too similar and too dark.
positive;As with other Spencer movies, a simple story is available.
positive;Especially the biting humor !!!
positive;So I found the acting performance of especially Franka Potente (of course also of all others) impressive.
positive;The animals and their animation were very lifelike and even tiny details, such as the gentle ear-laying of Shir Khan's teeth were taken into consideration.
positive;In a critique he was described as British!
positive;Welcome to the John Cusack Show: Cusack plays the leading role (there is no scene without him!
positive;Even without a dark-haired BOND!
negative;Overall, the film trembled for two hours, I searched for an arc of tension in vain.
positive;Carole Lombard - in her last role - is also convincing.
negative;Spoiler: The most terrible is the end, so ridiculous that they don't come up, more than a smile that there are which don't speak a bit German?
negative;In addition to this impersuousness, I was also destroyed by the exclusive use of stereotypes: the poor thing from the trailer village, the lonely bitter cynical old man, the greasy manager, the stupid embarrassing idiot and not least the evil German boxer.
positive;What a cute movie.
positive;"When we saw the film for the first time, we immediately noticed charlie ""Pete""...and we immediately became obese..he has the certain something that many people do not have, this smile enchants a completely.....we have watched the film now for sure already 10 times and 1 times in German.....in English he is much better!"
positive;The atmosphere is like the score again well succeeded and can keep up with the first part.
positive;He just comes way too suddenly and in the middle of it.
positive;Even if other lords should be of different opinion: this is for the writer THE ulitimative mixture of Pulpstory and Superheldencomic.
positive;"All other roles are also great, just like Emma Stone who plays the ""Femme Fatale"" nuances!"
positive;Conclusion: German classic and satire on the greasy press
positive;"An impressive film about the development of activity (earlier work) and our ""life""!"
positive;Free of kitsch or over-increase.
positive;I'm just saying midichloreans.
negative;Although 'Hereditary' is in fact atmospheric and atmospherically filmed, the story and the dramaturgy do not accomplish what the hardly explainably good reviews promise.
positive;Respect for the producer.
positive;"I can't confirm cinematic sounds described here in the review; I don't have a second of the film as being too long.The strange case of the benjamin button is a masterpiece that one should definitely look at when one is ready to deal with the life (especially fate)."
positive;It is also interesting how some vampire myths are linked together.
negative;Like most other football fans, I was looking forward to the documentary by Wortmann.
negative;Where is the impenetrable action that captivates the viewer?
negative;Dante!
negative;Hmmâ€¦ Technology meets Vikings.
negative;Otherwise such a shock: incredible story, a (large) band of cliché actors and a catastrophic Joaquin Phoenix ... Actors' studio mimics of the starter course, irreplaceable.
positive;Strangely, I just thought that the movie mediated the whole thing as if drugs were good?
positive;Black Swan – what is real, what Fiktion Tchaikovsky Ballet from the point of view of a perfectionist prima ballerina The highly acclaimed master director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) wants to break open the rigid forms of classical ballet through the re-enactment of Tchaikovsky's ballet â€žSchwanenseeâ€œ and demands a lot from his ensemble, the New York Ballet Company.
positive;An excellent film - well done!
negative;"The dialogues could at best be called ""the future"" from the actor's performance, however, seem rather horny and anything but fluffy or even plausible."
negative;And how do they bring the story forward?
negative;3 out of 10 points.
positive;The cast is well chosen.
positive;The acting feats with a Jack Nicholson, which probably gives one of the best performances of his career, are equally impressive.
positive;And that has so many reasons that it will be hard to get to the point.
positive;In addition to the booming â€œSlasher filmâ€œ in the 80s and the flooding through favorable sequences to â€œNightmareâ€œ, â€œFriday the 13thâ€œ or â€œHalloweenâ€œ, many of the original horror films saw the light of day.
negative;the one in a throbbing leading actress at some point went to me a little keks after all.
positive;"I also find spoilers: the ability of the ""right"" bosses something too much of the good, especially towards the end."
positive;Absolutely brilliant!
positive;And in the audience there are mostly people with at least the age of today's Alois fog, banished from the atmosphere and wide awake to the last minute of this more than impressive film.
positive;http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/119024.html 4 The film is a small masterpiece with a great Michael Caine.
negative;Also the confusion of the victims of the relationship was simply super iced.
positive;In short...whom Haunting Party liked, this war/drama/adventure should definitely look at.
positive;The heroine convinces however unfortunately not on whole length.
positive;Everything fits here, the movement, the music and above all the light.
negative;Build your own shit!
positive;So all we had was the DVD and I have to say, within a week I saw this movie three times.
positive;But the T-800 is not to kill Sarah Conor this time, but to protect her son John.
positive;But it doesn't quite get to the first part.Rejoice in the third.
positive;He'll be desperate, but he won't give up hope.
positive;Surprisingly well succeeded here is the combination of macabre humor and the horror itself.
positive;The movie is awesome!
negative;In particular, it should be pointed out the film music, which really absolutely fitting and brilliantly emphasizes Electro and otherwise shines.
negative;What Verhoeven does, however, have to deal with is the actual topic.
positive;Gänsehautfeeling guaranteed, fanatsisch implemented and filmed... more such films please
positive;More (detail & character development) one would probably only be able to get out as a multi-part production and so one has a well-made political thriller, which depends on the facts, clichéd German bashing (Somewhere we as Germans are still in many places after 60 years still somehow Nazis) avoids, just like pseudopatriotic hurricane cry (actually a Hollywood film in which no star banner is produced :) ).
positive;The director also wrote the script.
positive;And what kind!
positive;I liked it super, and a certain similarity to the renter is quite recognisable, but it is by no means a plagiarism!
positive;Ultra cool action, ingenious effects and an incredibly disturbing vision make the movie a must!
negative;How often does she suffer and cry and scream desperately about the dwindling welfare of men in her life?
positive;"I, too, can join the positive reviews of ""Nebraska""."
negative;It just stays on the track and the best scenes the dear, good trailer has unfortunately already betrayed us.
positive;"""Science-Action"" probably fits best as a label and who likes me thriller with futuristic ambience a la ""Total Recall"", ""Minority Report"", ""Matrix"", ""Blade Runner"" etc. will enjoy ""The Island"".Somehow the story reminds me of ""THX 1138"" with the difference that Bay continues where Lucas' classic ends."
positive;The protagonists are too sympathetic.
positive;The Krabbelkäfer are also beautiful creepy.
positive;Also in the cinema was real Star Wars flair.
negative;- - - - - - - - - - had stress and relax?
positive;In every scene, De Niro and Pacino unleash all of their abilities, which in the cafÃ© scene sets the climate for acting.
positive;The action is gei, the bow is also there, and Sly Stallone turns out to be a physical miracle... as he trained his body at 60 years old again, is simply crazy... if you think about it more closely, you come to the conclusion that without drugs it can probably not have gone by itself and probably does not just extend his life expectancy.
negative;The film is interesting, but despite good spooky performance at some point from the middle boring and fitting to the title strange.
negative;The characters lack the depth, the story of the trick, the jokes of subtle touch - the whole film is more like a slapstick comedy.
negative;BUT the end is so bad, incredible!
negative;Too bad!
negative;"Should you have rejected a visit due to the already described ""Let it go"" trauma; don't worry."
positive;Despite a small budget, Matrix became one of the best movies ever made and I'm sure the sci-fi genre won't see such a good movie for a long time.
positive;...Paul Dano and Daniel Day Lewis absolutely sensational - with a masterpiece of image and sound.
positive;The story is very simple, but the implementation is just perfect.
positive;A love story to life.
negative;Beeping beam and naked grip are mentioned, but are obviously not in fashion.
positive;I've had fun with all the characters.
positive;If you just want to give yourself to a movie, you have landed in this movie, a hit.
negative;The reason for this situation are zombie-like vampires who fall over people at night.
positive;The credits almost invited again to Flennen.
positive;I have just seen this blockbuster - and it is absolutely one - on TV and must absolutely get rid of my 10!
positive;Simply awesome, a masterpiece!
positive;So, the right movie, if you want to have a challenging conversation.
positive;Of course it is a matter of taste, but I would recommend the film at any time.
negative;The question arises, why the screenwriters of this galaxy have not tended to accept themselves from topics.
negative;The cuts are too fast and hectic, the Bond girls don't stand out and the action scenes don't offer innovative innovations.
positive;It was just overacting.
negative;Is Clint Eastwood coming next time?
positive;Since I'd seen the movie before I left the book, I know how to feel who you dip unprepared into this nerve game.
positive;The actors are excellently cast up to the smallest supporting role and act like that.
positive;The movie was really not bad, but something bothers me.
positive;If this movie doesn't go to heart, it doesn't have one.
positive;Alone, that it almost does not make any sense at all, but simply always raises more questions than to be answered is also something special again.
negative;Disney destroys the Star Wars universe!
negative;so in my opinion this film is overrated.
positive;the camera guide is super the actors too (goodman plays with only because he knows wan!!!)
positive;the book was one of the best thrillers I've ever read and the topic around opus dei, the church and its cover-ups naturally also appeals to me as a critic of the Catholic church.
positive;In the end, many question marks remain.
negative;The CGI was pretty good, especially in the finale and the optical design elements were also very pleasing to me, as they radiated creativeness (different from the story).
positive;Note: 1- Actor: A word for the: outstanding.
positive;the end is surprising and untypical, but refined enough not to exclude a continuation.
positive;The fact is the film is harmonious and entertaining.
negative;If you like masked Meuchelmörder, you can go in, if you love good horror shockers, you should look at something else.
positive;All in all no to a masterpiece it is not enough but overall a legendary film
negative;Saga, after just 20 minutes of playing time, I became aware of why the fans are so worried.
positive;What distinguishes him, however, are the consistently brilliant actors and the very densely staged atmosphere in their play between potential frustration due to April's failed theater premiere, the subsequent emerging hope by the idea of an emigration to Europe and the ultimate despair as all dreams break apart because of a renewed pregnancy and Frank's growing doubts.
positive;And even more: he expands the whole scene enormously and yet credible.
negative;"Every now and then also the appearances of the ""bÃ¶sen Puppetmaster"" are set quite well in scene, but this is just not enough for a successful horror film."
positive;A daring undertaking, especially with regard to the possible play results, with lower quality of the film would have been an indispensable financing disaster, would be, because Hazanavicius' film is this year not to be beat with regard to his fellow favorites, albeit unpredictable and hardly to be grasped by me.
positive;But still good.
negative;Hope they cook the soup again after the old family recipe in the next Bond movie.
positive;Especially Doc (Kevin Spacey) is a really scary boss, of whom you just have respect as a spectator.
positive;That's a great movie I probably didn't watch for the last time.
positive;"But don't worry, the film is from a guÃ ́s: the story (yes, in spite of all Klamauk there is one) holds one up to the really surprising pointe who is behind the mask in mood, the gags are indeed in some cases real Gaga (highlight of the stupidity: the race with a stairlift) but all in all the film brings more and above all better absurdities on the row than about the last ""Scary Movie"" stripes and then he scores still by countless really funny guest appearances of German celebrities, which I will not anticipate here naturally."
positive;I just don't understand this kind of criticism.
positive;Although I also liked the older films very much, I had the appearance that Batman Begins comes over something to ERNST.
positive;With sympathetic characters, an optimistic story and quiet, beautiful staging as well as poignant, sunny moments, the film is completely life-affirming and conveys a good feeling of life This may not be the most original, but also something of which you can never really have enough.
positive;That's great.
positive;One of the best movies of the year.
positive;So... me and my daughter had a good time.
positive;The dialogues certainly did not take place in this way, but it is not unrealistic at all.
negative;"A paedophile couple is associated with the Germans (""I have seen the evil"") and the Russians are all criminals anyway."
positive;Gyllenhaal also convinces in his role of investigating detective.
negative;The movie already has some very nice scenes... I would probably find it quite passable if I didn't play the games.
positive;A Batman film that is not suitable for children, however, by the darker athmospheric!
positive;Spoiler: The fight Batman against Superman is, by the way, just the preliminaries to the really big showdown
positive;From young, stuttering hoovers to gay and strong hoovers.
negative;The story itself is quickly told: a boy observes a suicide of a mafia lawyer, who has betrayed him before his death the place of a corpse, and since then is in danger of life.
positive;This is the thought-of-person available Steve Jobs is little...... :-)
negative;Not only that the cameraman probably didn't know what he was doing, but also the cutter, which one really urgently should forbid to cut films again.
positive;In my opinion, the topic Ã–l and the related American interests in the Middle East are presented in an interesting way and are also shown on which paths and by what means these interests are enforced.
negative;In the end one is glad that one has finally survived it, if one has not left the cinema hall in advance.
negative;We've had it all.
positive;All this creates a quite unique atmosphere.
positive;In times of many action-packed 90-minute movies sometimes something different and therefore despite few Schwächen 9/10 points.
positive;It's amazing that John Boorman created this movie back in 1980.
positive;This impression is supported by the hectic, partly wild camera guidance.
positive;A fascinating film!
positive;A real summer movie, full of joie de vivre and fun and good mood, all covered with fast-paced Abba songs - a movie for summer evenings to just feel good.
positive;strong performance of both actors, good script, and a very convincing Ryan Gosling of which I personally would not have expected it.
positive;By the way, I only know the original English version, but I am sure that the German Syncro will not get to the original - DANG!
negative;In the middle part, I wondered if the scriptwriters or the director or I were on drugs.
positive;And Ennis finally brought it to the realization par excellence - even if it was too late.
positive;If you haven't seen the movie yet, there's a couple of spoilers coming here, but you can't do it without them.
positive;The initial sequence was again super successful, even better than in the first two parts.
negative;For now the merciless slaughter is given meaning: The search for the last son of a woman who could fall in war, announced by irrevocably loud and sad music.
positive;No Q, no miracle weapons...
positive;"Peter Jackson made it clear through the ""Lord of the Rings"" films alone: he doesn't make cinemas, he makes big, huge, breathtaking cinemas - and in this modernized version of the classic from 1933 he found exactly the right material that he turns into a three-part epic."
positive;However, I find it a little unrealistic that Claire jumps around the whole movie with high heels, which is even explicitly indicated in the dialogue.
negative;But I rather found the beginning difficult, because one could not guess at this style.
positive;Alone the real theme of the film, World War, is already very interesting and in combination with Quentin Tarantino, who even in his film Hitler with an MP let solve, even more exciting.
positive;I'm by far no fan of this kind of movie.
negative;Who or what is the Circus?
positive;But with the duration it becomes clear that this man has an enormous personal moral code.
positive;Aviator was this weird biopic, and now I had to pull this mystery thriller in.
positive;At some point, he thinks he's not a real zebra.
positive;I can only recommend this to anyone
positive;Only one thing bothers me: Mel smokes like a vent.
negative;The action is powerful and good and scene set no question, but the rest of the movie is just weak !
positive;Right at the beginning the main characters of the film are introduced and the backgrounds of the Somali pirates are illuminated.
positive;But as well as that, all in all an excellently well made film, with clearly more value than can be assumed from so many film criticisms.
negative;Snipes and Antonio Banderas as Spaniards and a grandiose Harrison Ford who doesn't understand Statham's Brit-Akzent-Gemble, they all lack the event factor.
positive;"he experiences how a so-called ""nightcrawler"" makes recordings of a woman dying and sells these recordings to TV stations."
positive;Beautiful battle with lots of transformers-flair!
positive;The action scenes are actually rather spooky, but just the chase with the Batmobil is really well animated.
positive;The film focuses on dialogue and embeds the situation in a broad panorama of occupation, persecution of Jews, life and death, in order to reflect the world in these epic acts in the small moments and gestures.
negative;I have to praise the darker and fast-paced production and also at the actors there is nothing great to do.
negative;In my view, the only good thing about the movie was the first half hour.
negative;But apart from the hype (be it because of the characters, the books or only Fincher on the director's chair), all this is a maximum average thriller, which is sometimes a bit harder, but simply can't convince, because everything seems so unfocused.
positive;In summary, Avenger's part 2 is the current non-plus ultron of the big superhero blockbuster.
positive;The bitter end is known all the time.
positive;All this is brought over very convincingly by the actors, so that the mood of the film can be well staged.
negative;Krass?
positive;"I find the resulting film very valuable on two levels: on the one hand, because he deals with the Third Reich and the Holocaust issue, on the other hand, because he presents an antagonist who always only takes out from the evidence shown and given to him what seems appropriate to him and likes to conceal the rest and ""draws away"" - which seems to be very well-known when I hear some politicians argue and talk."
positive;The complete review now on Filmcheck!
negative;Conclusion: Filmic brainwashes at the coming together what doesn't necessarily belong together!
positive;The Dalai Lama, a person blessed with clever humor and deep wisdom, gives intelligent answers, which are always accompanied by a wink of the eye.
positive;And the more it does, the better of course.
positive;Alfred Molina is a real enrichment.
positive;Problems would only exist for these, the curse of the Caribbean could not know and thus get understanding difficulties.
positive;you must have seen the film.
positive;"Something I also liked about ""Contact"" was the lightness of the film, which makes it very pleasant and beautiful and yet not superficial and uninteresting."
negative;You don't get anything.
negative;Let's think about running to the movies.
positive;Ben Affleck can be so good if he wants to and Rosamund Pike is a revelation.
positive;so much is to be betrayed.
positive;Even if the film still leaves sufficient space for interpretation, it is made in the first place for informal dreams!
positive;But as a gay man, I see many criticisms here simply as hurting and appealing.
positive;"There is then also the abovepeinlich-sÃ1⁄4ffisante remark, that the dwarf next to Herkmliche weapons ""may have everything possible in the pants ""."
positive;The ammunition counter remains for once, only that has rarity value.
positive;I personally even found the movie relatively funny.
positive;"An anti-war film on the subject would be completely inappropriate, it would nevertheless have to bear the message that the victims had been ""senseless"" on the side of the Allies."
positive;It's not worse anymore - one may think - and if he finally hangs on the cross, let his head fall dying, one knows what redemption means.
positive;Well, I once led your reviews about this movie to gemüte and I agree with it for the most part!
positive;The typical feature of French cinematic art: laughter and crying closely together - is excellently implemented in many examples.
positive;Cottilard is also grandiose as an intriguing queen.
positive;As sympathetic as it seems at the beginning, every minute more light comes into the dark and suddenly one dares it quite to him.
positive;Genius actors, many beautiful scenes and moments!
positive;You sit comfortably in the armchair and enjoy the imagination, which authors, director and cast brilliantly put on display.
positive;Catched in his desires to do something important, to find his past, to be respected and coveted, he entangles himself ever deeper into the net, which has spun his beautiful neighbor.
positive;Cameron, may sometimes be surprisingly long with his characters, which can only be kept to his benefit and the film.
positive;Olaf is for me also the little secret star in The Ice Queen.
positive;An equally great praise can only be uttered to the actors.
positive;Hello, people.
positive;There rarely remains an eye dry.
positive;But the joy over wealth will only be short.
positive;A lot of action, cool look and a great cast.
positive;If this bond is made, then we love, then flowers grow us.
positive;------------------------------------------------------------------ complete review see:
positive;Since the end is already known to the viewer from the beginning, the psychological back and forth captivates the viewer even more at the event and lets with the persons with the fever.
positive;Nuit Noire is a bit, as if Franz Kafka had shot a film parallel to his books at the time.
positive;Lots of action, good story and a cool ending.
positive;There are no deep characters.
positive;I liked the movie very much.
negative;But the sequel is completely freed from all such attachments and just what it is: a perfectly constructed product.
negative;Conclusion: There is still a skid on it all over the place.
positive;Only after that can he be seen with thick glasses as Clark Kent.
negative;Greetings Andy
positive;In the other comments it was said that the movie is not exciting, that I find also, but for that he is funny and one experiences brotherly love.
positive;When the police have to let the only perpetrator go due to lack of evidence and the children do not reappear, one of the fathers (Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover) takes the investigation and the law into his own hands.
positive;I've written a review before.
positive;The film has just completely captivated one.
negative;So if you know and love the book, you should save yourself the visit to the cinema, in my opinion!
positive;I only saw this movie last night and can say that not only the film music is one of the best that ever existed, but that the scenes as well as the effects have succeeded very well.
positive;Why this movie is a satire is described in another review that is pretty good.
positive;It is also wonderful to see the spectacle of the four main actors, who obviously had a good time shooting, especially Woody Allen himself and the dreamlike Scarlett Johannson.
negative;And Gerard Butler has enough opponents in front of his chest that it doesn't get boring.
negative;very frustrating.
negative;Ready.
negative;Totally distasteful!
negative;I can't understand how to engage such bad actors in commercial film production.
positive;"But because obviously some ""experts"" here have neither understood the intention nor the manner in which this film was made, and are moving in their negative assessment to Terretorium, which is far from covered with ""taste difference"", I probably have to give the 10 to compensate."
positive;On top of that, many could take on the very slowed down pattern and find it very boring.
positive;This is a consideration of a young man who goes to war and then does everything there - just don't fight.
positive;But gradually more depth came over and I looked at it to the end.
positive;John Malkovich gives his Reverend Briegleb a determined determination in the fight against corruption and violence, but plays with generous reluctance in order not to push too far into the foreground.
negative;Kale doesn't like Ashley finding other friends, except him, and even having a party.
positive;One thing's for sure, Logan's a good movie!
positive;";-D"
negative;The story itself was quite nice, but implementation, well, I don't know.
positive;Star Wars, and I agree, is an epic, a heroic SciFi history with modern knights, not just Jedis!
positive;The actors are great, especially the character Dale did it to me, and the chemistry between his character and Allisson is incredible.
positive;By the way, the studio repeatedly denied that the film, like Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, would be shot and published with an increased frame rate of 48 frames per second, although director Singer had previously repeatedly been in love with this process.
positive;(more than normal) but who likes such films I can only recommend it !!
positive;I wonder about the many negative reviews here.
positive;"The fact that children behave strangely, or use ""comish influences"" is not bad anymore."
positive;This conflict, and the resulting winner, is an exciting and consistent implementation of the film.
positive;A great experience for people who have still preserved the dreams.
positive;Incredibly funny and naughty is this incredibly cool story of Juno telling which fantastic is portrayed by Ellen Page !
positive;Even the title of my review is full of superlatives, because these will not remain a rarity in my review!
positive;The sets are very elaborately made and the atmosphere, which the film captures is very successful.
positive;30 minutes less and the movie would be even better.
positive;Note: 1 Action/Comedy/Spannung: Of course the border sign of the movie is not the action, but since it also occurs I take it in here.
negative;This question we also clarified in the course of the film.
positive;"Burt Reynolds has a sense of humor: he plays a supporting role in a remake of his own film ""Die Kapfmaschine""."
positive;Perverts are movies like Hostel 2 or The Hills have Eyes 2, which
negative;"All in all, ""Disturbia"" is a really distasteful film, which ranks negatively with its genre colleagues."
positive;I think that was the best movie of the year.
positive;Contra: Some moments of the film are much too easy to integrate and destroy the ongoing distressing effect (such as aggression reduction through sex or the attic).
positive;Just as with the introduction, Singer does not waste much running time in his dark vision of the future, but instead creates the necessary feeling of apocalyptic threat through the first large action sequence (which is also one of the best) and lets exposure slide down and brings its time travel plot into the starting holes.
positive;Why don't the children trust anyone or why is the parents/adults never thematize what Bill and his troupe are up to.
positive;Above all, real values!
positive;This movie is great.
negative;Too bad about the missed time :-(
negative;Especially if one knows the relationships and knows that the calculation of the quotas in Germany are still a lot more accurate than e.g. in the media-controlled USA, so this whole construct flies quickly into each other, despite normal weaknesses at such a large survey.
positive;The actors are great, especially our two old stars.
negative;In between, the whole work runs neatly into the length.
positive;The movie is funny and inspiring at the same time.
negative;No avnung why you shoot a movie with which you can vomit due to the camera, which shakes stronger than an extremely bad mobile phone camera and which is published in 4KUHD.
negative;Chicago, in my opinion, is not necessarily a deserved oscar winner... in this film, there's just too much dancing and singing and yes, now many people will think that this film was no different to expect.
positive;Also the 30s, in which some scenes of the plot play are accordingly carefully represented.
positive;Unfortunately, the quite bad reviews (e.g., the cinema gave the movie the second worst rating) prevented me from seeing this movie at first.
positive;Especially the losers and insecure players have done it to the director.
positive;"Also in Germany the ""food trucks"" drive through the country and serve sometimes more than half chickens or fish rolls."
negative;"Immediately I had to think of ""The Golden Compass"", where the viewer was left with more questions than answers in the room and you never heard anything again."
positive;Just a great movie about a failed bank robbery with ingenious dialogues, a great cast, cool music and great direction!!
positive;I also liked the rest of the script very much, especially the completely crazy and crazy third act, which gives the whole movie a practically unpredictable turn (of course only if you don't know the book, like me) and is probably a prime example of the childly carefreeness of the movie, which I liked so much.
negative;The only thing that gives this strip a plus is the effects.
positive;In addition, war films are almost always too patriotic on the part of the Americans.
positive;In the midst of the waves I stand on a quaint beach, And I hold in my hand kings of the golden sand , Little, yet oh, they groan through the fingers of me , I must weep, weeping!
positive;It's worth seeing!
positive;Gallons of artificial blood.
positive;The film may not be as good as the first but still sensational he has more wit than the first but not as good in itself
positive;The content basis can be divided at first once into different measures.
negative;tränen der sun is not a film that can set the bar for other war movies higher.
positive;If you know what you're worth, go and get it.
negative;The movie is also full of primitive and sexist...
negative;It is a film with which you can pass the time, but since the director has not been in any way keen to experiment or willing to wane and has also proved little fingertip feeling, the whole seems unfortunately very fland.
positive;Otherwise, the film of course gets cult potential that it the foundation stone for the years later created crossover â€žAlien vs.
negative;Then it's about revenge just top.
positive;The movie took me pretty much with it, I went quite stiffened and accreted from the cinema.
positive;The talks in the movie are just cult!
positive;I'm sure.
positive;The sad music, which plays itself in the foreground, of course also must not be missing.
positive;I was in this brilliant movie yesterday and I'm still speechless!
positive;Makes you want a sequel.
positive;"As a ""normal"" citizen, one may not even imagine what injustice was then rampant, but this film is able to convey a part of it considerably."
negative;I mean, the kids are just in Narnia for a few days and fight with their given weapons as if they had spent years in it ... yes the oldest boy will even be carried over the leadership of Aslan's rebel army.
positive;"I've seen ""Departed"" twice and I think the movie is great in many ways."
positive;But above all Daniel Craig can sit down as the leading actor especially in scenes.
positive;more than just a romance, as the German suggests in contrast to the original title, but a deeply moving and profound film!
positive;What is then perhaps still too hard for some, is the representation of drugs and its consumption.
positive;For fans a celebration, for the rest of the world an immoral, tasteless stripe â€œ so exactly what â€œSouth Parkâ€ was and always wanted to be!Conclusion: Roughly drawn and tasteless cartoon comedy that understands against every decency and every norm â€œ one likes it or not!
positive;"Some of the characters appear and disappear after ten minutes; but the viewer will not forget them."
positive;This didn't happen for luck.
positive;Buy a large house with the Panic Room just mentioned.
positive;First of all, I have to say that I was drilled 77, but I had never seen a Rocky movie except for Rocky 5 or that I was never really interested in the genre boxing.
positive;Only rarely can one explain what has been seen and therefore moves in an unsafe float.
positive;The course of the action feels very good to me and leaves room for many details, which were then also introduced.
positive;This also makes it clear why Ridley Scott has been angry for so long if he should use the name.
positive;The music of John Williams has increased and now conveys more tension.
positive;The review of this movie can be found on my blog, where I will publish almost daily contributions :)
positive;I watched the movie alone and I was late that night and I was really scared.
positive;Smaller logic solvers or other unsolved questions such as :Spoiler: Why does Chris Pratt run around with such a mercy weapon or why do the old Jurassic Jeeps jump on together with the old battery ?, don't let me take the fun of the movie.And even if the finale was a bit too much, I thought it was cool.
positive;With his gang members, he successfully performs lucrative coups in the Los Angeles area.
positive;The frame action and the film music let the visitor immerse themselves in the world of dramatic symphonic poetry, but with lots of wit, humor and irony.
positive;As a 79's year it was a great wish of me to experience the legendary Rocky balboa once life in the cinema.Today this desire has gone into fulfillment.Together with my father I enjoyed 105 min. emotional, sophisticated cinema for the soul.This film is made my opinion for people with heart, power and positive energy.
negative;Just bad, badly played with an expression from the 21st century, hardly any tension.
positive;Violence, prostitution, sex, and abortion are on the agenda here and are presented unsparingly.
positive;Those who look forward to X-Men 3 ,Ghost Rider,Superman Returns and now Spiderman 3 on qualitatively good and sometimes challenging comic films will be very disappointed in the future.
positive;How he slowly understands, how he reacts and how this is represented, I find grandiose.
positive;"A small note, however, still exists...the kind of ""futuristic"" pistols there really is, with fires of 3 shots are delivered."
positive;Convince the characters and the story is excitingly built up.
positive;There would be first the course of action.
positive;He wants to be as glorious as he is one day.
positive;The actors play excellently and the nomination for 5 Oscars is more than justified.
positive;A closer experience would probably only offer a holiday trip.
positive;And - hui... with the memory of once, this haunted story worked fine.
negative;Part is trying to print everything on megacool and many spades have been taken over from the first part, but only appear like a cheap slippage whereby the movie completely loses the flair of the first part Although I'm the biggest fan of Boondock Saints, the 2nd already revealed me in the first quarter of an hour.
positive;I see this as an audience movie that you must have seen when you're interested in classical music - and maybe even then, if not.
positive;Only the end I personally did not like so much now but that one has to decide for itself.
positive;Wow, that's a hell of a movie.
negative;Fort of painted, one-dimensional kitsch, towards the ambivalent complexity.
positive;The target is a fort.
positive;Only Adam Beach in the very interesting role of the Indian Ira, who is subject to continuous racial prejudices, gives the tragedy of his figure a oppressive, profound and distressing expression and reflects equally uncomfortable, American truths.
positive;But the absolutely ingenious story will easily get out of it again.
positive;Time and again the camera searches the actors and leaves time to spread their feeling world on the screen.
positive;However, it is presented at such a quiet pace that one gets an idea of how economy, crime and politics interact.
positive;"All those who think this film is ""pro-Nazi"" didn't understand anything at all!"
positive;Only the two CGI figures fall off strongly.
positive;It reflects all the emotions in me that were in the attack at that time... It's hard to believe that people, by their faith, are too good and that thousands of others are going to die.
negative;As a story in itself this is ok, if not special, in the wobble camera look the number is almost irreplaceable.
positive;This will surely be solved with another enjoying the movie.
negative;Or did the makers just want to make a comedy that takes on different genres?
negative;What you get to see, however, is less surprising.
negative;We have seen the film so overloaded and clichéd that we left the hall before the end of the film when it became clear to us how the stories would end.
positive;Only I would have wanted an even more exciting and veiled story here, which would have been quite possible with the film.
positive;Not only for chess fans A great, exciting and dedicated played and produced biopic about Bobby Fisher, his life and his world championship fight against Boris Spassky in Reykjavik in 1972.
negative;This movie is complete nonsense, and then also quite boring.
positive;This film is not only a must for historians, but also for all those who just want to enjoy and relax.
positive;To laugh and smile you can decide for the MCU, and for dark atmospheres DCEU.
negative;If you are just about to make a nice evening with the Exorsist, the Omen and more, then you can without any hesitation reach back to the Exorzisum of Emily Rose.
negative;It feels as if one had only to create an emotional film, a story that should address as many people as possible.
negative;The story is weak.
positive;I don't think we've seen John McLane for the last time.
positive;With every look, every tone and every gesture, he is fully in his role and corrupts gay activist Harvey Milk in a way that is beyond any doubt.
positive;But, well, that's just a marginal aspect that probably hardly anyone will notice.
negative;I'm still in the ev.
negative;Well, what can you say?
positive;"My conclusion: like to be on the big screen; definitely as a DVD!"
positive;I would actually only like to know a little more about the criminal magician.
negative;"This time as occult witch-jäger; with a spark â€žHighlanderâ€œ with in it â€¢ unfortunately only without a chance."
positive;That at the beginning Wallace as a child who has lost his father is brilliant.
negative;Better than the 1st.
positive;Where in the last genre the SprÃ¶derie often prevailed and the beauty was sought rather in the reality rather than â€TM alienation (see â€TMLike Crazyâ€œ or â€TMThe taste of rust and boneâ€œ), â€TMLaurence Anywaysâ€œ is a luminous prism, a dispersive image rush that does not plasticize the sensations, usually transcends them visually in support, but also defies them several times.[...]
positive;You should take a look!
positive;The actors have all world class levels, the backdrops are also excellent, the story sensational and the best: - I was extra!!!!
positive;"After seeing parts of the ""Passion of Christ"" (couldn't have done the film to me) I first feared the worst."
positive;"For many films ""The Crazies"" certainly also serves as the basis, if you take a closer look at the story of ""28 Days Later""."
positive;Although there is something missing from the close combat inlays, perhaps it really makes more sense that a Hitman is more focused on weapons than on close combat.
positive;what a benevolent after many pseudo-demanding films of the last time, which were simply just enthralling boring.
positive;A solid film with an interesting message.
negative;Here little attention to detail is proved and many scenes seem overwhelming.
positive;How's that?
positive;This skepticism, however, turned into enthusiasm in the course of the film.
negative;Even the actors with charm could not make up for this, because in the end I really hoped that there was a deeper sense between the whole stranger.
negative;Somewhere I read that the film was exhausting, among other things.
positive;Here everything is just right, especially succeeded I also find, as the viewer the atmosphere of the New York of the 30s is conveyed.
positive;empathetic and accurate.
positive;You can only pull the hat before this performance to fascinate children and adults!
positive;He has a lot to think about, and if you do that, this movie is more or less a revelation...
positive;With â€žBowling for Columbineâ€œ Michael Moore succeeded in the sensation par excellence: a documentary that is entertaining and funny with all the terrible things she shows ruthlessly.
positive;This too is so unusual.
positive;The movie is simply a MUST for all country fans.
positive;Unfortunately Til Schweiger unveils for the role of the Basterd Hugo Stieglitz.
positive;Super ingenious fun entertainment !!
positive;Nevertheless, I find 'Determining' recommended.
negative;In between you sometimes feel literally like in the wrong movie, because one seems to have gone to the connection.
positive;The film is a thousand times better than the predecessor and freezed the blood in my veins.
positive;Only the genius of the story convinces, the rest also.
positive;You rarely see such an adorable, black-humored movie from Hollywood.
positive;But still really worth seeing.
positive;Great.
negative;However, I have to criticize the camera leadership.
negative;I want a nice movie night
positive;No film that anecks or intellectual art critics inspires but simply and poignantly that does what a film is now damnedly produced......to entertain.
positive;The film has so much tension that you almost can't hold it to the end.
positive;Parents need to talk to their children after a movie.
positive;SUPPLEMENTATION OF ME!!
negative;13.
positive;Batman was out of the superheroes, just because of the darker comics of the beloved.
negative;"Also the sentence from the Potsdam conference, ""We want peace for the world"" is a little too little if one wants to draw a comparison with the wars still waged today (Enduring freedom "")."
positive;A very strong, towards the end even slightly disturbing film.
positive;"Of course, one wants to be entertained in the cinema, and escape from this everyday life, but with all this blockbuster crap that is constantly filmed, where the motto is called ""ÅÅ"" the more expensive the better (which unfortunately is not true in most cases) Benjamin Button stands out very clearly."
positive;Does anyone, whether it is worth it, look at the other too?
positive;Furthermore, the traps and death scenes have also been implemented very well.
negative;If it was still possible to save itself in the original cases of the bodies, it is now impossible.
negative;[...]It's always the same when the aniston walks up into these R-rated comedys, coquetting with the sexyness of the 40's and cramping off Swearwords: none of these outbreak attempts from the scheme of the heartwarm RomCom is as good or even as funny as he could be and it occasionally suggests itself.[...
positive;But where is it written that Bond just has to look horny?
negative;But what then came out is probably not everyone's business.
negative;It was my fault.
negative;The insights into Bond's childhood and thus his psyche remain absolutely superficial, also the relationship to M, which is probably supposed to represent something like a surrogate mother, becomes not tangible at all.
positive;It is precisely the supposedly simple and obvious things that are difficult to realize.
positive;In the film I especially liked the little things that gradually dissolve, such as the poem at the beginning or his sick wife...
positive;This is done through the perfect interplay of optics and acting.
positive;What she now finds out, and why it is just as it is, is simply very exciting presented and one feels with Lisa and wishes that it finds a good end.
positive;But who seriously expects this in a Hollywood romantic comedy?
positive;In a chapter of the film, the origins of anarchism are discussed.
positive;The gags are fired once again in the second cycle and are naturally also here again very dull.
positive;You're bound to the whole movie about the story.
positive;The moral club does not always have to be unpacked.
negative;"Where ""Avatar"" still works with a message, the happening here runs like pulled on a cord and completely without a goal."
negative;Here would be to call the thing with Santa Claus.
positive;I can only say for myself that I was rarely so long and so intensely shocked by a film and thought so long about a film as intensely as with Antichrist.
negative;One can over the dummy story, which, sometimes aside from the main character almost completely overreacting rest of the cast (each of the of the patch with tits and rubber lips writes it would have been good or even better than bad can never have seen well), the completely unnecessary excesses, the completely wacky, downright medieval patriotism (I'm really not an American opponent, but I also don't run constantly with a German flag), one(or more?)
positive;That was really good conversation.
positive;With Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce, the film has three leading actors who make the film what it is.
negative;On the one hand, the stowed individual has spared no cost and money to play with his victims lifeguard games.
positive;Conclusion: First-class follower with high fun factor and equally high proportion of quieter and melancholic moments!
positive;"Somehow ironically the AN in Sam Mendes is visibly paid tribute to the ""jarhead"" - because the latter one notice its origin from the Bush-Ã""ra clearly above all the, in order to secure the support by the US Army, but quite tame system criticism."
positive;I just came from the cinema and despite medium reviews I am quite impressed by this film.
negative;Parker wants to get married, the symbiote goes to earth, J.J.
positive;"""Prince Avalanche"" is a film of insinuations and dialogues."
negative;I expected more.
positive;Of course she feels sexually attracted to him for a little moment.
positive;The effects are fantastic, the 3D effect is however quite overcrowded, though well implemented.
negative;Otherwise, it is technically quite well implemented, the scenes have succeeded.
negative;The synchronize itself also her dodel!
positive;Entertainment people, who doesn't like it, listens away.
positive;That came already so often on television that he actually had to get his own TV channel.
positive;Anyway, well done.
positive;All in all but a really nice entertaining time in the South Seas (cinema).
negative;The actors act well in Harry Potter except for some exceptions, especially Ron can really amuse from time to time.
positive;Zambrano creates an indescribable mood, playful, cheerful but also dramatic and sad, like a bluesjam.
positive;And that in a way, about which I mior myself am not yet clear.
negative;Simply as it is, it needs the immediate and directly comprehensible connection to the reality, without which its play is created to involuntary comedy.
positive;Bloody scenes are thus absolute shortages and zombie fans can be quite disheartened in this point.
positive;Some will find them quite great, others quite terrible, as can already be seen from the previous reviews.
positive;John Rabe, the Frenchwoman and the English doctor) really live along.
positive;Without him, this movie would only be half as good.
positive;With the poster for this film, I really liked it - especially because the German marketing department still had to pop a Christmas tree to the left in the picture - here in this film there is nowhere Christmas (and on the US motif you also search for a fir in vain).
negative;The three hours would have been possible even on 90min.
positive;I think he definitely belongs to the best films ever made in the Western hemisphere.
positive;Buy yourself a palete bum beer or two yes according to how much you are.Small tip: The beer that the guys from Newkids drink at Aldi Nord when you've been peeking and living in the south goes to Penny there give the dirtiest.
negative;Commenting the injured Tarantino fansoul speaks.
positive;The whole thing because you want five seats.
negative;And despite my wise foresight that nothing special would expect me, and my ability to win something off, it was increasingly difficult for me to ignore the involuntary comedy inherent in the universe of the shield-winging creature in the increasing course of the action.
positive;A character development that was apparently caused by the adventure, however, is not visible at any time and therefore does not feel deserved.
positive;In addition, it is sometimes something new than the archetypal actions of some other horror movies.
negative;Stargate by Roland Emmerich apparently belongs to his best works.
negative;This would have been such a good movie, if he would only not be so completely illogical!
positive;All supporting actors also move on a solid level.
positive;Even after 13 years !
positive;The film was very well received by the press as well as by most viewers.
negative;The story is lukewarm, the characters and actors stay flat, the action is true for long distances.
positive;Is that real now or is that dirty andrew?
positive;Unfortunately, the audience numbers were not really satisfactory, which I also return to the just mentioned point.
positive;"I myself, however, rather desperately looked for a real high point because it is very difficult to find favourite scenes out of many really well succeeded scenes...but I think everyone should look at a movie ""the other art"" and give the title a chance"
positive;I read the book only after the movie and am not quite sure if that was good, Ford I imagine after the book somehow like an ugly pigman with red hair, because I think of Mos Def.
positive;Unobtrusive and sensitive, great actors, well filmed and covered with appropriate music.
positive;Great comedy!
positive;Gosling just doesn't take a look.
positive;Horny effects and a very good atmosphere (the story on the other hand is relatively weak)!
negative;Not only do they bring nothing to the film (characters such as Storm (Alexandra Shipp) or Psylocke (Olivia Munn) are completely without character properly heated), no, they also bring nothing to Apocalypse, which can also be taken increasingly less seriously, if in the first half of the film he only deals with redressing his 4 riders.
positive;Finally again a Bruce Willis Movie after old, proven construction.
positive;I have to admit, although Tim Burton is a class director and Edward Scissorhands is always quoted as a classic, I have always tried to make a bow to this supposedly bizzare children's tale.
positive;Especially Will Poulter as a racist policeman or Algee Smith as a singer Larry totally convinced me.
positive;While the viewer has to deal with changed life situations in the Before sections, he experiences the change himself at â€žBoyhoodâ€œ.
positive;I'm just saying HAMMER voltage, GENIAL Action and BRILLIANTE actors make the movie Martin Scorsese's best movie ever.
positive;And so the game of Christian Bale is not bad, as often criticized.
positive;"It is definitely and here I quote the makers, ""creative experiment with and homage to the usual, what else is done with classical music""."
positive;Conclusion: A must to think about the human being in a great staging and good cast.
positive;The supporting characters are sometimes more intense than Stauffenberg, which seems rather striking, almost like a clean comic figure, American halt.
positive;Even if there is no happy end, he employs the viewer still after the end.
positive;"Full score..a masterful template masterfully transformed... a masterpiece just ;)"
positive;"The boundaries between good and evil blur here and it is revealed so that a black-and-white thinking has never been appropriate, since religion can say nothing about the individual character of a person - on each side there are ""precious"" and ""fanatic"" personalities."
positive;Personally, I find Blade Runner an absolutely visual and timeless masterpiece, an almost nitch-like existential film.
positive;Of course one could have done the one or the other better or different, but okay.
positive;Also came many nice allusions in there (among other things n nice sidekick towards Warner Bros.
positive;and the history that one deletes a targeted memory by the wonders of medicine, is also decades old.
positive;"Kane's last word was ""Rosebud"" just before his death."
positive;Here the topic of racial hatred is pointed out and embeds it in a child-friendly story.
positive;Gosling as a silent hero is just great.
positive;I just love this movie.
positive;!I hope you enjoy playing with the scenes, where I envy them of course too!!
positive;Even if it is very demanding, one does not lose the overview.
positive;But this role is entertaining anyway.
negative;"For he is about the American military, about a single family, about two giant bat monsters who want to mate, and about a time bomb; the film is NOT about Godzilla._____________ Who wants to watch the film because of Bryan Cranston should let it stay."
negative;You have to be quite an alien fan to survive the very long-breathed story without yawns.
positive;Doesn't talk much, but rots pretty much everything that runs him over the way, great performance.
positive;If the whole thing at first glance may be unusual for Mr. Eastwood, he has always struck very gentle clay.
positive;He's so warm and you're always looking forward to Christmas.
positive;Tom Hanks deserves the Oscar as the best leading actor.
negative;The female lead Laura Haddock turns out in her role of Viviane Wembley as a mimic tube creator.
positive;"In addition, he stimulates reflection and contains, so to speak, ""life-proofs""."
positive;the film has succeeded all around.
positive;Fucking funny movie you can't just watch.
positive;"In the beginning and in the end, short scenes come from the ""Conjuring"" films, which you only understand in connection if you have not only seen ""The Nun"", but the film itself stands stable for itself and does not refer to any other films."
negative;Unfortunately, I was disheartened: The camera management should probably lead to tension and reality.
negative;Therefore: 1 out of 5 points.
negative;Why isn't Scotty discovered on the approach to the station where the Dreadnaught is apparently being built?
positive;I'm just getting on my nerves about getting pulled over America all the time.
positive;"Clint Eastwood managed with ""The Foreign Son"" once again a strong, exciting drama, which does not have to shy away the comparison with Oscar-Abräumern like ""Million Dollar Baby""."
positive;Prisoners is still not a political film.
positive;A must for every fan of German comedies.
negative;Just too embarrassing the performance of John Malkovich.
positive;No crazy, turnful story you have to follow.
positive;So if you don't think it's good, you either didn't see it completely finished, you don't understand it.
negative;The leading actor has no depth, you have no idea how he became what he is.
positive;To me: My expectations were exceeded with certainty...
positive;I'm thrilled.
positive;The Green Mile is a really super beautiful movie.
positive;I am 14 years old myself and go to a high school with an average grade of 1.3.
positive;Uaaaaa!
positive;She is a rich and a spoiled God.
positive;Around him are also good actors who do their thing well.
positive;And the father is also bought from him.
positive;The special feature of this is of course that it is a true case and the cinematic main characters have written in real the book that is implemented.
negative;The basic idea is great but the film is for the ton.
negative;If there's a third part, I'll definitely give up.
negative;At least the finale offers a bit more speed and at least smaller surprises.
positive;one of the most brutal movies of his time!!
positive;For me, the fascination of this film has revealed that all these things were transferred convincingly into the present and a decisive message is ready: freedom is the most important good on earth and all attempts to contain it, to arrest and torture people willingly, must be suffocated at any cost in the bud if the use in a later stage is not to become much higher!
negative;McGuire and DiCaprio alone are suitably occupied and I would like to see them in a more intimate and natural staging of the Gatsby fabric.
positive;That has to do film, to show people the way they are.
positive;"For this performance alone, Saoirse Ronan would earn the Oscar in the category ""Best leading actress""."
positive;Can't remember, for example, about Rose and Jack in Titanic having experienced a lot of childhood.
positive;Also a great movie of the series, which you can watch again and again and laugh!
negative;So one day you let yourself be carried away to look at him in the evening program, in order to be convinced of his greatness.
negative;The basically well-arranged story loses itself towards the end during the whole strip to an unfermented, unambitious bliss.
positive;The movie is awesome people.
positive;the film itself is also not too bright ala marvel but also not as thirsty as bvs, has a healthy center between the two.
positive;The movie is very well played and entertaining.
negative;But I don't think it's a very good movie.
negative;"I don't want to talk so much about the film itself, everything has been said about it in the review... Just to the taste ""True Story"": Fact is: it's NOT based on a true story."
positive;Despite some lengths, this comÃ¶die was what it is supposed to be funny.
negative;Spoiler: Now she is big and is more or less with a boy who has match-making, all clear... Conclusion: Epic is a loveless movie that seems completely irrelevant to him afterwards and probably only what is for the very small one.
positive;The acting performance is simply top for both the children and the witch.
negative;He just wants to shock with his medieval approach.
negative;Yes, two low-budget productions to interact with extraterrestrials that are already more frequent.
positive;Here no prisoners are made, no mercy given and the bodies are really evil...
positive;"Because in ""Vanilly Sky"" you experience by far the best Tom Cruise."
negative;In the Sächsische Schweiz (that would have become the horror potential)?
positive;Other filmmakers would have missed the story to the front and back again 10 extra minutes, this one brings his stuff through in about 90 minutes, delivers on the one hand well thought-out characters, but also dispenses with unnecessarily â€žFüllmaterialâ€.
negative;When I saw him in the cinema, I found him still good at first, a good, boisterous degree for the trilogy.
positive;Once in the print medium, I could not completely follow the path of the characters, whereby the fabric and especially the end for me strongly at quality.
positive;I went into the movie with very big expectations and was, whether you believe it or not, still surprised!
positive;The whole thing is crowned by a long, final chase through the jungle.
positive;Colin Farrell's character constantly tries to explain to everyone how he wants to combine a brutal screenplay about seven psychopaths with a story about love and peace in a film.
positive;The record speed is very moderate and the whole thing is definitely not an action film, however I found the story relatively interesting, especially psychologically.
positive;In this environment, the story of a sad love relationship is subtly described – one that cannot and must not be – and is described with all the heights and depths and ends plausibly and honestly.
negative;"Abrams is right with his statement: ""This film cannot fulfill the high expectations""."
negative;"In order to make no doubt come up, one of the protagonists says in a scene, since he is already spitting blood on the ground: ""I'm not feeling well""."
negative;as loud as that may sound.
positive;No one who goes in there comes out again.
positive;"So also a friend of mine afterwards said: ""I don't see all this stuff at all."
positive;In turn, the nameless must report how he defeated them.
positive;Here are no mystical sword masters at work, but hard-fed warriors and soldiers who had to pay their teaching money with blood: And so they fight.
positive;"And it's the actors, just as much Tom Hanks as the actors of the kidnapper who develop an incredible presence.This film is traded with high Oscar chances â€"" rightfully."
positive;The movie is also worth seeing for people who don't want to see Zac, especially because the TV Spot provides a completely different picture about the movie.
positive;In the course of the film, incredibly profound and grandiose dialogues emerge, which have absolute cult factor and remain in the audience for a very long time.
positive;One sees how the sun rises over the icy city of Sydney and thus the hope of life has not yet expired.
negative;Unfortunately, even after a hundred minutes, that just doesn't want to happen.
positive;First of all, Jared Leto's performance must be guaranteed in this great movie with standing ovations.
negative;The other boy, Columbus, is still to be endured, just like the two girls, but dialogues or talks about which I could laugh about, they also did not have in mind.
positive;My result: Good, but not as good as the proponents.
positive;What I can't understand is that many criticize that the film is unrealistic!
positive;Finally a really nice Bully movie.
positive;I don't want to reveal anything about the content of the story, since this is what makes the tension sp like the surprise of the film.
negative;Some side plots one would have been able to give himself quite.
positive;I can only say a few words to the movie, he came so real, that I still can't believe it.
negative;Still a lot of fun with the look!
negative;"In the figure of Robinson the utopia arises only before the eyes of the reader, by the hero, because of his courage, self-confidence and the infinite hope so sympathetic, passes through the ""civilization process en miniature"", thus a manageable cultural genre."
positive;Naomi Rapace also stands out here, not because she looks after Sigourney Weaver, but instead plays her own down-to-earth character (something more subtle).
positive;However, pride and arrogance bring this down, he refuses to support the sound film idea and collapses financially and psychologically like a house of cards.
positive;After many hopeless conversations with Thorin, who has meanwhile made himself comfortable again in his mountain, the subsequent story about the return of Sauron and the ring wars will not completely forget, why the orcs, above all the pale Ork, always participate in the event.
positive;A detailed review on the Filmchecker Blog!
positive;It is a struggle with the wrong means, but it is a struggle whose goals speak out of the soul of many people.
positive;I can't understand the actors who are involved in this.
positive;Was a really good movie showing the friendship is very important and that children with their fantasy can charm themselves their own Little World.But if I find the movie as an adult already sad how a child has to react to the movie.
positive;And even that, although nothing big can surprise you.
positive;Even Tom Cruise knows how to convince without knowing before, I would never have recognized him.
positive;Civil war in Burma, main venue of John Rambo.
positive;In a church Barney Ross picks up the frame data of the potential next order and here they meet, the concentrated bodies of the 1980s.
positive;In addition, there are wonderful landscape photos on top!!
positive;In advance, I have to admit, he belongs to my absolute favorite movies and I know only a few action films which can offer parallel here slogans.The synchronisation is perfectly succeeded, a tick better even than the original.The atmosphere, the gags, the performance of the actors and even the plot have succeeded compared to other consorts of this genre first of all.One can watch it again and again,which maybe also lies with Erika Eleniak,which just looks away from Baywatch class :).
negative;The latte was very high for this movie after Skyfall and Casino Royal.
positive;Tom Hardy is the most heard in the movie and gives a strong ¶sewicht.
positive;Cinema of the finest, people!
positive;In general, however, there is nothing wrong with the dramaturgy.
positive;He draws his tension mainly from the contrast between the unconditional will to survive and the moral value system.
positive;Whoever saw the movie probably knows what I mean.
positive;Firefly, the series, and Serenity, the film - this is today and this is the future of intelligent and exciting science fiction!
positive;Why?
positive;Certainly most will not be able to warm up so much for this movie and can therefore safely deduct 1 to 2 points.
negative;So I understand the hype there seems to be around this movie at the back and at the front.
positive;Action: 4.5 stars I have to deal with it a little bit.
positive;"For an amusing and exciting film evening is ""Bank Job"" so only highly recommended!!"
positive;"the film is funny, there is a lot of action with it, brilliant actors and in terms of content he is also good maybe there is also a third ;) so I can only recommend the film !"
positive;Black also stages more complex.
positive;However, this interplay of music and images makes this film worth seeing and therefore also comes out without great action like some other science fiction film.
positive;The film is already 16 years old and already so often on TV, but still makes fun again and again.
positive;The soundtrack does its rest.
positive;The main character of Adam Sandler, which tends to provoke anger and insecure behavior, is portrayed, and this magnificent!
negative;Despite the good acting performances of Brenton Thwaites, Alicia Vikander, and of course Ewan McGregor, who stands out the most, it is not enough for more however.
positive;Currently the film is definitely better than the current games!
negative;may be something for little girls but absolutely nothing for women's evenings.
positive;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is simply due to good preliminary work that Marvel can get out a trump in every scene that works directly.
positive;I could hardly imagine E.Wood as a hooligan but he is the perfect cast.
positive;Some are very exciting, others a little more action-packed (in part also really hard), other scenes are also just quiet and beautiful to watch.
positive;So the relationship between Larry and Anna develops, as if it were predestined, by a prank of Dans.
positive;Quite clearly a funny, caotic film about the magic of the first love.
positive;Anyone who has even a hint of what true horror can mean will discover a true masterpiece in this film.
negative;Now to the second part it is naturally against a revenge thriller but only a few stories from the first part are warmed up.
positive;Stupid as I am but I give all 3D versions their chance and when mcih flashes something, you get it first.
positive;When I first saw Funny Games on TV, I couldn't believe what I saw.
positive;The special effects are just as fantastic.
negative;Although I'm a fan of Natalie, I find the movie weak... kitsch ala club of the dead poets...
positive;The film proves impressively how people with completely different needs can perfectly indulge themselves.
positive;Josh Lucas, who usually subscribes to Fieslinge, scores completely as a heart-good, lovable dirt patch, in addition, thereâ€TMs the whole small town pile.
positive;Not only that this film shows the life of a really there, it is simply different in all matters.
positive;"A beautiful story about an old lady who takes on a youthful ""criminal""."
positive;Just that he was still an American answer to the genre.
positive;"""The whole rage, only generates more rage"" yes so you can sum up the topic, which can also be transferred well to current world political events."
positive;Which consequences result from this, yes, the film is about it and that is really pretty much what importance the smartphone and the Internet have nowadays.
negative;We understood it: cliché of an embarrassing wedding speech, impossible type, bride has best friend of the brother....jajaja!
positive;The poor really takes with them every fat button, because it does not allow itself to bend.
negative;On the whole, however, the acting is rather in the lower average.
positive;I didn't see him again until yesterday.
positive;In the middle of the film with one of the best film scenes I have ever seen.
positive;Black Rain is for me something like a distant relative of Blade Runner.
negative;==References==
positive;"""A Whole New World""."
positive;Yes well the movie goes its own way yet Episode 7 is simply Episode 4.
positive;Beautiful music, great actors and everything implemented with heart.
positive;It is not just a trick, as he claims, but can only be found in the transcendent realm of human existence, to say: Only in faith in God, who then gives knowledge, lies the answer to all questions.
positive;With Gleeson, you're feverish all the time, you're so unplanned, and you're standing between the fronts just like him.
positive;I think the movie is really cool.
positive;Italowester meets Politthriller and the whole thing is well done.
negative;Non- and Jungtrekker get action food from the household can, trekkies of the first hour are brushed and SF fans are - as so often in the last years - confronted with the insight that the genre no longer filmed new ideas, no groundbreaking concepts, but relies on the safe cashier ideas.
positive;I bet you have to see him a few more times to get all the jokes, allusions and ambiguities.
positive;Dany Dehaan as Harry Osborn is definitely worth a mention, because in my opinion he is the best actor and at the same time the most interesting character in the movie.
positive;"Choose a large screen at the bedside; IMAX is ideal."
negative;What's left in the morning after the movie night?
positive;Rarely have there been movies where both would have so much fun.
positive;Since many of my colleagues anticipated me of this film, I bought 13 then one day.. I find the film on the one side a little overtaken but actually everything is right..
positive;It doesn't stop when the (often unloved) wobble camera is used.
positive;A timeless masterpiece.
positive;a story that could hit anyone who has a family.
negative;This won't last a year...!
positive;Harry Osborn and Electro, who always care with their participation for highlights.
negative;Everything seems too overloaded, too gigantic.
positive;In addition, General Zod (Shannon) with his revolution.
negative;What are you doing?
positive;"And that with a sci â€"" Fi â€"" adventure, in which one is already of the opinion, at least as a movie lover, to have seen everything."
positive;Despite the relatively small budget of $25 million, the apocalypse and the emerging creatures look really good.
positive;"""Cheap Thrills"" has much more to offer than that."
negative;Those who followed this at the time will not be able to win much off the film.
positive;Definitely worth seeing!
positive;For splatter is also taken care of by the way, because it already flows abundantly blood.
positive;In a movie like this one doesn't really have the feeling of watching a feature film, but as if someone simply pictured the reality â€ bleak, close to reality, dirty.
positive;Especially at the end one would have noticeably to mention Spoiler: , especially the final slaughter part I, which appears more than redundant.
negative;Quite nonsense story with nice effects and a very good idea at the ''ship sink'' (Battleship).
positive;A film that only talks for ninety minutes, but which is nevertheless more exciting and more cohesive than any action film.
positive;A few more words about the story.
negative;Some jokes shown in the trailer are missing.
negative;Soderbergh's sequel takes over with his playful story, also wants to seem cool and instead seems rather exhausting, because no clear lines can be seen in the story and the director knows no new sides to his characters.
negative;But if you are looking for action with a little sense and maybe level should put on another movie.
positive;I think the movie's pretty good.
positive;I just pushed through the TV newspaper and looked at it, which was simply an absolute joy hit.
positive;Wonderful scenery and good actors.
positive;It begins where chaos and uncertainty end.
positive;No exaggerated meaningful dialogues, no raised index finger.
negative;The story's got something.
positive;It's one of the best Christmas movies I've seen.
negative;"But this ""highpoint"" is unfortunately the only one the film has to show."
positive;Who after the pleasure of Black Hawk Down has the feeling that war is a cool thing and to die for his fatherland is an uplifting feeling, has definitely other problems.
positive;His parents treat him like a property, he was already small, he was not told that he had a stepbrother, he had to watch his parents fight.
positive;20 min.
negative;"I'm not a racist or anything, but I hate the Americans,ey."""
positive;But the movie just deserves it!
positive;Paul W.S.
positive;Hope that at least one of the thousands of refugees will be able to realize a better life.
positive;"Through the mythical films like ""Tiger&Dragon"" or ""Hero"" I became a new fan of the Martial Arts cinema, whereby I have just discovered something of the ""soul of China"", which I always lacked with the traditional thigh-knock-Hongkong blockbusters of older style and often pulled the whole thing into the mystery."
positive;"The reviews for the sequel to ""Sin City"" were mixed and I have to say quite clearly: ""A Dame To Kill For"" is a very successful sequel that maintains the level of his predecessor."
positive;Thus begins a lengthy dispute over spiritual and political supremacy in MÃ¤hren.
positive;And it really has it in it.
positive;Excellently thought-out the whole thing... a high on the scriptwriter.
positive;As already said, the movie is incredibly beautiful to watch, also the electronic music fits great and the performers fit.
positive;"Conclusion: Forman dresses the fight of the ordinary, strict and god-fearing man Salieri against the intoxicated, lustful and truly blessed genius Mozart, at whose end the victor could call ""God(s child) is dead and I, only I am his child "", but ultimately still in the face of the actual defeat despaired, in a fantastic dress of music (not any, we are talking here about the well-great musical genius of all time), colorful tastes and backdrops and an unusual but ingenious archetypal structure."
positive;Instead of finally taking the position of one of the two parties, there is an acceptable solution for both sides, but no clear solution.
positive;Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall make their work fantastic.
positive;A rare case in which the original was surpassed...
positive;You have fun watching the movie and that without the movie drifting into a comedy.
positive;So what Sony Pictures delivered was really impressive.
positive;The best horror movie I know!
positive;When for the first time Frank appears in the very desired food, which so a bit awakens the thought, the film would be a satire on horror movies.
positive;In the gore genre, this movie is really top-notch.
positive;Finally, one more thing about the zombies.
positive;"I had to see the lucky ""W."" on the start day in the USA."
positive;His game, his whole presence is simply great and encourages his character into the top league of movie villains.
negative;Too bad this cult figure isn't the one she used to be years ago.
positive;"The most likely reason, however, is that this story is basically a remake of ""Taxi Driver""."
positive;Even if the protagonists are partly only indirectly connected with each other and only individuals of them meet at the end of the film, and thus no real solution takes place, this film is nevertheless great class.
positive;Now only the presentation of the film, the actors, the story, the music.
positive;Acting, of course, you have to speak about Alden's kingdom of honour, who is stepping in huge footsteps.
negative;He saves the man from his lashes and must finally flee himself... Laaaaaan-like and illogical...
positive;But it is not supposed to represent the reality, no, it creates a poppy-bonbon-colored art world and burns a fireworks display of timeless songs, dance performances and singing.
positive;Adding to this is the great film music by Hans Zimmer, which makes the film a masterpiece.
positive;Just a golden cage.
positive;When I see Taken dismantled.
positive;Ridley Scott succeeded in perfect manner in humming a sophisticated and meaning-faltering story in the guise of a commercial film.
negative;Certainly it was clear that the film translation could not take over every storyline of the good and tricky story of the book, but what was delivered here is already funny.
negative;So if that were the first Resident Evil movie I'd ever seen, I'd hate the movie series.
positive;Will Smith and Kevin James form the perfect pair of canvases together and can convince in their roles.
positive;One of the main actors is shown with real fat acne in the face and very crooked upper edges, I've never seen anything like that in the movie, in real life already more often.
positive;There was a place in the movie where I had to laugh very much.
positive;Even if some of them report about the effects of the story, this is not a typical popcorn movie, where everything is explained and performed.Why do people react differently?
negative;The actually interesting character of Steve Buscemi has an incredible potential, but is treated so superficially and prejudicingly that it hurts to look at it soon.
positive;For me 10 out of 10 points, alone for the kitschy music and Patrick Dempsey large recordings:o)
positive;It's worth it!
positive;In doing so, he draws the viewer into a changing bath of feelings, he provides for impressive amazement (if he puts a brisk tango on the floor with the beautiful Gabrielle Anwar or can determine her appearance with the scent of a woman), screaming laughter (if he scares poor Chris Oâ€TMDonnell around), tragic moments (if he blows up a family feast or just in the mentioned near suicide scene) and simply enthusiasm (especially with the flaming speech that he brings to the end).
positive;Whoever puts himself in the deep pain of the role of Smith, feels the inner torment of his decisions, which he does not make easy with God.
positive;A scene predictable clichÃ©haft (those in school), nevertheless very exciting implemented.
positive;Sigurd sees evidence of this in the relics of Viking queen Aasa., as well as indications that Ragnarok, the end of the world in the Edda, is based on facts and is not just a myth.
positive;I have to say I went to the cinema with a very bad feeling on Friday.
positive;"In the end you sit completely baffled and with the thought: ""I haven't seen such a brilliant movie for a long time and will not see it so quickly"" in front of the TV, while the credits run over the screen and you slowly come to consciousness : I have a new favorite movie !"
positive;You think it's great?
positive;It deals with our fundamental questions and concerns.
positive;Everything else would be measured!
negative;Definitely not a children's movie.
positive;Confidential deserves a little more attention.
positive;The masks and the make-up are just wonderful and give the movie its own touch.
positive;The Sixth Sense is one of the best movies there is.
positive;In contrast to modern films, they did not replace missing plots but supported the actors.
positive;"Similar to ""Two times Two"", ""Papa ante portas"" or ""Hairspray"" (the original with Devine)."
positive;At the end some question marks remain with the viewer.
positive;The next morning it turns out that Fred killed his wife Renee in a bestial way.
negative;So not Will :-(
positive;Can the extremely subjective feeling of the disgust, of a chess behaviour of the film, be of such great importance for the most objective evaluation of the film?
positive;He's one of the few movies I've seen so many times and still makes me laugh.
positive;He has the dynamics, the look, the action and the characters of a comic book.
negative;Conclusion: Not bad but really can't convince the film.
negative;I've never seen such a boring horror movie before.
positive;"Since Lenny has to use the word ""tail-sucker"" in the public, for example, in court."
negative;Part 2 was also not bad, did not quite as convinced as part 1, but still a good movie.
negative;Everything stays on the track.
positive;Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie knows how to convince completely and the other actors don't fall off too much.The film's strength is the end, which is good for discussions over and over again.
positive;Certainly some hardcore action cinema visitors (ups what a word... grins) might be unheard of, since the action scenes now don't go beyond the film's boundaries.
negative;Just because something is successful, you don't have to do a row.
negative;"Here one is so bent on a great moment of surprise that one deliberately takes the most inconceivable possibility of all and holds it defiantly to the viewer, only to then triumphant â€œYou have not reckoned with it, have you?â€"" to say.[...]"
negative;:-) Technically, there's only the soundtrack to make, which is incredibly loud and extremely intrusive.
negative;There is a Robert De Niro-Themen-Party, together with â€œYou talkinâ€TM to me?â€TM- and â€œFockerâ€'-quotes, in a montage-sequence unscathedly quickly staged away, the trailers take the maybe best gag in advance and anyway the whole thing is only a aimless and connected Kasperletheater, which is perhaps not boring, but the morning after that should be forgotten again.
negative;"The scenes of violence are at best indicated, hardly bloody and shocking; the makers lack the courage (no, the will) to show how children really kill each other."
positive;Some negative recessions almost give the impression that their authors, when watching the film, are so keen on discovering the smallest mistakes that they have given the film no chance to be convinced by his action and staging.
positive;Sidney Lumet's absolute masterpiece!
negative;Just like all the other actors, especially Harrison Ford.
positive;... clearly not my favorite character in the movie but everyone finally has their own opinion.I have to say quite honestly that the 1st part of The Wild Guys I liked better.But the 2nd one was also good.The story is not only about football but also about love and affection.I am already looking forward to the 3rd part.
positive;And that's good!
positive;Hangover is the best comedy I've seen for a long time.
positive;And why isn't Mel Gibson Max?
positive;Successful Stephen King filming with an outstanding Kathy Bates, which was fully rewarded with Oscar and Golden Globe for the role of Annie Wilkes, she plays all facets of the psychopathic personality absolutely credible, without ever slipping into overacting.
positive;and to a film that follows, because he tells many Keline stories next door, which enrich the film instead of taking the necessary space for the two main characters you need.
positive;Convince Spacey, Freeman & Pitt.
negative;With what the plot goes a little fluffy.
negative;"In the hair the expensive wax / the expensive gel, on the body the clothes of well-known designers and a propos ""body"", then the main actor makes himself over in gyms sweating men funny and shows on every occasion his well-chosen body therefore... must come probably from the beer."
positive;At that point, the crew must eventually take the path of the bomb...
positive;I actually liked Nero quite well, but his agenda seemed hairy and then reveals even more plotholes or at least questionable procedures, which make him then unfortunately nevertheless a weak ¶sewicht.
negative;But everyone else convinces in his role.
positive;The Scarface is a masterpiece we know.
negative;"The acting performance is all right, only Ben Affleck unfortunately did not manage to portray ""Batman"" as a superhero."
positive;It's Tarantino.
positive;Just like the acting.
negative;How was this event frighted and how big was the hype !?
negative;In Armageddon you don't get any time at all to realize what is happening, there comes one catastrophe after another, it's not more unrealistic.
positive;This film shines with an equally hard, but successful and exciting story.
negative;Thank you David Yates for the second bad movie.
positive;Otherwise it remains to say: Great film with absolutely realistic, intelligent and highly interesting story.
negative;Well, the music is Abba halt, but everything else that distinguishes a musical film from listening to a CD is possible to bad.
positive;And right here is the point of contention.
positive;Damdamdamdamdamdamdan - Flash - aha...
positive;The story is good, in the end a little confused, but the end is usually the hardest thing about a movie anyway.
negative;Perhaps this film convinces with its charismatic main actor and good acting performances, but for fimply-dumped men like me, who cannot get involved in the romantic mood, the film does not offer any entertainment value, because the plot is, as with most love movies, predictable and the humor is also very fland and offers most of the time an occasional smile.
positive;This movie is absolutely great!
positive;But Tom Hardy (Mad Max) would also have earned him.
positive;A beautiful film with great characters, but they remain somewhat incomprehensible.
positive;"Of course Ryan Gosling does stand out as ""Officer K"", which undergoes such a strong character development as I haven't experienced in the cinema for a long time."
positive;"The fact that the ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" persists in many details in nostalgia is also the reason for the script that again awaits with successful pointed dialogues, but a certain melancholy and the threatening shadow of war cannot and does not want to conceal."
positive;The sex scene between the two main protagonists Tris and Four takes exactly 30 seconds!!!!
positive;"The film becomes particularly bloody by the fact that Tarantino dispenses with modern, digital special effects and uses hand-made effects like in his role models (Japanese combat films from the seventies) â€"" which leads to the fact that when a head or arm is cut off (and that often happens!!!"
positive;It is finally again a movie, which relies on the good old action school, and not so much value on beautiful - but mostly completely unrealistic and thus boring - CGI stunts set!
positive;The plot is clichéd, as are isolated figures.
positive;There was a lot of laughter and my children quickly shut the aliens in their hearts.
positive;But over time the film develops its own character!
positive;"""Skyfall"" does a lot right and dares a lot."
positive;By the way, she also finds the courage to take the slope of her sex to hysteria and drama to the top.
positive;I still like to watch The Omen and The Shining today.
positive;The fight between Hektor and Archillis already mentioned here is also harder and blood flies....In the cinema and on TV, the film is also cut and I would never look at it......Conclusion: A director cut that is really worth it and makes the film better!
positive;Of things that happen daily but are labeled as improbable occurrences.
positive;I'm just wondering how long it took me to find out that the actual opponent of the jury No. 8 (the architect) is not the Grobian No. 3 (the transporter) but his knife-sharply arguing neighbour No. 4 (the broker).
negative;Sometimes you can laugh, but that's what it was.
negative;"I had thought I could laugh here over a Johnny Depp brought to life as a vampire, because everywhere ""comedy"" stands as a genre."
positive;A tragic comedy with depth and ease.
positive;The highlight is of course the end, which for me is one of the best things I know, alone for the end it is a must see.
positive;"However, the film had a few weaknesses: The ""camera man"" filmed in any situation, e.g. (Attention Spoiler!!!!!!!)"
positive;The plot revolves around various trades to come to front places in the draft.
positive;Just the BEST action film of all time.
positive;"When Michael is seriously injured, Selene doesn't complain about the sound situation ""my love"" or something, but only says the bad word with sh in English, but nevertheless (or precisely because of that) this scene is very emotional."
positive;Much has already been written about the hot madness of Kinski and the cold madness of the Duke.
negative;I still know how I walked past the poster with a friend in the cinema, he said â€œI heard it should be good!â€œ and I answered: â€œJo, can be â€œ but he seems to me like a movie that definitely doesn't have much fun!â€œ.
negative;The thinking behind it, which I unfortunately cannot betray from Spoiler-Gründen, was then not even so bad but this kitschy implementation really didn't work at all!
positive;The film is consistently told up to the end and coherent.
positive;So the movie is really cool.
positive;I can only join my previous speaker, I have persuaded my friends to go to the film and none of you have regretted it.
positive;What makes the film are not so much the actors (they contribute a large part) but for me the landscape shots were just as important.
positive;The theme of this film is primarily the re-release of the then American nation (from Spielberg's point of view), which is then placed in relation to the present-day USA.
positive;The actors shine on top level.
positive;That's what it's called, the real Robert Angier must have sacrificed himself...
positive;She's just brilliant in what she's doing.
positive;The movie became outstanding when Bruce Willis came and started singing...
positive;A darker thriller, which calculates with religious delusion and the American vision of a more just world by self-justice, creates it on the first place of the US charts.
positive;But I never read the comics.
positive;Of course, one has noticed that it is not real creations, but it is now mythical creatures and fantasy creatures that do not really exist.
positive;But otherwise still applies: going in, prestige, well-being.
negative;Appreciated, I was strongly recommended, the trailer looks awesome: I had to see this movie.
positive;It is 100% present and this is the biggest advantage of the film.
negative;Unfortunately, it's an absolute mistake about this movie.
positive;It's worth looking at.
negative;The most creepy were the Turks with us in the hall who had to laugh constantly.
positive;All in all, 300 is a really successful action spectacle that can keep the viewer entertained for the full 2 hours!
positive;For me, the truth was, now that I saw him, somewhere in between.
negative;"Only: the rules with which Mr Tarantino breaks are respected for good reason by most filmmakers; if one breaks them, then this should have a good reason, one should be able to offer a better idea."
positive;The film has an outstanding tension.
negative;But it's a turkey cake!
positive;"Instead, the thousandth repetition of ""Fack ju GÃ¶hte"" or such a schmarn like ""The Pute of Panem"" is shown."
positive;Eleanor (Jessica Chastain) would like to disappear, even from life.
positive;I saw this film for the first time at 13 and thought it was a single big comedy at the time: Michael Douglas's actions here are also screaming funny when he orders breakfast with the machine gun FrÃ1⁄4hstück in an imbiÃ ́s, monologues over hamburgers or a screaming neck in his car just hits one.
positive;Still higher out Bond could not.
positive;We watch the paths of the students through the school building and around the school building and always see their back of the head.
negative;The doctor fingers his daughter and loves to do it in between with the village hebamme.
negative;The action scenes are quite well done.
positive;"All in all, ""Disturbia"" is a really successful horror thriller, which finally stands out positively from the typical genre food."
negative;Zb had to kill at least two of the dwarfs.
negative;It all looks great but it also gets boring quickly.
negative;Yes, it is actually the Bösewicht from the first part!
positive;Thank you in advance annett
positive;SPOILER The scene where he says goodbye to his girlfriend by watching her dancing together with the sad backgroundMusic gets under my skin again every time.SPOILER ENDE ICh finds that this film, through its actors, music and effects, brings a mood that somehow inspires anyone who is willing to open up a bit to it.
negative;The second attempt has been better than part 1, but still not a real laugh.
positive;Now the movie is really good.
negative;I could even go on with the magpies like that but that's enough now I think everyone has their own opinion for this movie and can decide for themselves!
positive;The movie is definitely a MUST.
positive;I really loved it because you could never be so sure what happened right now.
negative;In terms of content, the film only transports the fact that life is a pleasure.
negative;Unfortunately, I now believe that the name Nolan was simply used for advertising purposes.
positive;But no one was as good as this.
positive;The bombastic edges fit wonderfully to the many fights and give you just a goose skin feeling!
positive;From the beginning to the credits everything revolves around how to get rid of his opponents with as much explosiveness as possible.
positive;So I find the movie very good, and I've never seen a King Kong movie.
negative;Even the actors, had one not to choose worse and can assign their roles!
positive;in short snow breaks hugo sees the colorful drift in the inside of the train station.
positive;Frankly, the script could have been written by Christian Klar.
positive;All around the Brandner Kasper with Bully in the role as death absolutely convinced us.
positive;I liked the twists.
positive;"You can't get past thinking about the ""time of cannibals"" by Johannes Naber."
negative;Conclusion: No Romeo & Julia post-description, but absurd children's film on the trail of â€œToy Storyâ€ without any significant highlghts
positive;"The people in „€šTransit ""€"" hang firmly in Marseille, they wait for ships, visas, transits."
positive;"Cool was also how the two women (fiona and königin) tried to convince ""their"" men that one could try it and that all their sockes have completed each other."
positive;The BluRay edition includes several short documentaries about characters and film formation, various music videos, trailers and a slightly longer makingOf, which is definitely worth its time.
positive;The Booted Cat has of course become the secret favourite of the spectators, but it is nevertheless distasteful, why one no longer made out of this figure, a certain background story to him would certainly not have harmed.
positive;I can't understand why even Spielberg sees this part as the worst.
negative;"Until then, we're looking at how disguised superheroes jump off the Schuldach, all spontaneously pull out their cell phone and run R.Kelly's ""I Blieve I Can Fly"" somewhere in the background."
positive;Conclusion: La La Land is a real miracle box of fantastic ideas and ideas.
negative;his role doesn't ask him much, yet he does the best out.
positive;This movie is just so great that I went in three times.
positive;"But there is a solution, read through the ""Determinism in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive"" (just afterwards Google)."
positive;The other would be Cate Blanchett!
positive;*ttz* MfG
positive;Less melodic.
positive;But this creates for me the only big weakness of the film: by focusing on so many people you sometimes lose sight of the characters during the editing and you sometimes get the feeling the director B. KormÃ¡kur loses sight of his characters.
positive;In Pulp Fiction he ate his first Big Khauna citizen.
negative;The miscarriages are treated too briefly (described in the book clearly more dramatic) The film itself builds up too little tension, to see the story only from Clair's sight is a bit boring.
positive;One should look at this film, it shows how a normal person can become a murderer and he can't even conclude with his past (after which he killed all men).
positive;Anyone who complains that Michael Moore is researching too superficially, probably did not understand what Moore is all about.
positive;The film is really very well done from the technical details, from the special effects etc. Robert Downey Jr.
positive;In my opinion, you have to see the movie like the trailer.
positive;P.S.Saw1 is very good but stylish in another class.
positive;For example, I love to think about what an alternative film end could look like.
positive;However, I was not exposed.
positive;This is mainly thanks to Marc Forster's brilliant directional work.
positive;During the World Cup you have seen everything from the outside (TV/PublicViewing), you were one of many.
positive;The story itself is fresh and just as natural represented.
positive;The German characters often seem more intelligent than those of the Allies.
positive;Rather because you don't get around the comparison.
positive;The film is not like otherwise on mega complicated opaque plot but rather lies on the small details and has e.g. Scenes in it which are labeled in Hollywood as unnecessarily, but simply entertained and above all more to the characters and the fictional world, as in older films.
positive;Juno is neither a film pos and thus a classic Oscar candidate nor an abortion debate film - I think this has to be internalized in spite of all the advance laurels.
positive;But instead only about the murders here also a little about the life is discussed and the different perspectives represented.
negative;Caine is absolutely outstanding, you just want to share your company with a glass of whiskey.
positive;To laugh sick but no clamot - just Suuuuper!!
positive;Absolutely recommended!
positive;I watched the film at home alone and was very happy about it, because I cried uninhibitedly.
positive;Sometimes you get the feeling that you're watching a documentary that's really exciting.
positive;Have fun!
positive;In any case, he stimulates to think about what is immensely beautiful.
positive;Guys, we got 2012.
positive;The malice, which so terrified Simmons, as also convincingly engulfed me truly seized me.
negative;For an entertaining, sometimes funny film evening the loft is enough so easy.
positive;Neither of them can win the sympathy of the audience, with Nixon clear thing, with Frost a really good elaboration of the character.
positive;The facial expressions, the appearance and the charisma convince up to the last minute of the film.
positive;As bonus material the DVD â€žUnused scenesâ€œ, interviews with the director and the leading actor as well as a slide show are included.
positive;Asks only if you experience in the already announced second part what is with the chicken.
negative;Until the first characters died, I was very bored and often thought about whether to go home, but I still had hope.
positive;Have fun!
negative;It is so no place for humor at all and somehow everything seems too much wanted, too very staged and just overstated... 1.5 stars I give for the good special effects and the otherwise naturally undeniable good style of the film.
positive;Arnie was even a little more human.
positive;Maybe Spielberg lacked the direct connection to the material?
positive;Big movie theater.
negative;a bad movie with bad adaptations of some marches.
positive;The highlight are the outtakes at the end of the film!
positive;He tells how a wealthy boy, who lacked nothing, loses his parents on the street.
positive;I looked at him two days later.
negative;"Due to the guest appearances the film seems rather cheap and one had dug out some ""B"" celebrities from the sinking."
positive;Elvis & Nixon by Liza Johnson is a wonderful little film that shows both the entertainer legend Elvis Presley and the unsympaths of the service Richard Nixon from a surprising side.
negative;That's what it's called, one of the reasons why the trailer didn't spoil a good deal might consist of simply nothing to spoil: a small (largely played) girl lands with a giant and his fantasy world and simply spends time with him â€ , the end.
positive;See you soon ... ... your Movie Magger!
positive;This is really good entertainment and thanks Spielberg that there is this really entertaining series !!!
positive;He does not pay attention to empathy or physical health.
positive;9/10
negative;What's that supposed to be Crank cool new innovative fast to track plot is part 2 of any wanted artistsArtQuatchActionfilm of the psychedelic drug types might like.
positive;I just love these new Batman movies!
negative;Unfortunately, you look too often the CGI out, especially in a scene, and that doesn't look good.
positive;I myself had to look at it several times to understand it, but I liked it from the beginning.
positive;:-)
positive;A perfectly made women's film with excellent actresses and time levels.
positive;The desert of Nevada, with great atmospheric images, covered with great music, is the scene of an authentic story that picks up, accompanies the viewer early and offers something unusual for the genre.
positive;Tim helps, among other things, artist Harry (Tom Hollander) and in particular his overemotional, constantly stuck in trouble sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson, â€žEverything we had to giveâ€œ).
negative;No really good introductions, tight but 08/15-mÃ1⁄4ige staging and decent actors!
positive;TIP:You should try to be careful.
positive;Of course, the technique is the outstanding element at Cameron's work.
positive;The script is simply great !!
negative;The movie would have been so much more!
positive;Ingrid Bergman, must be completely innocent, while Sean Connery throws his hat into the ring.
positive;Russell Crowe denies the former chemist of a tobacco company Jeffrey Wigand, whose life continues to go down due to the statement against the corporations.
positive;"What remains is the realization that one should not trust so blindly on reviews and that one as a long-time film fan is nevertheless more used to the brutality degree than that ""Requiem for a dream"" could shock."
negative;Magic Azubi with the charm of a tablet of Valium (äh ... yes, Harry Potter) pull the cursor.
positive;In her boundless screams she sparks an almost painful intensity.
negative;It remains, however, more or less, exciting until the end, because you don't know what you actually expect or what the murder at the beginning should actually be.
positive;He delivers Seth Gecko with an ultimate coolness, and it makes fun to watch him.
negative;These little details are totally missing from the movie.
positive;Satisfaction runs out of radio on the boat and Clean dances to it.
positive;Arriving in the dungeon, Aladdin meets an old man who tells him of a wondrous hÃ¶hle with many treasures.
positive;All the characters/actors are back on board and you get a familiar feeling.
negative;Well, anyway... then the scene with the police station came and a black miniskirt said I knew: Yes!
positive;The final result is always rounded.
positive;In the end, however, this is a matter of taste.
positive;It's a pity that this film is partially denounced in reviews.
positive;The liberation can be felt for the first time, with which this film was played and produced.
positive;But you also have to say that you have to slowly get scared after hostel and this movie in the east to spend your holiday.
positive;The simple medium and the gesture-rich language can only love in Moroccan.
positive;This movie was completely fine.
positive;He has the strength of his people without its weakness.
positive;In my opinion, it's a great movie.
positive;Otherwise, there's nothing to see.
positive;Where E.T.
negative;From the beginning of the film to the end I have taken away from him the encapsulation of the small foreigner in wholes.
positive;RamÃ3n Sampedro is supported by his family and friends.
positive;The boy who represented 'Danny didn't even know where he was involved.
positive;At the beginning of the 1980s: Elio (ThimotÃ©e Chalamet) is the 17-year-old son of an archaeology professor (Michael Suhlbarg), passionately plays piano and speaks several languages.
positive;But which one is it?
positive;Soundtrack bombastic.
positive;The one who constantly leads the unscrupulousness of an industry at the expense of the poor population in front of one's eyes.
negative;Highlight in the cast and also acting is undoubtedly Sir Ian McKellen.
positive;You just don't take it from the characters when they get back into any theories, but you just accept them.
negative;More humor, more charm, quiet camera, future, comprehensible told story, and like technical gimicks and beautiful women.
positive;"The self-irony of the ""Oldies"" (please excuse this word, I myself am over 60..) is brilliant.With the scene Til Schweiger in front of a white sheet of paper, screenwriter and director have surpassed each other."
positive;Real lifelike animation, super work
positive;Nevertheless dissuasive.Full clear: 10 points!
positive;[... DAWN OF THE DEAD meets MAD MAX.
positive;Now already one of my favorite movies ever!
positive;The beige score does its rest and gives the tension an additional wurtz.
positive;Something like that should be seen again in today's blockbusters.
negative;My children and I were disfellowshipped.
positive;In this case, at any rate, a film worth seeing that does not get boring even after the first run.
negative;So what does the man want to tell us?
positive;In the end, therefore, a warm, meandered chronicle of the events in the time lapse, a cuddly best-of of the worst actions.
positive;Sucker Punch is a great movie.Apart from the wonderful pictures and the fabulous action scenes, which you certainly haven't seen yet (where you've seen a dragon chasing an airplane) , the soundtrack has convinced me in particular.I've never heard such unusual pieces in a movie before.Besides Björk and a cover piece of the Beatles, a number of great pieces have appeared in this film as cover versions, which you certainly haven't heard in this form yet.Who criticizes the story is flat, he simply didn't understand away the great statement of the film.Even the scenes, which are often too obscene and too perfidiously criticized, cannot be traced to perfection.Nately, many things are portrayed as exaggerated and exuberant, but certainly not because it lacks a fine feeling, but only to illustrate the statement and to keep the society alive.
positive;Hope your film selection at the previews remains so good!
positive;"In the beginning very funny, not exactly demanding and suddenly this turn into dramatic... and at the end then the ""Pointe""!"
positive;My compliments to the actors, the director and the scriptwriters.
positive;There are many reasons to say that this film is a true masterpiece.
positive;Great and funny movie...with a very entertaining soundtrack.
positive;So no Hollywood movie.
positive;The movie's just so exciting.
positive;it is a true Höllentripp on life and death, to which the u-boat crew of u-96 on their enemy journey is exposed daily captain heinrich lehman, by his men respectfully called the old, and his occupation are mercilessly chased by destroyers and bombarded aircrafts. the fate and the enemy know no mercy
positive;The animations are perfect and the characters well worked out.
positive;"For sure, ""Claudy with a chance of meatballs"" is not a very demanding entertainment, but the effective, intuitive book filming is a detachable spectacle full of life and joy in details and outstanding ideas.Although the film is extremely silly and sometimes much too coppery from the ideas, but this film simply makes fun and is very worth seeing for any animation fan.Whether spaghetti tornado, steak rain or Eiffel Tower sandwich, action and entertainment are always in and in Real-D this movie is very emphelen."
positive;"next to ""out for justice, nico, hard to kill"" and ""under Siege"" probably the best seagal film ... everything after ""on deadly ground"" was more or less cheap ..."
negative;The movie is coming to you?
negative;The story is strange, the acting performance underground and the effects in the movie you notice the computer descent.
negative;Who is aware of this and has already seen the one or other report via television, Internet etc..
positive;I don't need to talk about the occupation at all, it's better than that.
negative;Although the most extreme violence is indicated there, it is not really shown.
negative;Only actresses and if men appear there, they are shown as blöde.
positive;the film is the most amusing and nasty family reunion for a long time
positive;This film not only offers a lot of beautiful pictures accompanied with solos of two world famous strings, it also shows a very emotional side.
positive;Cinema in the 21st century.
positive;Nevertheless, it remains to be hoped that the strip develops into a small classic â€¦ Conclusion: Nice, small action number, late and enjoyable!
positive;the two harmonize wonderfully with each other.
positive;"Against the outside, the dystopian blood fable ""Battle Royale"" may present itself as a brutal, in some places strongly overdrawn parabola on forgotten war dreams, but at the core Fukasaku also understands how to address existential questions and provide answers or counter-questions in a straightforward manner."
negative;Also in this finale there is a big logic error.
positive;Who Larson really steals the show is the eight-year-old Jacob Tremblay, who delivers one of the probably most authentic young actor performances I have ever seen.
positive;This movie is just great!!!
positive;Due to the rather bad recessions, I went to the cinema with quite uncertainty, although I was looking forward to this movie.
positive;There is the great tension that Israeli society is facing without creating or moralizing it.
positive;I had to think about my own life...
positive;Continued.
negative;my advice: rather look at 28 days later again and don't let yourself be deterred by the worse valuation...
positive;What I really liked about the script (and where the movie definitely moved away from the standard films) was the focus of the story, because it really rested for 118 minutes only on our main characters.
negative;The supporting actors, also to mention Josh Brolin are neither negative nor positive.
positive;He wants him, he wants Kal-El aka Clark Kent and threatens to destroy the Earth if he doesn't turn himself in within 24 hours.
positive;You don't have to travel back in time, just to make your life better in a second attempt, because the real art of life is to live every day as if it were the last and best.
negative;In addition, the story is still interesting, but I don't find it deep-rooted enough and very drawn into the length.
positive;About Ti1t: I respect your opinion, but I'm asking you a question: Have you ever bought, assembled, installed, and run something, e.g. a computer, in Saturn?
positive;Curse of the Caribbean, part 1 and also 2 are simply the best movies at all.In fact, in part 1 the story is more compressed and final...Part 2 is just not so, since it is only half the story and part 3 the sequel.Part 2 is especially interesting, since many small details are hidden, which you don't notice the first time you watch.Also Johnny Depp continues to play convincingly and well.I am looking forward to the 3.
negative;But the film was so flat that we allowed the book more depth afterwards than we had until then.
negative;But let's face it, a lot of handmade action, paired with a bit of modernity (as in the 2nd century).
positive;For all fantsyfans I recommend this movie but the rest does not necessarily have to see this good movie.
positive;"""Spotlight"" is about a team of journalists wanting to expose the abuse in the Catholic Churches!"
negative;Thank God I wasn't in the movies and did this movie to myself.
positive;Acting, it is a very good performance by the actors, factually correct and not exaggerated.
positive;To speak once again on the topic overlaid: Shoot em up is HEMMUNGSLOS overlaid.
positive;He had a great time watching this movie.
positive;In a world that breaks so much apart, it seems to me that I want to keep them together a little bit, not to be so bad ( Desmond Doss Ein must be for every movie.
positive;==References==
positive;"What made me think about the film's history, however, was that the film „€"" was mostly drawn towards the end â€"" and then the end was dealt with in three places and came very abruptly."
positive;The two fall in love with each other although the girl is already promised.
positive;Respect.
positive;Because this film has sense, humor, logic and above all creativity.
positive;I was completely banished and this feeling of being stuck in a situation and not coming out, I could feel well.
positive;there are many scenes that are different and funny despite the well-known clichés.
positive;The story 2.The atmosphere 3.
negative;Wonderfully made this movie, but must one therefore ignore these extremely obvious logic mistakes?
positive;That's how movies should be!
negative;The first part of Crank belongs to the top 10 of my favorite movies!
negative;As the attack of this SS company on the tank is also depicted militarily (the shooting booth is quite good), is a bad joke and then only the tip of the iceberg.
negative;If that's not creepy, then what?
positive;Come also what really interested, the actors are very suitable for such a movie, the score skin of a several times the gänsehaut several times through the whole body and at the end Billy Boyd with last Goodbye, it is not better.
positive;But also for Sophie this story writes a few new lines of her life.
positive;Probably the most authentic and credible horror movie ever.
negative;the film is simply stupid and does not build anathmosphere.
positive;This isn't just another 0815 zombie movie.
negative;At the end, a handsome work that hits optically in the dark remains.
positive;particularly with regard to the architect.
positive;It would open up a new dimension!
positive;that he thought he was part 1 was clear, because it was all about a treasure hunt!What did you expect then?!?
negative;Snail-like and without heights and depths the speakers would be through the story.
negative;Conclusion: Electrifying main character and an incredible shy scenario towards the end.
positive;the film has surpassed my expectations by far (I had a very large expectation as I am a big fan) match point is a big cinema, a drama that shows us the possibilities of the film.
negative;After arriving with the ship in an unsurprising city, the Samburu warrior Lemalian (Jaky Ido) meets them again and again and helps them out of the mess.
positive;I have not read the book but the opinion one could have made a two or three parts from it.
negative;As already said, from the Synchro I was silent, a JJ delivery was probably so thin that it was necessary to make the sound louder.
negative;This is about death.
positive;A TV series will not bring the desired success.
positive;A clear recommendation for all friends of the somewhat more profound horror of me.
positive;And one more word to all English teachers: To treat the book in class, so to read and watch the film next to it for a better understanding, I and some other students of the 11th class liked very much.
positive;The scenes in the tunnel, or those with the F35, were already more than well staged.
positive;about what it goes on in rough tongues you can read in the FS-review.
positive;The Lord of the Rings - For me, those who are in danger are the best part of the Middle Earth Saga.
negative;"The reactions in the cinema were a colorful mixture of: ""What a Sch****"" or ""pffft... such a scrap"" or ""What a waste of time"" up to ""We'd rather have seen something else""."
positive;Birdman must have been seen once.
positive;Thanks again to you great master Quentin Tarantino but also director Tony Scott.
negative;In addition, there is also a very dreary behavior of the figures.
negative;...and tragically, the only good thing about this movie is Depp.
positive;If you're looking for blood, you won't be happy with this movie.
negative;What would have looked like the plan if a former director had concentrated more on his actors, instead of stamping out from a twenty-page booklet an uplifted script with 300 pages and without real historical substance.
positive;Shyamalan, probably rarely before the name of a filmmaker has the viewers so much insecure what comes for a film on you?
positive;Also it becomes clear to my opinion that the people not only have to fight in the trench but also with themselves to escape their desires from the war, to consider the uncertainty about the family and the conflict Lans people of his own family as fine and to fight.
positive;"Y tu mama tambien, in Germany but also known as ""...with your mother too!"""
positive;I was very surprised that you heard so little of wolf children up to this movie, they actually existed.
positive;However, this (like to sound stupid) is naughty violence.
positive;I can only follow my previous speakers and describe this film in three words: moving - picking up - terrible!
negative;So am I.
positive;Lovett creates a common future.
positive;He manages to show without highlighted index fingers that no citizen should go to war for whatever reason.
negative;Hugh Jackman is quite good at the role of Wolverine, but this character demands from Jackman a persistently painful and strained-nerved facial expression, animal-like shell actions with tried but failed coolness and strikingly-crushing broken & broken-type attitude.
positive;9/10 points from me, however, would have liked to have been explained by one why the conclusion was so inexplicable...
positive;Seven lives on the tension, the bodies and above all on the partly shocking sets.
negative;This, as expected, but consistently drawn through end, deserves praise as well.
negative;The fight between Bane and Batman was too obvious and for a â€œGrande Finaleâ€ much too â€œ normalâ€ , absolutely nothing that remains in memory.
negative;A typical Bay movie.
positive;I can keep looking at myself.
positive;Perhaps in general once with the fact that the film wonderfully shows why for humans earlier (more than today) faith was so important.
negative;Russell Crowe remains pale, Mark Strong is absolutely nothing as a villain, Oscar Isaac has too little screen time to bring his villains much over and Max of Sydow does his best.
positive;Maybe there is still hope for the blockbuster cinema, after the film kill of the last months (Shrek3, 300, Transformers etc.) comes now an intelligent, craft perfect film.
positive;[...
positive;Next week still in English and then hopefully with a long version on Bluray.
positive;I've never seen such a horny movie!
positive;I repeat myself, but WHEN A SCHOCKER FILM WILL----SAW!
positive;I watched this movie with a girlfriend, and I have to say I loved it.
negative;Although I'm a huge independent movie fan.
positive;LG Helga W. ðŸ ‹
positive;Director: Bryan Singer Year: 2015 Label: 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Length: 144 min (Cinema version: 132 min) FSK: from 12 years
positive;In part very funny and entertaining, but also serious and emotional.
positive;Don't go over it.
positive;She would like a sign of him, language that she understands and can accept, with one word: recognition.
positive;The results are charming, creative films that appeal to both religious and secondary audiences.
positive;Super Charactere, ingenious script, my tip: Don't listen to the cracks - SEE and make your own opinion!
positive;That's great!
negative;Only unfortunately it stops there already.
positive;At least in the first part he does not live up to his reputation (he has a maximum of 2 faces) .
positive;Not every Afghan is represented as a boss.
positive;The undoubtedly best and most exciting, but at no moment kitschy scene is Joe's appearance in the witness stand.
negative;The end is predictable, but not bad, even though I can't understand the police officer's action!
positive;The actors do their part well, action is there, tension - paired with two or three shock moments - likewise.
positive;The film definitely offers surprising scenes that you just don't expect.
positive;Here, the camera is also intimidated by executions during the beating of the death strip, one of the few violent scenes in an otherwise rather unbrutal film.
negative;In the overall ranking, however, I tell you, I would never see this movie again, never spend any more money for it, I would like to forget it, so boring he was partly.
positive;Ultimately, he threatens to break apart and every spectator would understand if he would just throw away the sticks and never come back again.
positive;The film is absolutely worth seeing and Jeff Bridges the Oscarfavorit par excellence.
negative;As I said before, I like Terminator 3 as a standalone action film.
positive;Also you have to say that Musil and performers are very suitable!
positive;Unbelievable what the little QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis delivers here for an acting performance.
positive;His name is Dalton.
positive;Something that's there, even if you can't touch it or understand it.
positive;Born in Vienna in 1759, the daughter of a court official is a talented pianist and is raised with rigour.
negative;Because it's still the same and the NERVT.
positive;I also liked the story and was very exciting but also humorous.
positive;In the course of the film, the viewer also experiences the story of the murdered girl, including flashbacks, so that she does not remain an unknown victim, but gets emotional relevance in history.
positive;So the character writing was really great and pulled me completely into the movie.
negative;Where are the teens exposed as next?!
positive;"In the pianist he was wonderful, fantastic in The Village, and he is now the only man all over the world I would call ""the man""."
negative;I think there would be few actors who would be able to do that.
positive;For all those who want to see an exciting movie, an absolute must.
positive;Masterpiece.
positive;His laughflash is already legendary.
negative;For children in any case a hit and a few chucklers for the rest of the goods definitely in it.
positive;The film is really only intended for thinkers.
positive;So it would be possible for everyone to find the answer themselves.
negative;It's all set up and without real emotions.
positive;The film is not at the beginning like the original with a lengthy introduction or prehistory (which would only bore the zombie friend anyway), but one is already after a few minutes in the middle of the slaughter.
negative;"This film is also reminiscent of ""Total Recall"", but you don't always feel like it, because you can guess a lot."
positive;How do I find my place, even though everyone else is doing such great things?
negative;be transferred to obtain some of its solidity.
negative;In fact, no one is afraid of that!
positive;These differences between both worlds and the faith of his two fathers are beautifully highlighted.
positive;And a very nice camera with high-quality cameras I think it's hard to find in a poor slum!
positive;Of course, a lot of action dominates this movie, but in contrast to Hollywood action film, this is not about stupid fiction, but about naked facts.
positive;The horror of reality begins slowly, then more and more to act.
negative;The film can never make up its mind.
positive;Also the German dubbing in matters Darth Vader is really ridiculous...
positive;The figure of Yuri Orlov is too cold, too smooth.
negative;The film did not scare me particularly, nor was much to be felt from the psychological depth.
positive;Unfortunately, it was to be expected that many people will be targeting less the crucial subtext, but rather the immeasurable presentation of violence with pleasure.
negative;Although some are very funny places, but the story is so unfaithful that in my opinion it messes up the whole movie.
positive;I found great, a super nice round comedy to laugh and cry.
positive;If you just want to laugh heartily, this film is highly recommended.
positive;Stupid, funny and yet with remarkable depth and special charm.
negative;But it was nothing.
positive;This changing bath of feelings with Gretel and with all the other participants, of helpless, desperate, powerless, sad, but also cheerful and sometimes even cheerful - all this is well familiar to me.
positive;Saw4 will be the high point!!!!
negative;Overall, a low-budget movie that is not worth watching.
negative;Maybe the movie had some good moments.
negative;A well-intentioned film, which ultimately only becomes a test of patience for the viewer.
positive;"The probably best action scene in which you could admire Lord Vader so far, however, spares the viewer just as the literally seamless transition to ""A New Hope""."
positive;Absolutely recommended!
negative;It is depicted without mockery and shame: Dylan is seen singing of the kingdom of God, preaching of redemption.
positive;He created several poetic - silent moments and an ingenious end, which would lead even the most profuse viewers.
negative;"In no case is ""self-conversations"" a mandatory film, in any case it is a film whose fun factor increases exponentially with the number of friends present."
positive;The story seems to be a little new at first, but you quickly realize that it is developing in a direction that offers a lot of drama and tension.
positive;==References====External links==* Official website
positive;The movie's really top!
positive;Downey Jr.
positive;One does not necessarily have to stand on the motorcycle driving to like this movie.
negative;This would be the material for large cinema, but unfortunately the film drowns in melodramatic strings.
positive;Morbid, atmospheric, dirty and incredibly exciting.
negative;Otherwise, many topics are addressed, but are not played out.
negative;You tried to pack this movie with lots of stuff.
positive;The film shows how Lara Croft first becomes Tomb Raider, she is vulnerable and authentic.
positive;Me and my girlfriend were almost the only ones, except for another couple.
positive;Until it turns out that his own son, Tony, fell in love with the girl.
positive;Maybe that's why I'm cartooning with Tsubasa, Tom & Jerry and Bugs Bunny Association.
positive;SPECIALLY NOTHING!!!
positive;If you didn't see this strip, you really missed something!
positive;partly very emotional, but also very amüssant.
positive;Not a second boredom comes up, everything just fits like the apple on I. Eddie Murphy great.
positive;Of course Riccardo Pizzuti must be mentioned.
positive;"After Lord of the Rings I always wanted to call out: ""Give me a sword!"""
negative;But also his role is quite overreacting.
positive;After Bill opened himself to the gathered party participants, some people have to rethink.
negative;At every corner a child is fucked, at night you can not sleep and constantly and everywhere is shot for no reason.
negative;From my circle of friends I often heard the same opinion.
positive;I went into the film with down-screwed expectations, due to the necessary press echo in advance, and was positively surprised.
positive;To help others, if it was also deadly, exemplary for all of us.
positive;So when I saw the film the first time in television I got really emotional^^^ the film is really great.
positive;"Everybody should know the name ""Steve Jobs"" these days."
negative;The dialogues & actions of the actors are simply stupid and annoying.
positive;Jack Black!)
positive;on the curse everything has belonged to large cinema: exciting story, good actors, interesting turns, explosions may also not be missing.
negative;And beyond that even in the later course of the films and series actually were exchanged ... this already testifies that these characters are simply not really important and can not really captivate a spectator ... with which already the whole adventures can not really function and build up keiennlichen tension ...
negative;The love story is beautiful and very romantic, but you are somehow left in the air as a spectator.
positive;If you decide to watch the film, you would definitely be advised to do this on the big screen, that looks really great.
positive;Stallone plays as always the word-carrying single fighter, he does not allow any emotions.
negative;Right loosely based on the 2003 published 272 pager â€ž21â€œ.
positive;The film is one of the most beautiful animal films I've seen in the last few years.
positive;Geishas are not prostitutes, but disciplined women who understand their artistic arts...
negative;"But a little more depth would have done the film well, perhaps even a little more serious in the sense that real ""embassies"" are conveyed, as e.g. at ""€žBig Fish"" a little more insidious and honest."
positive;Conclusion: Here and there already a bit dusty, it is however with beautiful shearing a classic that should be looked at at every Christmas time.
positive;A wonderful love movie, I haven't cried like that for a long time.
positive;"The ""unspoken"" that he conveys with his gestures and facial expressions is more valuable than any word."
negative;The film is far too short, you have had the feeling that the film itself is in a hurry to get ready quickly.
negative;There are no authorities monitoring a private bank or central bank.
positive;I think you can let children from the age of 8 go into this movie without hesitation.
negative;With great expectations I have now looked at the new Grindhouse/Splatter effusion from Mr. Rodriguez, and was again bitterly exposed as with Planet Terror or Death Proof.
positive;This is only referred to on the workplace of Bethany - an abortion clinic (well noted as a Catholic).
positive;A milestone in film history!
positive;Part 3 was a wonderful conclusion of the series.
positive;A very big praise to the refimation of Batman.
positive;Full 5 stars
positive;The power of cinema is projected here perfectly on the screen.
positive;__________________ The movie has become really brilliant.
negative;This story is nothing more than a fairy tale.
negative;But at least in Amir's case it's a wish-marriage, very progressive!
positive;==References==
positive;The book was great, but the movie was a disaster.
positive;This movie just makes everything more exciting.
positive;Also thanks to your crew incl.
positive;Especially for car fans the spectacular bus scenes are interesting.
positive;How one stands after more than 20 years to the effects, everyone may decide for itself.
positive;This strong ensemble brings about a sad film full of tender, quiet humor and calm atmosphere that moves and inspires.
positive;For the fact that it is a newly conceived story, the script is really coherent and suggests a good tension arc.
positive;"However, it is to say that this is no longer a ""child film"" in the sense."
positive;Other figures get wind of the matter too.
positive;The daring maneuver to save the planet, over its surface on a platform for miles, is spectacularly staged and in turn trickfully brilliant.
positive;So the script for the first episode is simply suddenly there, the multi-faceted creatures are not first invented, but appear ready on the set and why the Tardis actually inside is bigger than outside hardly anyone questions.
positive;----------------------------------------------------------------- complete review see:
positive;"Steve McQueen delivers his next very good work after his great movies ""Hunger"" and ""Shame""!"
negative;"The action of the film is limited to ""make a little noise and scare up the chickens""; so in some ways the protagonists grasp it in words."
negative;28 days later, I thought it was awesome.
positive;No, from time to time you should also think about what you are looking at and that's what the film has achieved.
positive;He is always absolutely convincing Derek Vinyard as an intelligent villain, just as brutal as neo-Nazi bragged by rhetorical finesse and loud, responsible big brother.
positive;First of all you get a funny action scene with Spidey.
positive;Absolutely memorable scenes took place on the train, where Paul Newman outsmarted the gangster boss while playing cards, I found it awesome.
positive;Because here is the focus of tragic irony.
positive;But when one day a man named Marenglen appears, and StavrosÂ ́ aged and denied mother believes in him to recognize her long lost son, the chaos is perfectâ€¦ A small, but quite fine comedy.
positive;"Who, for example, has ever seen the ""Taxi"" movies or ""The fifth element"" knows somewhere what awaits him, or!?"
negative;The film is carried solely by the acting.
positive;Okay, the naive Naomi Watts was really highly naive...but well, who is expecting the super-bÃ¶sewicht even behind the nice plot of Moller-Stahl?
negative;They're still so innocent!
negative;The characters act very superficially, the story is to dünn and tension is further not present.
negative;"Jack Nicholson as a psychopath is naturally in his ""standard role"" also not bad."
negative;However, the political situation has been drastically aggravated by the Greek state debt and the resolutions of Edward Snowden.
positive;Very refreshing also the presentation of the new Bondgirl LÃ©a Sedoux.
positive;The effects here are naturally again the upper hammer, par excellence, so finely detailed, so enormous, simply so incomprehensible â€¢ however, it has to be said here that this year the film has really incredibly strong competition with Guardians Of The Galaxy or Godzilla.
positive;To criticism of the right of care and association What should the fathers and children still be able to align, if you have the women's houses, juveniles and courts against yourself!
negative;Part of it will come here despite my darkness.
positive;I can watch the movie over and over again and I still find it all the same!
positive;Nevertheless, even if it is overdrawn, some scenes are simply warm and beautiful, for example if a strict husband at once proves to be hearty and invites his service girl to eat.
positive;Finally a movie where a planetarium occurs and jazz.
positive;In addition, this film was the foundation stone for many more films.
positive;I don't really buy the American safe world 08/15 family from the governor.
positive;"Honestly, the very first time I've been in the movies, I was pretty tired of the nerves when Ennis gets the postcard with the evil word ""DECREASED""."
positive;The 3D effect does not offer a visual spectacle Ã¡ la â€žAvatarâ€œ, but still shows unusually clear, sharp images and is therefore to be emphasized positively.
positive;The depths allow more distant things to appear slightly blurred, the background with mortuary mountains, narrow rooms and gardens in the darker grey.
positive;Not the very well-founded rider, but can still inspire.
positive;Who wants to see a super exciting, action-rich and humorous movie should go inside!!!
positive;Well it is very long, but to tell the story the time is also useful.
positive;Since the film is 1968, I had my doubts as to whether I would be able to cope with the monkey masks or whether I had to laugh about it.
negative;Certainly the action is in the first place and it was also well staged.
positive;They're taken off their roles, they seem to have had a good time, and I immediately found them nice.
positive;had seen the film in Bochum at the NRW premiere.
positive;That would build up the same stress for another Ivan and mean the end of the movie.
positive;If you look closely you can see a few plates, e.g. the young Sean Astin alias Sam from the â€žLord of the Ringsâ€œ films or Joe Pantoliano from â€žMatrixâ€œ and â€žBad Boysâ€œ.
positive;just great.
negative;"Years ago I had read the book ""The Hundred Years..."" and was thrilled, the resulting film was already less fascinating."
positive;I think film is incredibly good.
positive;Of course, the film runs in 3D.
negative;Worst movie I've ever seen.
positive;Anyone who has experienced how Indian riders handle their bikes, what, where and why is grown and who has seen the modifications and modifications to my father's motor wheels will see the film with different eyes.
positive;A super movie !!!!
positive;These are both quite justified points of criticism.
positive;), however, in my eyes the perfect conclusion for this movie offers.
positive;Who likes zombie movies, should watch the one who can't do anything with it anyway should let it stay!!!
positive;Especially joy comes from the hand-made, tough fight scenes.
negative;I'd have wanted an end, which would clear up more.
negative;The film not only raises questions and problems - it also answers them: With a two-hour omnipotence and revenge fantasies as an all-round solution.
positive;Rating: 4 out of 5 points.
positive;"My absolute favorite ""Mad Max""."
positive;"Right in advance; who visits the film with the claim to realism and complex plots which will be bitterly disheartened."
positive;The black Nazi is an excellent grotesque, which plays wonderfully with racist prejudices and slogans, but also general clichés about neo-Nazis.
negative;The movie had hardly shock moments and was brutally true he also not really is probably something for the horror beginners.
negative;What was only annoying after some time in the course of the film were the clumsy slapstick attempts to create laughs by dancing H. Grant, cutting grimaces and singing.
negative;Evil and good deliver themselves there an eternal battle.
positive;One of the best movies in the world with great talks, quotes, an ingenious soundtrack, an ingenious cast and a masterful director !
positive;Nevertheless, this film really has depth.
positive;Until then Reeves has a lot of things to tell.
positive;Unfortunately, the director saved on that.
positive;A further attraction of the action is the permanent change of the fronts, with which suddenly also the sexes resist.
negative;I liked his performance as an arrogant doctor, who is absolutely hairy on his title.
negative;"Maybe you took a look back at the drawings of ""Manhatten"" in the original comic, which can be considered the only excuse for this."
positive;These are mostly bloody inserts.
positive;I felt a little sorry for the sign card or what it was.
positive;Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz, Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly play their soul out of their bodies with pleasure and the audience can laugh at each other.
negative;David, Russell, Judy and her assistant manage to escape.
positive;This is real cinema.
positive;Muldoon open for the first time.
negative;Actor fade, dialogues mau.
positive;"Why is Vaiana's father referred to as ""Chief"" when the correct translation of the word village chief would simply be ""Chief""?"
positive;That the film with this story can not be physically accurate can make sense to everyone.
positive;For example, the thing that Jack never laughs again since Ennis rejects him after the divorce.
negative;In New York, Franky (now he calls himself Roy) tries to negotiate a deal with Mafia boss Billy Burke.
positive;It's a simple story that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote together.
positive;The authenticity of her and the other emerging characters and the truthful and dramatic depth of the story make film worth seeing.
positive;Very good!
positive;no absurdities brought about on the hair, but a logically constructed, well-founded explanation models, quite stringent and legible on 18 pages summarized.
positive;I have to say, since Master and Commander, I haven't seen such an exciting adventure film.
positive;"The scene in which he takes the ""whole booth"" apart and the Stormtrooper then makes the bend very quickly is so funny."
positive;The movie really scared the both of us.
positive;Thursday evening it was finally for me so far.
negative;There are also positive moments, no question, that unfortunately the negative aspects can not trump over.
positive;The two longer discussions with Seymour Hoffman are as exciting as an elaborate action insert, because its game is no less minutely performed in every movement.
positive;Juvenile-favoring, despotism simply only ill Gewalexess follows on violence excess.
positive;Steven Spielberg created here a tragic and rousing drama, which brings to heart deeply.
negative;The movie had bad plots.
positive;He never had to stand straight for his grievances.
negative;All HP books that existed at that time, read.
negative;These are pretty much the most dramatic scenes in the whole movie.
positive;Money is kind of time when rich people can afford any medication and some poor devil fights to survive naked....
positive;What a sensational trick, in which one sees in a bizarre way an autobiograhpic Crux, as hard as it may have appeared in advance to want to surpass the probably most iconic villains of all time.
positive;"There the food for the doors is prepared next to the cuddling; the lady in the kitchen occasionally looks unrepentant."
positive;All I can say is that it's a good movie for a nice movie night and can definitely offer entertainment.
positive;It is determined to finally solve itself of the â€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€â€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€
positive;Wonderful animation film for a long time!
positive;Above all, it offers a great Viggo Mortensen.
positive;Conclusion: One of the best German films I've ever seen!
positive;:-)
negative;"Overall, the film is not bad but just because of the length, the lack of creativity and the unbalanced style of Scott is ""Man under fire"" highest medium!"
negative;"The shooting of the little dog, on the other hand, was given as an overwhelming and cruel detail, so that the last one in the head also had that Hitler was ""bÃ¶se""."
positive;Pure excitement, a portion of action, joke and sometimes a bit of depth make this movie the absolute must of every Harry Potter fan (and also of every other movie lover).
positive;Without wanting to betray more: The end is definitely a surprise and stands in stark contrast to the rest of the film.
positive;A brilliant acting achievement of all participants.
positive;"So Up is in my view ""only"" a very good movie, instead of being a superior one."
positive;Even if the sound gets more serious, the film is still funny, especially at the furious and bloody showdown, which is not staged seriously again, but just fun as in Kill Bill.
positive;The sixth sence is just way too lame in some places...
positive;It's just a pity that the pre-trailer MACHETE doesn't really come to the cinema... I just found it hugely fat... :D:D:
negative;It is so fast that the pictures and colors fly around your ears.
positive;Goddamn it, that was a fright... oh my God!
positive;"; )"
positive;The horror elements sometimes seem a bit static and are processed linearly in a row.
negative;I hope for the next movie^^ The trailer seems to be quite good^^
positive;I can imagine that it does not affect men.
positive;For me the best movie of the cinema year 2007!
negative;I definitely can't recommend it.
negative;Visually, the film doesn't do much and it actually moves in a pretty small world.
positive;I enjoyed every minute of this movie and was a little sad when the end came - I could still have sat there forever...
positive;Of course, one can accuse the film of putting the sporting events in the foreground and portraying Mandela as an infallible saint.
negative;It's not a blockbuster, but it's not that bad.
positive;One of the five printers, who should be shot, always asserts to have done well his work and in the end is ready to betray and sacrifice someone else's life out of love for his own life.
positive;I'm sorry to have seen him on TV because the commercial breaks have always brought me out.
positive;After that, Laura made it to his Top5 with a hit.
positive;The cast I find personally top, Tommy Lee Jones as aging and unscrupulous CIA boss, Vincent Cassel as cold-blooded and relatively wordless killer and the relatively new Alicia Vikander, as a rising cyper specialist standing between the steels.
positive;Maybe a science fiction film, yes, but GRAVITY is not a typical science fiction film.
positive;A story that hasn't packed me like this in a long time and that included some surprise moments that, on top of that, caused me a lot of confusion, so I had to look at it twice more.
positive;Of course, the film has the â€ždas-can-one-but-not-unharmedâ€ scenes and in general I also have to say that it has been a little too long, but in large and overall it doesn ́t really stop.
positive;he is in his basic classical but nevertheless absolutely peculiar.
positive;I find the plot of the film exciting and action-packed, the different characters worked out well.
positive;it is a sad movie, but the exciting scenes you could have made something more exciting.
positive;I didn't read the book and would have to be clear to everyone that films never reach out to a movie.
positive;But I'm also afraid that something like that happens in the Harry Potter movies.
positive;The film is stylistically safe in every setting, almost sterile in a purely positive sense!
negative;Christoph Waltz' part seems a bit deplaced, the character just gives too little about the length of the film.
positive;One laugh chases the other.
negative;The film will please the audience, who prefers simple, somehow staged good-against-beast slaughter.
positive;"I would now immediately answer with ""yes"", even if she actually does not have one."
positive;To the good luck it was then also so, that the time passed during the movie as in flight and one at the end quite baff there sat.
positive;Really good movie have looked at him so many times and still find him good!!!!
positive;(Looked at him 3 times...) In the sense... Andreas
positive;The path Katja chooses is so very comprehensible and completes the character.
positive;After that, the film takes on a real drive and becomes a real thriller.
positive;"- ""A couple of cops."""
positive;A really beautiful film, which is totally to the heart, does not seem in any way exaggerated - especially through the music and the natural characters.
positive;If you don't like it, I don't think you need to look at it anymore.
positive;However, I liked this very much and also the partly somewhat overlaid and overdone representation I found suitable.
positive;A first-class drama, with great dialogues, convincing choreographed shootings, as we are used to by John Woo, an appealing story of friendship, love and revenge and a gripping finale.
negative;I mean, of course, such films don't have to be logical but a little bit more I've already expected apart from that it was missing from spannung. that's just a very rough description of my side, in the ground I can write about it which makes the film so incredibly bad but enough else I have to give myself over.I hope that there are even more healthy future people who are my opinion.
positive;What was perhaps not as good about the storyline was, as I learned, that it wasn't all true, but you could see very well how much the killer group suffered from their work (as Avner became paranoid).
positive;"When the film was finished, I thought to myself, ""So I could look at it for 5 hours!"""
positive;"Even if the trailer at first glance shows a movie inspired by ""transporter"", with just as much action etc., ""Drive"" is of a completely different genre, if not planets."
positive;(I liked the stink finger above all :-)And the action scenes are not of bad parents either.
negative;And NATÃœRLICH in the Spanish original (with subtitles).
negative;The actors did a really good job.
positive;The real genius lies in the fact that the outlaws actually have no reason to rebel against that law and to initiate a spiral of brutality.
positive;"Of course, such a ""killer"" is by no means authorized to intervene in the private life of people, but the film should only symbolize how much lies and fraud cause conflicts, which we can no longer even solve at some point."
positive;That's okay, but not too spectacular.
positive;Can't imagine anyone else.
negative;In any case, this film is too extreme in its statement that it could appear credible.
positive;"who, however, was a war movie like ""saving private ryan"" (was this actually a real treat?"
positive;Final Destination offers great entertainment and is perfect for a video evening (with preferably young guests), as it is also peppered with black humor and a lot of sarcasm in addition to the just as successful as creative death species, and it is easy to guess who is allowed to leave as next as the action.
positive;"If you understand what I mean ;-)."
positive;The film gets its 4 stars.
positive;Here you don't need to think about any corners.
positive;His Star Trek is so much homage to a pop-cultural phenomenon that has lasted for forty years, as it is also a brilliant transfer into a completely new dimension of the entire franchise.
negative;This is where Star Trek Beyond completely fails.
positive;the film has cult status for me!!!!
positive;Hammer's had a good time!
positive;Outstanding acting performance.
positive;That Trilian alias Zooe Deschanel is a dream woman, there is hardly any doubt about it.
positive;A film that has something to tell you in the long term - far from all the other films of others, which have neither sense nor reason.
positive;About the essence of my being.
positive;Maybe there's another two.
positive;Actor great chosen, but that was already in most other parts.
negative;It doesn't matter to me which direction a movie goes in, whether it's late or serious – just the balance has to be right.
positive;"Last night I was allowed to attend one of the premieres of the movie ""Tropic Thunder"" here in San Francisco."
positive;Of course, there's a lot of stuff blown up here, a lot of balled around and banged, but this actually only applies to the second half of the movie.
positive;Assuming that you have got involved in this, ozone manages in a fascinating way to drag its audience into the plot without getting caught up in unimportant details and thus to strike a high tension curve from the first to the last minute.
positive;Ralf
positive;"Well, now I also have to say something about the negative of the film: The scene where peter dancing and ""(un)cool roamed through NY are a bit ridiculously aba in the game with the otherwise rather sad sharing of the film nevertheless actually quite amusing."
positive;Humor, however, is omnipresent, though not in the form one laughs loudly, but rather in the form where one has a constant smile in the Munwinkel.
positive;Then there's Ronnie.
positive;So the acting performance of Naomi Watts was incredibly impressive!
positive;This should also take the studios to heart again...
positive;But also because the story is so gorgeously crazy!
positive;All in all, this is not even so terribly bad, it just jumps into your face and the contrast.
negative;But first of all to the plot: Everest is based on the true events of Mount Everest UnglÃ1⁄4ck in 1996.
positive;The human feelings and the sense of freedom, in spite of all human evils such as anger, hatred, war and destruction.
negative;It was always the same effects as in the first part.
positive;Awesome movie!!!
positive;"An exciting ""hypnotizing"" movie."
positive;Exciting, action-rich and a matching backdrop!
positive;Who expects a popcorn action movie here, will most likely get bored (I say now).
positive;Boy: You don't have anything to do with the coffee machine at home.
positive;Everything fits here: light story, great actors (up to the last supporting role), great pictures and a soundtrack of the one melts away.
positive;This film is basically suitable for every movie enthusiast - hard-core action fans have to stay out of it, but otherwise there are many cinematic aspects available: satire, action, cynicism, drama etc.
positive;[â€¦]â€žThe Purge: Anarchyâ€œ has at least a much more powerful train and drive in it than the predecessor and if one does not examine the tests at A-level, but takes them at B-level, all this can be endured.
positive;Especially in the scene between Brass and Epps would have been much more possible!
positive;The all but nothing changes that Scream is an absolute highlight, that you should absolutely look at!
positive;Finally, a little bit more to three other criticisms I read in other reviews.
positive;We have always discovered new facets.
negative;Abrahams as director of the series.
negative;So far so good, wouldn't this place-wise stupid dialogues destroy some.
positive;Very worth seeing..!
positive;And that's the whole movie.
positive;2 and on the first day I will enter the cinema.
positive;But this has already done other reviews and that is why I am not going into the content.
positive;the action scenes are unique and successful.
positive;What makes me happy?
negative;Last but not least, Ben Kingsley remains.
positive;Since the charges seem to have been used quite often.
positive;Anyone who has understood this message will be able to smile satisfied.
positive;I just watched the movie and I really like it.
positive;The film doesn't make the big tension arc.
positive;"With ""Cloud Atlas"" the Wachowski brothers and sisters and Tom Tykwer succeeded this excellently."
positive;definitely belongs to the cream de la cream as you say so beautiful!
negative;"Of course, they serve the credibility and the unwellness or the ""crushing"" of the viewer, but it reminds you again and again that this should only represent replayed scenes."
negative;But all this is not enough to get the film out.
positive;People don't anyway.
positive;Best Batman movie ever!
positive;Wolfgang Petersen created a monumental action blockbuster of superlatives...so much fun!
positive;(SPOILER END) If one can overlook these small inconsistencies, one is offered an oppressive, captivating film experience, that one in the one or the other scene quite lets one's breath thwart, not by shock effects (which occur in the movie almost not at all), but by the individual fates of the characters and their authentic memory.
positive;"""You think the bride now-"" then comes such a monster, the whole one or two more times and then ""JETZT KÖSS SIE schON ENDLICH !!!"""
positive;I think the story is great because it creates scenes like the shooting in the house or the dialogues between the two.
positive;Monsters absolutely scared to death, it comes to a mega-turn.
positive;Also the other actors are chosen appropriately and do their job well.
negative;Man of Steel is not as bad as Superman Returns, which, in my opinion, is not difficult.
positive;"Only the minutiÃ¶s choreographed and photographed sword duels are worth the entrance fee, whereby it is also thanks to Cruise's amazing adaptability, that as a non-Japanese in identification with the ""western"" thinking main character, one suspects something of the spirit of the Bushido that runs through this film like a red thread."
positive;"Despite all this, it was an enormous increase and even surpassed my high-legend expectation â€"" he was almost perfect."
positive;The man even learns the language of the Mohicans for a short time!
positive;John J. Rambo, a former Green Beret, defends himself against the excesses of overreaction and thus sets a chain of unfaithful events in force from which there seems to be no escape.
negative;And the envelope, which Billy hands over to Madolyn and which is oh so important, doesn't show up in the rest of the fimes anymore.
negative;4. When wormtail cuts off his hand, he doesn't scream at any more.Isn't it that he warms up in the book on the ground and whines.
positive;so black widow has to distribute properly to escape from a clinch with the hulk.
positive;Nor is it the intention of the film to offer any kind of historical truth.
negative;Winslet got the Oscar for the best leading actress.
negative;In the book there is the chronology of history and only one (very long) flash back (half book).
negative;The past is told multifaceted, but without any real connection.
positive;Inception, a movie I've been waiting for a long time.
positive;8/10
negative;Horror won't come up for a second.
positive;As said at the beginning Pacific Rim is a mix of Transformers and Godzilla and the fights against the house-high Kaijus are spectacular, gigantic, exciting and gripping.
negative;Not a good movie.
positive;Nix for mainstream movie watchers, everyone else should check in!
positive;So, look at it on a relaxed evening - alone, two, ten... no matter!
negative;The input sequence is i.
positive;Action is rather less, because for an uninhibited immoral outside story about two wonderfully in love heroes who blow away everything that stands in the way of them and their future - and since it is just a tarantino, for example, Alabama may just pop a policeman away and get away with it unpunished.
negative;Katana?
positive;"It's all unimportant."""
positive;No actor couple like Matthew Macfadyn & Keira Knightley has been able to present it as authentically as these two.
positive;"""like in Shoot Em Up like Wade Wilson/Deadpool Cynic SprÃ1⁄4cheklafer, which nothing is sacred."
positive;And so I see the whole movie he is very desirous for the first time.
negative;From the film I then went away, because I could not understand what the director aims for with all the picture compositions, plots and dialogues.
positive;You should also read Terry Pratchett if you're into something like that.
positive;The Limbus is a place to get to when you die in a deep dream.
positive;It is a mountain and valley ride of moods.
positive;One of the best German films.
positive;He's the old steamer who's against everyone.
positive;==References====External links==
positive;I'm just saying it's worth seeing.
negative;Even if the plot seems to be interesting to itself, it is unfortunately not originally Knostruiert, yes, even in the long term.
negative;Conclusion: Excessive, completely irrelevant finale, which exchanges the creative, cool ideas with which this series started against a lame zombie story!
positive;Maybe it's because I've seen a lot of very, very good thrillers lately and I don't like the movie that much, but otherwise Jodie Foster movies are actually better.
positive;Each setting of the film, each camera angle seems to be a separate object.
positive;The movie is just grenade and done.
negative;"""We just blow up a few ""system-relevant"" cities and say he (Dr. Manhatten) was and the whole world unites in joy their hatred of this""...hah."
positive;(and people with strong nerves, I can recommend Hustle to you...it's a bad thing:)
negative;CGI firework?
positive;So a movie that doesn't have anything special.
positive;I too, as the father of a 15-year-old daughter, come back to the Phänomen der Pupert a little piece more......
negative;So I didn't like the movie either...
negative;"""The Hobbit 2: The Desolation of Smaug"" can of course also entertain with the expressed sense of humor of the dwarfs."
positive;The fact that the whole thing is based on real events makes the film even more tragic.
positive;"In a previous scene everyone decides to take a ""silence minute""."
negative;It is a solid action Haudrauf thriller with old-established ingredients.
positive;Since that day I bought some CD's from Johnny Cash, the soundtrack to the movie I bought right after the first look at my friends.
positive;Found the balancing act successful and the film highly unusual.
positive;But Garfield shines with different caskets.
negative;The spark between the two main characters does not want to jump over.
positive;They become bitter competitors, they become dazzling media figures and they become marital men.
positive;The ninth day is a change in so many films that thmatize the Third Reich.
positive;Bernthal, Hamm and Foxx are also great psychos, which also fit perfectly into the overall work.
negative;Although he was not great and is also far from being my favorite comedy, he managed to entertain me super and proved much more charm than one could guess from the trailers.
positive;Horny and fancy superhero with lots of possibilities.
positive;Very successful film, Liam Neeson in absolute top form.
positive;(small remark: in part 2 there is a kind of death of superman by losing his power.
positive;Even if real critics of this film of the Jurassic series give much less points, it is for me almost as good as the first, although sequels, which only appear after many years, are actually no successes.
positive;Another gigantic film by Woddy Allen, which was in the drawer for far too long!
positive;So they tried to top the action from Bond to Bond over and over again.
negative;Take care of it, the same doll as SAW hides in the movie.
positive;But Eva Green is getting the chestnuts out of the fire.
positive;"Only one point bothers me immensely: that in the last scene ""Mr."
positive;The film shows almost two stories.
positive;It is German Jews who had fled Hitler-Germany, who now have to experience in their own right here in England of the 60s, what it means to be marginalized, just because they understand each other well with their neighbors who come from Jamaica.
positive;He is sent with his team, accompanied by a scientist, played by Kurt Russell, to free the plane before its landing, as there is probably a bomb on board.
positive;We already read on some pages, the movie doesn't have a really good story and is always the funniest when the minions simply play nonsense.
positive;My God...
positive;...where you get wet colds in the suit, where teenies die like flies, it's probably the killer in the mine.
positive;Instead, he goes free, unbound and with enormous joie de vivre on journeys and seems happier than anyone else.
negative;"So Rupert Sanders, known through music videos and commercials, is allowed to make a very own movie, which cost the studios millions of dollars, but the guys apparently thought: ""Hey, we haven't done anything totally stupid this year, how would it be?!"""
positive;Mills: What?
positive;I'd probably think of tens of logic mistakes I haven't seen before.
negative;"If you want to see a more recent movie with Cage, ""Pact of Revenge"", ""Tokarev"" or ""Joe"" are not outstanding, but still better than ""Drive Angry""."
positive;The music still sounds in my ears today, and I immediately bought the soundtrack album.
positive;Great hip hop with modern dance and classical dance music mixed with standard dances and then to the final all together.
positive;If I hadn't thought, I almost liked him better than the first part!
negative;Otherwise, however, the film bothered me mainly by its (optical) kitsch.
positive;At first still an annoying child who has only nonsense in his head, he will be likeable from minute to minute and would not have been better selected.
positive;I generally watch less animated films, but what's going on in the first 10 to 15 minutes is Oscar Reif!...
positive;Really just emotional and to think.
positive;"What happened in the film does not add anything, but also does not take anything â€"" is closed harmlessness in pure culture."
positive;But all in all you can say that the movie is very worth seeing and it is definitely worth watching in.
positive;Here the crisis is understood as an opportunity.
positive;As far as emotional productions are concerned, Clint Eastwood is ahead of us right now.
negative;The fact that the film is in black and white gives the already dreary atmosphere even more intensity.
positive;It is single and has to fight even with some difficulties.
positive;I've rarely seen an actor with so much deep feeling and enthusiasm about this.
positive;"Conclusion John Woo proves with ""Red Cliff"" that he has not yet left the film world."
positive;CAUTION SPOILER!!!!
positive;Ultrabrutal, very horny action, lots of martial arts & baller.
negative;The comedian Boon meets the diaphragm several times with facial expressions and rather by slapstick than with punctuality, but the viewer must wait for some successful staged fun, i.e. for the back section of the film, the confusion comedy.
negative;From the actress's inventory only John Goodman, who plays the cholerical-intriguing (The Big Lebowski lets greet) father of the bosses, convinces.
negative;And this is exactly what Stiller should have reduced his story better: A short film or from me actually a charming commercial series.
positive;Unfortunately, the film in the German version is partly strongly curtailed.
positive;"In the present case it is unfortunately so that one knows the outcome: an inconspicuous and understated moderator lures an former US president from incredible statements and insights - basically a variant of the Tom Cruise classic ""A Question of Honor"" and the one or other dramaturgical similarity may be given."
negative;Ordinary jokes and a semi-sense merging of the action lines/persons save the film.
positive;Today the film no longer looks so impressive, perhaps because the theme â€žStargateâ€ has been sucked out from the accompanying TV series to the border, perhaps also because the action and effects compared to Emmerich's successor works â€žIndependence Dayâ€œ and â€žThe Day after Tomorrowâ€œ are a little more economical.
positive;Conclusion: This time more attention is paid to story.
positive;This film is an absolute masterpiece with Dustin Hoffman in the role of his life.
positive;The finale was really brilliant and also the 10 small Negerlein game was not boring
positive;Like Moore's work, the scene is filled with hints and clues in the form of signs, posters, advertising messages, etc.
negative;The animations are for such a production under all cannon.
positive;was in november for the premiere in stuttgart: for the crowd in the metropol wars just a lot of humor!
positive;A name, which one hardly ever hears, is Warrior.
positive;There are also small movie mistakes in this movie.
positive;The movie has everything you want, perfect interplay of action and humor and Jason Statham shines in the leading role, a new superstar!
positive;WHAT FOR A FILM !!
negative;a rebellion looks somehow different.
positive;Conclusion: Intriguing and beautiful film of an unexpected friendship - full of heart and humanity!
positive;I am of the opinion that there is no conclusive interpretation since there are in the film itself, sufficient closing moments, which dissolves an opposite event.
negative;Conclusion: Rapid change of scene and great pictures.
positive;So then, not 24 hours after the first pleasure, I'm going back on my journey to the Inland Empire.
positive;In plain language, the realization of the self, the whole becoming of the human being, leads to a fundamental conflict, which can only be solved by the abolition (suspension) of the opposites.
positive;The explanation is very logical in contrast to many other thrillers, which strongly reminds of the old Sherlock Holmes novels.
positive;Even if you already know from the beginning, because of the initial sequence of the film, how it ends around Carlito, you still suffer with him until the end - just great done!
positive;Was funny and late.
positive;So important.
positive;Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother to her new stepfather, an always uniform-bearing captain in a remote mountain region.
negative;Imagine you hear your favorite song with which you connect good memories on the radio and as he slows down driving, just before the chorus comes a traffic message and the feeling is gone.
positive;It's a great man.
positive;One of the most entertaining films of the genre, and next to â€žLechen paves its wayâ€œ and â€žDjangoâ€ , surely one of the best films of Sergio Corbucci.
positive;The strange case of Benjamin Buttonâ€œ is a film that impresses with the great story on the one hand.
negative;Start right at the beginning, bigger is not better and they still haven't understood that.
positive;the end was brilliant to my opinion, because it was action-packed, funny and very tragic and above all I would have answered exactly at the place so...
positive;But also Scorsese's presentation IS excess, he is a maestro of the archetypal perspective, which can be misunderstood here as easily as unreflected, as some do not recognize the conscious intention behind the tens of small connection errors in the psycho thriller â€žShutter Islandâ€œ.
positive;Look!
negative;The notebook, a romance with a not quite so new plot.
positive;Very High Sentimental Moment - and heartbreaking beautiful.
positive;Quickly, Capt.
negative;The crown puts on the whole spectacle the broken end.
positive;The question still moves me, why there are such clear limits: Those who are so taken away by the film, those for whom it is nothing else but everyone else, and those who can't do anything at all with it, clearly stand out from each other.
positive;But here it has succeeded to set a monument to an ingenious Swedish writer.
negative;Lethal intention, but the result then turns out to be gross and disgusting because not one of the figures has any likeable or possible property and one sits in front of this kaleidoscope of ass-holes rather baffled in front of it.
positive;And - either you swallow these dramaturgical creatures - or switch off after this turn.
negative;Defend yourselves!
positive;In addition to the freshly baked couple, Mrs.
positive;Admittedly, the whole thing is already somewhat desirable and sometimes changes somewhat too extreme between joke and seriousness, so that one either with rather sad places still laughs, before one realizes that it is not the right time at all - or even the joke at first does not perceive at all as one, so important were the previous events.
positive;With attention to detail in every picture.
negative;And that it's not true about the novel, just like the Weak Screenplay.
positive;First of all, one has to say that this part is not comparable to the first part, but to lengths is better than the fourth.
negative;Apart from the fact that it is probably nice to give this film 10 points or that some people see themselves over the not a few rather bad reviews of this film hurt for some reason (maybe you can also see one or the other truth at one or the other point of criticism), this film also seems rather weak to me.
positive;A further Oscar can secure the visual effects, which are also these, especially in one place simply stunning.
positive;Everything is comprehensible, nothing is overlaid and much is not predictable.
positive;With an attractive look, ingenious actors and great music, the story of the paranoid mathematician, who glides from the reality, is masterfully told.
positive;The film offers a wonderful staging of action, humor and excitement that is just too perfect!
positive;Every seeing and listening person, who would like to have fun with this film, should like it to me and make a wide bow around the frightful German synchro.
positive;So must look horror, and thus The Descent is in my opinion the work with which future films must measure themselves.
positive;Seraphim Falls has become a really strong and rousing Western, which can convince above all with its authenticity.
positive;The transformation of the emotionless post director trapped in everyday work, whose marriage seems to be at the end of their days and to whom the high-ranking jobs are to remain blocked, into a person who gets involved in a new life and in this completely new bloating, is simply refreshingly beautiful.
positive;I've had a conversation with you.
positive;The more I saw the movie, the stronger I was emotionally moved.
negative;The actors are good and played their part well.
negative;But as drugs there were mainly the classics alcohol and cigarettes.
positive;Criticism: I did.
negative;"The second time ""Army of Darkness"", after many years, has not convinced me so closely."
positive;In addition, the sincronisation is left to be desired.
positive;It is a complaining at a high level, because the positive aspect outweighs.
positive;The look is simply the best thing a movie ever had to offer.
positive;By far the best Ghibli movie ever!
positive;This kind of unity, of conspiratoriality, has disappeared in the last 10 to 15 years as far as possible.
positive;Thank you.
positive;Meanwhile, it seems that BuscapÃ© cannot live up to his childhood dream of becoming a photographer (as opposed to Locke).
negative;"For my taste the film has far too little action (which really starts after an hour)-for beautiful pictures I prefer to watch ""Our Earth""."
positive;But this movie exceeds all my expectations and is better than part 1 - only recommended
positive;"But Larry succeeds in mobilizing the whole museum and bringing all the ""exhibition pieces"" back to the museum by sunrise."
negative;It just doesn't seem as round as in the first part.
positive;His wealth of ideas and his ability to observe is fascinating, with which he turns people's heads.
positive;If you have liked scoreses Good Fellas or Casino, you will certainly not be disappointed by Departed.
positive;"Here it is not again about \""bÃ¶se Häuser\"" or \""iergendenwelchen Geister\""."
positive;But I still like the nasty tricks with which the girls deal each other, e.g. the pussy or cady's flirting with Regina's friend.
negative;During this time Anna comes into the room of Antonio and thinks she would be paid by his friends, but he knows nothing about it and doesn't even know these so-called friends.
positive;At least 6 more points would be in it!
positive;Regardless of that, dear ladies: it is the film's death of Johnny Depp (in the belly-free t-shirt, the real horror!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive;However, the fight scenes are questionable in certain places.
negative;After all, the end is consistent again and the film is photographed quite well in places.
positive;however, it also cleverly complements with symbolic scenes (baseball field), underscores them with ironically used music (like â€œWhat a wonderful Worldâ€œ) and allows the dialogues to seem wonderfully sarcastic, since the viewer is always aware of the outcome of the respective situation.
negative;Of course, all are younger and fresher and come differently.
negative;Absolutely exciting and fast telling spitted with good acting performance of all actors.
positive;Watchmen simply convinces by the somewhat different hero story.
negative;Under conditions suitable for falling asleep.
positive;This great 70s music, which just makes fun and where it is also worth buying the soundtrack here.
negative;But of course the knot will blow through.
positive;The gags were original and especially to laugh to death.
positive;One laugh chased the other and when the movie was over, I would have preferred to be back on Play again to watch it from the beginning.
positive;To this brilliant authenticity contribute naturally also the actors.
positive;Although he's actually playing the same as Captain Jack Sparrow, it's going to be groggy and wagging twice as well in front of the incredible Terry Giliam's camera.
positive;But the tiger won't fall off.
negative;I have had high expectations of this film, not least due to the extremely positive reviews at filmstarts.de I have to find out unfortunately: My expectations have been unmasked on the whole line.
positive;So he's not bad, a gag firework like the old Bully movies but also not bad, but that should be the case.
positive;Hats off to Tilda Swinton.
positive;Sharpens the knives: after his harsh blood orgy â€žSleepy Hollowâ€œ cult director Tim Burton continues this tradition and creates an imposing, enormous black fairytale that cannot be surpassed in equipment, food and wild camera rides.
positive;Maybe he's really just a criminal.
positive;"An all-round successful film and one of the strongest George Clooney films of which there were fortunately some in recent years (""Syriana""; ""Good Night, And Good Luck""; ""Up in the Air"")."
negative;This is a film for friends of the Arthouse cinema, these can expect two moving and very strenuous film hours.
positive;Just great and absolutely worth seeing!
positive;Go in the right direction!
positive;and embark on the journey/search for Horcruxen.
positive;First of all, ma.
positive;What more do you want?
positive;And then this imagery!!!
positive;The director's preface alone is brilliant!!!
negative;I had not read the book, so I can write nothing more than probably failed to implement it.A beautiful piece consisting of beautiful pictures, but no trace of captivating or accompanying.
positive;She plays convincingly and is still damn good and natural.
positive;George W. Bush: History?
positive;Harry Potter 6 (9 out of 10) (reason: as described) 2.
positive;I also noticed the German reference, but is before a sophistication of the film.
positive;In addition, Idiocracy is an entertaining comedy, with numerous gags, great stage pictures, endless details and top actors.
positive;30 min.
positive;This part must be between parts 2 and 3, because in part 3 he dies.
positive;Only the fast cuts of the action scenes bother me, but this seems to be just an annoying fashion of this cinema generation, which even Abrams can't escape despite old virtues.
negative;that's just missing in this movie.
negative;Only the first 15/20min with Christopher Walz are worth watching the film, the rest is so clumsy that you don't want to watch it at all.
negative;"3/4 of the film looked like a particularly bad episode of the already bad series ""Hotel""."
positive;Since WoW has both incredibly many fans but at least as many haters, Universal was incredibly skeptical.
positive;And that can only mean that Ramsay knows exactly what she wants when she creates a movie.
positive;In the end, however, this kind of audience understands only railway station.
positive;Sickness :)???
positive;Peter Jackson, with the Lord of the Rings Triology himself and even the books, presents us now his new film.
positive;Pacino shows here a his best achievements at all and delivered us with his great speech at the end something very special.
negative;You just keep looking to find out what happens at the end.
negative;:) funny, macabre, scary, beautiful!
negative;Neither gags nor cool talk.
positive;Director and leading actor Roberto Belingni succeeds the Kunststück the film in two substantial halfs, as they could not be more different, to pass through in a commemorative style.
positive;Something sad is that humor and punchiness don't come across as charming as in the first part.
negative;A few things I'd like to get explained in the movie: Why don't the aliens fight back despite their weapons?
positive;"Instead of sterile CG blockage, ""€TMs are ground-breakingly hard on the gears and in some cases really roughy is brought around the corner, especially when the title-giving assassin intervenes in the event: like in the Cap, SuperKRAFT has nothing to do with flying, repulsor or lightning in the Winter Soldier, but with agilitity, exhausted physical limits, and just KRAFT, one supported by its vibranium shield, the other by a bionic arm."
positive;"Quants (= programmers who work in the financial world) are depicted as childish freaks or suspicious half-world figures; that's really silly."
positive;A woman would be terrified, but unfortunately, it looks so unrealistic that I'm worried about it.
positive;That's what happened most of the time... just think of the bad remakes of the Batman Animated Series or of He-Man, or Fantastic Four 2.
positive;By the way, I found the three colorful pigeons, one of them with the synchronous voice of Dr. House.
positive;Through the bloody did by Barr, the spectator is immediately awakened.
negative;For example, the sometimes missing language understanding between men and women is shown really funny.
positive;Casino Royle could never have been filmed with Pierce Brosnan.
positive;I can't understand if the director is criticized for not knowing what he wants to tell.
positive;Wow, maybe the best acting I've ever seen.
negative;In this respect, I would recommend the film, if nothing else comes on the weekend, but unfortunately the ''Outbreak'' can not stand out from the usual disaster films.
negative;so somehow a back and forth - know myself ned from XD
positive;Awesome camera and cut.
positive;Highly recommended.... the exaggerated text of the Evil Dead poster may be kept right :D
negative;However, he could not publish the works himself due to his status.
positive;This is how it also unfolds its effect.
positive;However, you should note that it is a documentary and not an action film or drama.
positive;Yeah, it's been kind of creepy since then.
positive;But I have to say that I liked the movie very much.
positive;There the large-scale New York, where you have to box through, anonymity is large written.
positive;You can watch the movie so often without it getting boring.
positive;They seem really free only in moments when they are completely isolated from their outer world at their refuge at Brokeback Mountain.
positive;Perfect!
negative;"In summary, I would call the film ""very nice""."
positive;So I give the filming of this true story for intensity an 8 on the 10 scale.
positive;fit perfectly into it and did his thing best.
negative;Even if his films are made by well-known actors, it is not a mainstream but a very own world, it stands with a strange atmosphere that is somehow cheerful, sad and thoughtful at the same time.
positive;I have already looked at him several times and learn to protect him again and again.
negative;Nevertheless, the film is on long distances trÃÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ a a female film film is a women film film. film. film. film. film.
positive;"""Illuminati"" is, in my opinion, a pound!"
positive;Scream 2 is a real roller coaster ride for the stomach!
positive;Christian Slater stands out in particular.
negative;Often from one scene to the next, from one character to the opposite.
positive;The film tied me up from the first minute to the last minute and the 138 minutes went by as if in flight.
positive;The night before the wedding, all sorts of entanglements and turbulence with an unexpected finale... Katherine Hepburn shines in one of her best roles.
positive;"From the beginning one finds pure tension; humor as a bombur plays the rotating barrel; as Legolas jumps from head to head to come across the river."
positive;"from the tv series ""scrubs""."
positive;A lot of good has already been written about the film, and I can only agree.
negative;in his new job.
positive;This is shown here by the Burnham family, in which Lester Burnham, husband of a purely materialistic woman and a daughter who is in puberty, tries to break out of this outer appearance and make a more beautiful and genuine life.
positive;He may only want to be recognized and succeed once.
positive;Thus pictures from Bruno's past are reflected in glasses.
positive;The best in trilogy
negative;With every further stripe the Wayans boys become more irreplaceable by now, because definitely unpleasant.
positive;Can you live with it if the prince doesn't get the princess?
positive;We both didn't feel that way.
positive;Exciting investigations, good dialogues (German translation) and actors.
negative;Which makes him almost a slave to mother Angelika.
positive;Thanks to good timing, however, the rest of the cast, from which apart from the Sarandon already mentioned above, above all Meat Loaf, Nell Campbell stand out as a better variant of Bonham-Carter and not least author Richard Oâ€ ̄Brien as a bubbly valet, gets the attention they are entitled to.
positive;The whole humor is omnipresent, but never seems ridiculous.
positive;Jeremy Renner I found now not quite succeeded, his figure seemed somehow too shaky and had actually only the function of a sparring partner for the Louise played by Amy Adams.
positive;starting with the S
negative;There would have been much more to get out of.
positive;At the end, when the baby screamed, the tears came to me, before happiness!
positive;Very horny movie, I haven't laughed like that in a long time!!
negative;Especially not to such a known, The question, why he is so famous, remains.
positive;"Until the noticeable end I found the film great, after I read through the review of ""Christoph"", makes a lot of sense for me and will probably watch the film again."
positive;So it's something like an end-time vampire dystopia.
positive;"Like ""What is Death?"""
positive;Asia Crime at its best.
positive;Simple story that shows so much depth that you watch eagerly.
positive;Loosely told, very nice story, very good performer and a very nice pointe.
positive;"Conclusion: Joel and Ethan Coen return to the big stage with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" and the spectators will probably cheer them more than their title character."
positive;BREAKDOWN: SPOIL WARNING!
positive;Nevertheless: within the scope of the possibilities the prayer what was feasible and it definitely increases the anticipation for a further episode.
negative;In addition, the characters move so quickly from place to place that it simply makes no sense.
negative;At traffic accidents at the intersections and in the tunnel you might scratch your head and wonder how such a thing is possible at all?
positive;Not to create a wrong image Love Exposure is by no means an action film, with any kind of explosions and shootings from the computer, which, like Hollywood, is trying to convince us for years to be incredibly exciting, but by now are only for you to guess.
negative;"), in addition absolutely humorous and irony-free and thus one can start with the characters sometimes even nothing, because 0 sympathy or understanding arises; the only tension, which is held over almost 3 hours, is the hope that finally something happens ... from that one really could make a nice row Ã la X-MEN, then would have been also more time for the backstories, but so I have as rarely worried to have 6.20 and 3 hours lifetime in the Gulli to throw ... sorry, but the time to gaze at a white wall makes just as much sense!"
negative;That the story is banana, the actors act on spar flame, this is all justifiable and was somehow expected... Please don't misunderstand, although I also liked High Tension and Inside doesn't need a high Gore content for me to be good, I love Obliche Verdächtigen or Brick, Dark Knight is also great, but with Rogue I just expected a little more blood.
negative;there were good ones there, only the execution was miserable.
positive;on the one hand the great optical implementation, as well as the landscape photos, even if it was created to a relatively large part with the help of CGI.
negative;But Death Race didn't like that at all, because the rest of the film is built on it, very weak!!!
positive;Conclusion: A magical love drama with a lot of feeling.
positive;Snowman Olaf is really funny, but I can't help but say that he reminds me a little bit of Sid from Ice Age, here, after my feeling, a little bit of copper was removed.
negative;The construction of feelings against the individual actors is never presented in detail or the psychology of the individual actors is always somehow unbelievable or not to understand.
positive;My could easily make two even better films with both themes.
positive;Top plot, top effects, top performers, just everything MEGA!
negative;And so the film hangs itself from an action spectacle to the next and then finally loses every AMbition to tell a story.. Micheal BAY is already slowly no longer a victim.. Too many things this man does are so inconvenient that even internet critics will have to scold this man..
positive;Most of them are already busy with new film projects.
positive;Every scene with Will Ferrell is funny and always when Uma Thurman appearance is good mood announced.
positive;It's just a pity that there's very little comment in the movie.
positive;And if one or the other tear scene appears too much, the viewer still does not experience the sadness as an artificial.
positive;Some people think that from the Harry Potter 5 all movies should be bad!
positive;I've already seen her better.
positive;The mood feels very good to me, through the calm that the film radiates, my breathing through depth can consciously prepare for constant tension, which is then never overloaded, as with some movies.
positive;The perfect image composition creates absolute tension and sucks you into the action.
positive;"So how should this guy ""use"" the syringe?"
positive;Perhaps a little more courage from Marvel would have been more consistent.
positive;In my opinion, some dubbing voices were not good, but this is supposed to be the only flaw in this movie.
negative;On the other hand, the two main actors give partly so harsh and completely dry comments, in this suitably sterile butcher's shop, that one can amuse oneself can.
negative;Dollar out and makes as good as no advertisement for this movie and wonders about the missing cinema visitors.
negative;Structure and structure is perfect, no logic leaks.
negative;"Shock scenes were also not saved (Highlight: a ""swallowed"" baseball locker!)"
positive;I already said something about Pretty Woman.
positive;I'm really surprised!
negative;Maybe he should leave it on smaller topics and not always deal with the very big problems.
positive;The actors are neat and I can recommend the movie to anyone who likes to see comedies.
positive;Best movie in a long time.
positive;Especially the overpowered and exaggeratedly depicted banker world has provided for many laughs.
negative;And that's how simple and plump many moviegoers are to manipulate.
positive;Part of the spat again and again, as the parody is parodyed again.
positive;A very untypical movie, because made in U.S.A.
negative;Even this whole â€œTrust no oneâ€œ agent-number I found only boring, because I â€œ contrary to my kind â€œ at any time knew who was playing wrong and who was not.
positive;I thought Watney was cool and refreshing.
positive;"He owns McFarlane's voice, which also lends his voice to Peter Griffin in the series success ""Family Guy""."
positive;De Niros Performance is also very good.
positive;Here no one wants to go and who it like our pitiful protagonist, there missing, wants also as fast as possible away again.
positive;This movie deserves the full score!
positive;While his father tries to teach him to make more of his life than he himself and not to take anyone's back view, his mother is warmhearted and brings him to progress through life with kindness and respect.
negative;I hope the next blockbuster is then again with KNALL, BUMM and much, much PENG.
positive;I saw the movie in 3D.
positive;I liked this movie very much.
negative;It's more like an average movie.
positive;He plays a lot with the tempo, much is shown in slow motion.
positive;On the one hand, I somehow miss the long, but interesting introduction of new characters, the new ones are anyway shallow like a smaller feet.
positive;Usually two more sequences are shot, the quality of which is strictly monotonous (paradise example: â€žThe Matrixâ€œ or â€žFlight of the Caribbeanâ€œ).
positive;For someone not questioned and hoping for a movie with which he can lean back and relax is this nothing.
negative;Imagine the Alps as a lowland.
positive;PS: One more thing I want to get rid of..
positive;The film begins excitingly, and remains until the end, the viewer is constantly led around the nose, there are new exclamation signs in the room, with which one has to cope.
positive;And honestly how great was the story of Reservoir Dogs???
positive;Note: If you want to watch the film in the original tone, you should prepare yourself for the really strong Wyoming accent, it is quite difficult to understand everything.
negative;You really don't have to watch the movie.
negative;I find that especially the films with antiheroes have a great potential for tapping out.
positive;As I expected: the reviews of this film are very strongly polarized!
negative;"James Horner's score (after Gabriel Yared's version was rejected as ""too old-fashioned"" after a year of work) is also appropriate, lame, repetitive and uninspired."
positive;The atmosphere is definitely strong.
negative;Well.
positive;"parallel to michael bay's ""transformers"" destruction orgies can be logically drawn, but in contrast to bay weiß whedon deal with total chaos."
positive;so at least it comes so soon !!
negative;"To the movie ""The fabulous world of Amelie"": The story is basically not bad and also sometimes something completely different, but through the length of the film (117 min) the actual story in it loses itself."
positive;"Emily Browning showed herself already in ""Sucker Punch"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" from her best side and makes this again nice to watch."
positive;It is more a part of many equal influences, experiences and feelings that the title hero of the world and his followers learn and experience through them and from them.
negative;A classic Tarantino, with sharp dialogues and great music background.
positive;Also the entire rest of the cast plays matching and convincing.
negative;Some scenes I mean to have understood correctly.
positive;It's worth seeing.
positive;But this is too painful, because it is carried on later anyway and does not stop the movie.
positive;Also visually the film can convince, everything looks very thirsty and bleak, in addition comes a lot of action, which was well set in scene.
positive;Which also takes its course quite quickly.
positive;Parkers Turner is a revenge angel as he stands in the book, a liberator who does not want to persuade the underdogs but kill them.
positive;Our main characters around Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) are the best drilling team far and wide and are trained for this daring experiment to become astronauts...
negative;There's no drama, just dull entertainment, and I've had enough of that this year.
positive;Of course, boxing is not neglected, and expect a perfectly insinated fight within the ring.
positive;"That's why I decided to borrow ""The Waisenhaus""."
positive;Who stands for effective action-gathering or delusional comedies, should definitely not go into this movie.
positive;I can't help but give all five stars.
positive;Once again, this film was also the humor brilliant.
negative;All those who went out with the movies were disappointed
positive;The Joker made everything much more discreet and came out of nowhere to attack Batman.
positive;Although the basic need is the same as in the first part (inner quarrels, short separation, but in the end they fight together again), nevertheless Joss Whedon manages to make it work differently.
positive;Emma Stone's facial expressions are incredibly haunting, even too intensely taken up in some attitudes.
positive;"Wall-E was last year next to ""Burn after Reading"" (which unfortunately I haven't seen yet) one of those movies, in which opinions are quite different."
positive;For that one experiences much about their soul, especially in the songs, the dialogues are minimalistic.
positive;It's also defensively one of the best movies I've ever seen, but also very heavy food.At the beginning I had a good time getting deeper and deeper into this beautiful dark atmosphere, but that was after approx.
positive;stephan
negative;I think Luc Besson had a few instances of scenes and then tried to wrestle these scenes.
positive;One of the craziest horror/psychofilms I've seen.
negative;And where was the red thread, please?
negative;One could still enjoy this encapsulation forever!
negative;There's no such thing as suspense at any time, and Bale goes under in the role of FBI agent.
positive;Only minus point: The story is partly already known and therefore loses some tension!
positive;Asian films have it hard on the European and American market.
positive;You should have seen him!
positive;"And that's from no one else but the professor who takes the children into his house in ""The King of Narnia""."
negative;"At some point you're intimidated by events, you don't know what's coming from where and even suspects in the score a parellele to the BAM BAM BAM... from the ""Terminator"" movies."
positive;Nothing with explosions and action, but history is written here - and that's good.
negative;The film contains nothing more than concentrated two hours of frustration, howling women driven by the desire for suicide, who seem to break up in apparent problems, whereby I lose any kind of motivation to these thoughts, since the suicide seems to be a pure end in itself, in order to press the viewer on the trance and deliver a skilled film.
negative;But you still miss the eccentricity, the style security of ''Kill Bill'' and ''Pulp Fiction'' enormously.
positive;It's different.
positive;Before the shooting of the scene, in which the fireman in the stairwell is killed by the fall, the actors involved were not informed that there will be a said fall.
positive;Unbelievable good!
positive;A film is a film and should be seen as a peculiar version.
positive;The review of the editorial office brings it however very nice to the point: because the whole becomes first from the society portrait, to the love drama and then to the thriller, Match Point is so very successful.
positive;Always weirder, actually looking at each time more funny!
positive;Unfortunately, I have never been able to climb but Joe's situation is well understood.
positive;Grandios played by Kevin Spacey.
positive;I did not find their behavior illogical: A closed (bedroom) door can not prevent a demon from opening it, it is not for nothing demon with extraordinary abilities.
positive;After this Batman you can love the old films, the water can pass them to him on almost hardly any level (even Zimmer/Newton Howard's music can keep up with Elfman, which is simply because Nolan brings the Flattermann to earth, does not present us invincible and within the framework of fiction rather a kind of realism instead of wild flood of images into the series.
positive;And so it is.
positive;Two things I'd like to say.
negative;These passages are all staged in a dröge.
negative;"But since he cannot fight, he forms ""the union of the super evil villains""."
positive;The director knew how to put the viewer in fear and terror from the beginning and with a tremendous intensity, as is rarely the case with a film of this kind.
positive;Now in 2017 she remains true to her themes.
positive;That coolness that surrounds him, wonderful!
negative;It's almost not happening.
negative;Too bad I'm looking forward to every superhero filming.
positive;On the one hand, the story is a real rage movie.
positive;In addition, the backdrops and meals have been wonderfully implemented.
positive;(I don't want to betray too much) There are some scenes in the movie that really make you think extremely hard and especially cry.
positive;I mean that the story can be set equally well with the actors on steels in circles and the dialogues can be filmed speakingly.
positive;You didn't stand a chance!
positive;Here Keanu Reeves landed a famous comeback.
positive;The imagery and the camera rides are brilliant!
positive;Or not.
negative;Well, my taste is not necessarily mainstream, but the co-inmates in the cinema weren't much more of a laugh.
positive;recommend to introduce this film as a small themed example to pädagogik and human rights violations.. it is always more credible than sommelllicher Mist which was placed before me at that time..
negative;Such films can no longer be made in the third millennium: creaking boards and doors that strike by themselves...
negative;All the flashbacks show only the separation of Neville from his wife and daughter, the overall impression is not clear.
positive;Can do anything in this beautiful review.
positive;"""Birdman"" is visually and acoustically a small masterpiece and keeps one trapped until the last minute."
negative;You just have the feeling that LaBeouf doesn't want to play this role anymore and wants to bring it over to the office quickly.
positive;Why 10 stars?
positive;That at the end (not directly after the first meeting of course) a friendship between the two men arises, I personally find absolutely remarkable.
negative;Only landscape fans get their money's worth here.
negative;"And when you go home, you can say, ""The movie was really deep."""
negative;So what else could have been that in the movie?
positive;Finally, I have to praise the actors who really (almost) all did a great job.
positive;The film would also have worked with any other pair of screens, that it is just the two are raising the film but powerfully.
positive;"However, this again implies that you actually push ""children"" weapons into your hand without them knowing exactly what the whole situation now means."
positive;"Great to look at even if you are ""too old"" for that."
positive;On the one hand again through the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand, which are once again suitable as the perfect scene for Middle Earth.
positive;THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE FEARED.
positive;Greens
negative;for tripper hangs - oh my god...
negative;But mystery and poetry are missing.
negative;Unfortunately, the film couldn't convince me!
positive;September 2012 was, the topic came up again.
negative;the movie really didn't appeal to me
positive;I find the Wild guys just super horny as I play my 5 years of life also soccer I like to watch this movie.
positive;First, you can only put the action down if you found it bad in the game.
positive;Of course he does not get close to part 1 in the overall conclusion because he was simply more original and this number actually only a gossip.
negative;How can anyone rate such nonsense well!?
positive;I just came from the movie with my father, who was thrilled like a 5 year old child over a lollipop.
positive;It goes right to the point, body parts fly and Eli is introduced as a cool but sympathetic sow.
positive;The and also advertising poster make the movie look like a typical fight B movie.
positive;You can't fall over this masterpiece in any way.
positive;Hobbs deletes the data of the crew at the end of the sixth part, says even you are free and yet Shaw picks up the data on the PC, well, maybe so =).
negative;No single moment is called into question the course of the killing.
negative;They make up the flair of Hawaii first.
positive;Marvel fans have their joy.
positive;Guaranteed are some funny scenes at which one can hardly avoid one or the other laugh.
positive;The clues are too obvious to compromise about Ben Affleck's character, the crime is too much planned and the sheer absence of other perpetrators makes it necessary to mention this variant.
positive;If it comes to the action sequences then hold on.
positive;That's what I call good conversation.
positive;Only a few films manage to raise so profound questions.
positive;The interpretation of the whole is probably at the discretion of the spectator and his moral conception.
positive;your karicia!!!!!!!!!!!
positive;However, Brad Pitt is clearly a great hit of the film: as a completely crazy and freaky psychopath he is somehow funny, yet somehow frightening.
negative;Clint Eastwood didn't like to shoot a movie that bad in his selection.
negative;I liked the idea with the bionetworking.
positive;But in the third year everything will be different.
positive;There were so many moments when things happened that were perfect, but at the same time you couldn't imagine them.
positive;Here you can download the film in high quality German high quality translation Follow the link and download
negative;I think it would be better if the film had either a completely open end or 2 turns.
positive;One could find even more small criticisms.
positive;What I liked very much was the plot.
positive;These two films live from a meeting of heroes and one here more, there less, but still unnecessarily complicated plot, which distracts from the actual confrontation.
negative;In short, a rather bad movie.
positive;would have given 10 points if the film were still 10-15min longer.
positive;However, this proves to be more difficult than thought.
positive;The idea to tell history anew, but to move it to the American New England 200 years later, was a daring and at the same time skillful idea.
positive;This time the main spectacle takes place in the tropics, which is very good for me scenically.
positive;The film is simply unique and is also so super accepted because it does not show primitive horror movies or anything else.
negative;Unfortunately, how to do a second part well, Mr. Raimi has actually shown
positive;The effects and tastes, especially for the 70s scenes are great.
positive;Although they don't always have a lot of text, they still seem authentic.
positive;But that's all you can do, otherwise mnan gets a tadeless movie full of heart, humor and small, quirky moments.
negative;"For 7 euros you should rather borrow 2 good pornos in the video library...;) There you have more of!"
positive;Time and again it is memorized here that in Wortmann's summer months the mood in the country does not change, that the fan miles are missing.
positive;Even after that, I had to think really long about what I saw.
positive;It was for me something completely new and individual and naturally the Burton flair comes over perfectly.
positive;A very quiet film to me economical dialogues, the inner advantages can be read on the faces.
positive;==References==<br>
positive;one of the best gangster movies I've seen.
negative;"b) In the stylish apartment of the scientist (Ethan Hawke) there are several times the following occurrence: one hears a gently performed ""security alert"" from the off, and immediately stands - completely without noise o.ä."
positive;"The only thing is the ""wax camera"" however, this brings up the authentic atmosphere."
positive;"The books often consist of a lot of historical details and epic monologues that Robert Langdon holds; in a film it's so difficult to put that into; then brings a bit of spectacular and hardly interesting backgrounds."
positive;Tip: Crank 3 is already turned but this time in 3D in Bullet Time (timer) if you put the 3D glasses on then the balls in slow motion come to you.
positive;Steven Spielberg tells one of the most beautiful stories at all and one of the best emotional children's films.
positive;The story???
negative;Arlo & Spot is pretty much the opposite.
positive;It's all right in Star Trek II.
negative;Affleck earns $120,000 a year in the movie (gross) and John Wells tries to make the viewer actually know that he has nothing Erpsartes, and can not even afford a game console for 180â‘¬ anymore.
negative;...discovery!
positive;Yes - the movie is not a laugh.
positive;From the cheap cardboard scenes, over actors to (in my opinion) uninteresting stories.
positive;Definitely not a mainstream movie.
positive;Besides crying and sobbing during the film I can only dagen: True love waits!!!
positive;"If I transport Transformers to undeserved heights with the foundation ""He just makes fun and that's why"" then why not this film too?"
positive;Very big plus point: The reactions and decisions of the couple are finally (oh wonder) quite logical, logical and comprehensible.
negative;I'm unchallenged.
positive;Well, of course, the question has to be answered by everyone for themselves, but in my opinion all three parts are on almost the same (high) level.
positive;But this is not to say that the film is boring and it is not worth watching the film.
positive;First class actors.
positive;Also, the film is not overloaded by special effects, as still with X-Men: Apocalypse.
positive;I have such an idea for a movie as would it be if I told you?
positive;And let's be honest, this is Bond as we want to see him: he lays the women flat (although in men), shoots the wolf (from the license to kill is almost a license to shoot) and has a sharp-bubish smile on his face with everything that may happen to him.
negative;So far the worst part of the series (5&6 not seen yet).
positive;The food was very nice, so this movie is for the eye.
negative;The remaining 121 episodes were only shown in the early 1990s by ProSieben and the cable channel (as well as its successor Kabel 1).
positive;This is initially somewhat confusing, but ultimately not less entertaining - and not only in artistic, but also in direct respect.
positive;He is so fascinating that I tried to understand the film during that night.
negative;Not my case, but I don't want anyone else to suffer it.
positive;Here the darker mood is transported unbelievably well, that you can protect the whole time stunned with the head.
negative;Stylistically, the old films came much closer to the template than this one.
positive;It is one of those films that you have to watch several times, because you have the feeling that you have not yet noticed everything or as here also the history is not quite easy to understand.
positive;The new Bully movie arrived with the critics mostly only medium-sized.
positive;This film has everything...from beautiful music and beautiful voices over good actors to great food...all in all a wonderful masterful film...even for people who have nothing with classical music or musicals at the hat this film will be an experience!
positive;He just knows how to make the bat his game ball.
positive;Robert DeNiro is in top form again and portrays the psychopath Max Cady like no other!
positive;It's a good movie.
positive;What I was particularly mean about was that the main character, in his need, could not talk to her to explain everything to her.
positive;The story is told great and much more beautifully brought back by effects and the actors.
positive;And MTV shows only what moves the mass and finds great (escaflowne e.g.).
positive;So the film is not only a mere horror, but also a punctual fausthieb in the American establishment of the time.
positive;A bunch of reporters gather around his body.
positive;In my opinion there are only very few movies (a handful) that earn 10 points - and Oldboy belongs to me clearly.
positive;Ghost in the Shell acts as the title says, around the question whether something like a soul in which human hell lies, and about what happens when the answer is no.
negative;And an Oscar nomination?
positive;Tom has already been dumped, and Tom himself has already broken up.
negative;The large-scale actors stay to the big part behind their animation graffiti back.
positive;Absolutely impressive biography about an outstanding and unique human being.
positive;The acting achievements are an Oskar value.
negative;I'm pretty sure I'm not going to watch this movie again.
positive;So I can't understand the bad filmstarts.de rating.
positive;Very good acting performance and actions that result from the character and its past without affecting anything.
positive;In doing so, we not only get to know Bilbo Beutlin from a completely different side than the picture of the Bilbo engraved by Ian Holm conveys.
positive;But the praiseworthy thing about Stop Loss is without a doubt that they are current returnees.
negative;Many so many scenes to sacrifice to the cutting-ew?
positive;So go to the movies and watch this masterpiece.
positive;The film is consistently persevered, in style, in the archetype, in its complete drama.
positive;Highly recommended!
positive;All in all, a good movie with some little quirks.
positive;I'm very glad there are movies like this every now and then.
negative;Wouldn't Sid and Scrat with his cute *PIIIEP???
positive;The psychodual of the two main actors Pitt and Affleck is put into the scene.
positive;Nevertheless, it is recommended.
negative;Absolutely top-notch incensored, but the alleged political message and the twist at the conclusion celebrated in the film start criticism are so dishonest and inconsistent that it is an anger.
negative;I can only agree with the first criticism.
negative;Also in SeriÃ¶sen.
positive;The background story has finally developed again since part 2 and so, as they have made up all this, I am really jealous that all this is only fiction.
positive;"It's funny: during the Oscar ceremony, the film was passed over in the nomination for ""Best Effects"" because computer effects were not valid at the time.Conclusion: Simple but captivating story with unspeakably great effects for the then relationships â€ , a trendsetting evergeen!"
positive;new bond-touch?
positive;It makes him somehow more felt, since theoretically everyone could be an actor of the film (no matter which position) â€ , so I mean that the film is more to the heart.
positive;You can only recommend this movie to look at!!!
positive;I thought he was great!
negative;But at least pretty horny effects!
positive;The credibility of the film would have done well.
positive;Spoiler: Not Baker Streets 221B, but opposite Sherlock Holmes lives, no pipe,... etc.
positive;Kristanna Loken offers a solid performance and doesn't really do anything wrong, although of course she doesn't get to the performance of Robert Patrick as T 1000.
positive;"Greatly I fine the climbing and jumping passages of the hero based on ""[b]Parkour[/b]""."
negative;This isn't a Brad Pitt movie - if someone thought or wanted to see it.
positive;One of the most important motifs is art.
positive;And the final dialog with Batman - I also find very good and fits the content to the whole Batman epic.
positive;Keanu Reeves can't record it with current movie titans like Sean Penn or Edward Norton, but he's simply the coolness in person.
positive;The action is the best there ever was in a The Hard, there are again a lot of great noises from a McLane like you know him (except for the bald one is new) he is uncompromising and merciless with terrorists, he curses (I'm now more into the Recut in this regard) and is just cool and gorgeous old school.
positive;Thus, the whole episodey remains and individual scenes have no connection.
positive;I can only recommend it!
positive;Why does it always happen that good films are taken out of the program after 4 weeks?
positive;- Still a movie worth seeing.
positive;The movie is super funny, you're almost laughing!
positive;Over a side job she gets to poker rounds with particularly wealthy players.
positive;There are plenty of great action scenes to be seen, but you still have fun.
positive;In contrast to the book template, although somewhat distasteful, but given the fact that it is very difficult to film such successful books, the film is not so bad at all.
positive;But this masterpiece of music contributes much to the great atmosphere.
positive;That was the first time they thought he was gonna die.
positive;In absolute terms, Babel is a wonderful film with intense images and strong actors, which absolutely requires a popcorn-free seating series.
negative;"Conclusion: If you expect a funny comedy with ""Up In The Air"", only in the first half hour will be really well entertained, otherwise overall rather a love comedy with swarming story in the course of the movie."
positive;A little more time would have done the story quite well at the beginning.
positive;On the contrary, as a spectator, one can concentrate even better on the nuances of figure dynamics and dialogues.
positive;Once again Hanks proves that such figures are particularly good for him.
negative;How can people claim that this film is a masterpiece and how can you only broadcast this film on German television!
positive;And isn't it a good movie if I find the film interesting even without text?
negative;At least the close-ups could still be turned with food, but they were not.
positive;For example, my favorite place where he's gonna be in this camp before he became a Batman.
positive;P.S.
negative;Overall, a mixed story with funny acting actors.
positive;This movie is far more than unnecessary fakÃ¤lhumor.
positive;Of course, a movie can do without a big Hocus Pocus, but a bit more tempo and more haunting scenes would have been better for the overall impression.
negative;Thanks to computer technology, setting and effects are worth seeing.
positive;Generally there is a lot of heart in the film and Doris Dörrie managed to translate this fairy classic into the present without his charm being lost.
positive;From where shall he take them, for the doing of Belfort is superficial and irrelevant.
positive;The nakte-canone trilogy is by far the funniest thing I know about useless movies, there is still Helge Schneider competing with Leslie Nielsen, but he overdoes it a little, as I think.
positive;It's a fantastic movie!
positive;But this movie is still so much more than casual breakfasts and mountain hairstyles.
negative;But Idris Elba is really a positive point.
positive;We're used to the Coens by now.
positive;In addition, you still need a Böse in every movie, otherwise it would be boring.
negative;Attention, cult danger!
negative;But that's all positive.
negative;think of stupidity and can't win the least of it.
negative;A film is normal way to bet the viewer with great pictures---here unfortunately predictable and boring.
negative;by communicating with Satan or anything else, just made bad ---> But it's all just a matter of taste......
negative;Conclusion: Who stands on Jessica Alba should resort to Sin City...
positive;Nevertheless, it sometimes hurts to look and after all, the whole was held on entertaining 100 minutes.
positive;Thank God.
negative;Contra: - flattens off from half extreme - The actions and actions drift completely into the absurd and incredulous Spoiler: - What are you actually making in his spare time a de-scattering robot with machine gun and rocket launcher attachment?
positive;The characters remain naturally thin, but this is not a criticism point.
negative;"But we only get to know through a cut in the opening credits, how the ""brothers"" split up over the course of the long years and the experiences and have to accept it."
positive;Not even something special happens that would scare someone.
negative;P.S.: Did his childhood???
positive;The only downside from my side is clearly Sienna Miller - I'm sorry, but she remains pale and uninteresting in the tough role of Francesca so that you have to ask yourself as a spectator why Casanova is ensnaring this woman.
positive;The experiment is wonderfully played.
positive;Truly one of my favorite movies.
positive;I like the movie.
negative;"112 minutes â€"" hÃ1⁄4bsch colorful but not rousing."
positive;Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall stand out in further roles.
positive;You can say a lot about this movie but I don't want to spoil anyone's fun here, so just watch it!
negative;Especially the resolution is so bad that you can tell the movie in 10 minutes!
negative;A few small and great cases like the Chinese were there.
negative;But he's flattening out.
positive;Conclusion: All get in for the most bizarre trip of film history!
positive;A mosaic of short scenes is offered to you, which it is necessary to unlock.
positive;Also look damn good ^^ *Lenny pack, take it and eat it* And you others, Vanessa, Leon and the rest of the Wild guys, you've been so good!
negative;For me positive were the scenes with the taxi driver, which are waiting partly really funny and NoÃ©mie Lenoir was a feast for the eyes.
positive;Joe Wright has excellently translated Jane Austen's novel into pictures and created a contemporary version of it today.
positive;Then one day Lois Lane, who is wonderfully played by Amy Adams, enters his life.
positive;Every point of all that is possible.
positive;Those who expected a classic horror movie and get their hands on it.
positive;But after seeing the movie in the IMAX, I can only say two things: 1.
positive;He's just fine from 18 PUNKT!
positive;"I find it a pity that such class films are simply too little ""promoted"" and thus pass by the ""great mass""."
positive;The topic of breast cancer is brought to the viewer by the love of football excellently.
positive;The figure of Ilsa, who adores him (for whatever reason), is my personal low point, since she is not even ONE-dimensional, but flatter than a joke by Fips Assmussen.
positive;In addition, it was what some users have criticized that it is a lot about teen love, but that's just how it is to adapt the film to the target group, the young people.
negative;for also as a parody of himself.
positive;Now I have the DVD, and I can watch it as often as I want!
negative;Except for the last 20 minutes, you don't even notice that you're supposed to be dealing with a drama.
negative;The X-te remake of the eternal theme: â€œThe father of my best friendâ€œ.
positive;For all, whose heart is not made of stone, highly recommended.
positive;The whole situation in the bunker is kafkaesk.
positive;Excessive action, violence as the only means, fighting scenes where you have to laugh, because they are so beautiful old school and simply gorgeous.
positive;"Although you can't reach the class of an ""König der Löwen"" (""König der Löwen""), I don't think that's what I expected, especially since the film is dramatic and sad enough for an animated film."
positive;How may Gretel have felt??
positive;One realizes that Hugh Jackman has become old, but exactly suitable for this role as an old Logan.
positive;What's that supposed to mean??????
positive;This is not so much due to the action of the film, because it is quite manageable and rather forms a character study.
positive;Travolta chases De Niro through the woods!
positive;One is praised by the craftsmanship perfection and the great effects of the film.
positive;As a fan of the books I am really very surprised and look forward to the next part, which can hopefully approach this one!
positive;But so devastating?
positive;Nevertheless, effects fit, the characters are appropriately staged, even the new, humor is available enough.
positive;No, I'm done.
positive;What's hollywood next to BOLLYWOOD!!!
positive;Away from the good gags, some dialogues even approach a philosophical context.
negative;By showing a completely broken person, for whom one can show pity beside the mother, but no real sympathy?
negative;Visually, the film is interesting, however, smears the CGI at some places.
negative;It is also a good sash to have Tina Fey in the leading role, on top of that the movie tells a real case.
positive;"Also the fact that it is not ""Hollywood Glanzlicht-Produktion"" makes for me the film very likeable."
positive;A brilliant stroke of genius by Scorsese!
positive;==References====External links==
positive;Also Sheen plays sensational but at Langella is no passing possible.
positive;Anyone who knows how to watch this film with introductions and some psychoanalytic foreboding will see real horrors running over the back, because such a horror can hit anyone.
positive;No deep characters, no serious problems and no feeling.
positive;And isn't that what we old game fanatics wanted us to do?
positive;The dialogues of the script reinforce his performance perfectly.
positive;"He owns his record store, is dissatisfied, but not unlucky enough to really ""push down the Country A-C shelf"" and change his life."
positive;Acting, Jim Carrey is simply the perfect cast and also harmonizes really well with Ewan McGregor.
positive;the film is one of the best I've seen lately.
positive;Very episodic the Monthy Pythons this time pack their anarchic, brain-cracked potential in sketches around everyday events, naturally completely covered.
negative;Andrea Riseborough has a quite ungrateful part here and has from the beginning not the possibility to win the audience for itself and must cast the Buhmann.
positive;It is realistic and shows the use of weapons as it is: bloody!
negative;On the next day we looked again 10 min further and then finally gave up.
positive;90 minutes of adventure and two crazy protagonists.
positive;Over 40 years after his release, I saw the film for the first time and I'm gone!
positive;I went to the cinema with expectations to see an action cracker.
positive;Can only say one thing, grandios and if there are actually people who would not know such a masterpiece then I can only say that she is sorry.
negative;Actor and optical realism is lost.
positive;Rejoice me about everyone who discusses the film with me (no matter what age) :) MFG, Elina
positive;zaina (org) was a very well set in color, only because of the horses worth a cinema visit.
positive;I liked him, too.
positive;Despite studying no permanent job, just an internship.
positive;"Typical of Gibson, that we all know since ""Passion of Christ"", is that he places great emphasis on autism."
positive;Every prisoner in a society he despises in his innermost contempt.
negative;But love they do a savage, Fiery, not standesgemüße, which torments us to the edge of sadism.
positive;It's amazing.
positive;It's a hell of a cartoon!
positive;these scenes rub you with, like a wave, are shocking, but you can't look away.
positive;A portrait in the truest sense of the word.
negative;The script is really almost underground bad!
positive;I can't think of which one to compare with right now, but I enjoyed it anyway.
positive;I thought the movie was great, not boring at all!
positive;Everything shuffles and flickers so gently past one that it is made almost impossible for one to remember later on detailed maneuvers or camera settings, except for a few exceptions.
positive;A connoisseur is supposed to talk about the mastery, but the complete film is quite round and understandable for the unacquainted.
positive;It is only at the end that there is great reflection, and you see the film in a completely different light.
positive;It was precisely this effect that he obviously left with other people as well - he stimulates and up, all people who grumble and doubt, are nevertheless enthusiastic when values are questioned as to how it happens through this film.
positive;that's the logical sequence.
positive;"Because morality is also just a ""computerized"" product of the brain and a super machine has more computing power?.I've never seen these questions come up in a movie before."
positive;So who is a fan of Lindsay Lohan should definitely see this movie.
positive;No loose mouths.
positive;"I was caught on a leisurely ""healy world in which everything succeeds when friends stick together"" movie."
positive;There's nothing to complain about with the actors.
positive;In addition, I'm waiting for the right eyes.
positive;This movie, I think, can be recommended but absolutely also the one against it rather skeptical.
positive;Into the Wild is certainly not a film of a clear confrontation with the material and ethnic values of civilized society.
positive;"Anyway, ""E.T."""
negative;I have missed this, too, why does Caesar let his people go, even though he knows that the people are near and chase them?
positive;I have been a customer of a German Pay TV station for years on which this film was broadcast yesterday.
positive;The sensational, however, is how you sometimes catch yourself as you can understand the one or the other step which you do not want to have, however.
negative;At least better than nothing.
negative;And then the Death Star homes in on the Rebel Base - Umm, I mean the mining ship homes in on Starfleet headquarters, and only Luke Skywalker can stop it by ignoring orders and turning off his targeting computer and trusting the Force - no, I mean only Jim Kirk can stop it by ignoring Starfleet's orders and trusting his instincts.
positive;Indiana Jones is a saucooler hero, there are lots of drinks, funny and exciting moments, varied action that has not come into the years, great backdrops, one of the best soundtracks that ever existed and a magnificent cast.
positive;I am glad that there are still people who think similar about this movie like me (see Loki).
positive;Who would have thought that...: The movie is good!
positive;This provides for some cheese skin moments.
positive;After a win from six games comes what had to come: Clough's dismissal after 44 days.
negative;the ¶sewicht did not exist in the first aid of the film.
positive;and THE UNHEIMLY RELATED GISTER STUNDE (Creepshow) he can unquestionably fit in.... PS: In a just world (HAHA!)
negative;Sacrilege!
negative;Of course you can't expect from the film that it will be an absolute masterpiece but I would have expected a little more.
positive;Of course you may not always take the film too seriously, but it is absolutely entertaining and also offers great pictures of Norwegian and Swedish winter landscape.
negative;I'm surprised when Star Wars Ep.
positive;Guardians of the Galaxy is the funniest Marvel movie I've seen so far.
positive;Who stands on Transformers, battleship, Star Trek and similar, will like the movie.
positive;A little tears here a little there, in big and all just a great movie!
positive;"Above all, the story of the film is absolutely a ""Warcraft: Orcs and Humans""."
positive;Already been there, but still new.
positive;This is clearly based on special effects, the majority of which were created by the Australian VFX studio ESC.
negative;Moments snuck in on me.
positive;So fans, this movie was really amazing.
negative;The question arises again: did Hillary Swank have to pay a few bills?
positive;Hot movie!
negative;I don't think they're so outstanding now.
negative;Unfortunately, however, only on an average level.
positive;Simple and simple 5/5 points.
negative;";-) Enough for a DVD evening - cinema rather not"
negative;If the people really did this, tomorrow I would start to become trickers with them.
positive;I forgive only four stars.
positive;And because only one-eye has a travel plan, the trip goes to Walhalla.
positive;Forman develops a bulging image sheet of violence, with bonds on the history of Europe around 1800.
positive;If not now, when?
positive;"The actual ""star"" of the production is nevertheless director Julian Schnabel, whose merit in this successful work can hardly be denied."
positive;Parabolic are Flynn's words and not only for the moment when he speaks them to his church, but for him and the black-dressed shadow, who approaches him in the person of Sister Aloysius, who walks through the ranks and exhorts the disciples of St. Nicholas to pay attention.
positive;Overall great popcorn cinema in perfection.
negative;Unfortunately, this is also the only high point of the film.
positive;"I finally came to watch the movie ""21"", and what should I say, with relatively low expectations I went to the cinema, and was simply enthusiastic afterwards, which is of course thanks to the good actors, I admit, that the film particularly attracted me because of Jim Sturgess (finds the full snooze) which I found incredible since ""The Sister of the Queen"" in the beginning, also in ""21"" he delivered an excellent performance again, one takes off the role every second, and one can identify with his character properly and fevers with him especially towards the end, and Kate Bosworth also surprised me positively, actually I never liked it very much, but in this movie I really liked it, super sympathetic and listening to it."
positive;The movie was great... I'm even a little shocked at the moment how often *even by me* could be laughed, although everyone in the cinema *so I hope* knew what would happen if the bubble was in place...
positive;"Fun cinema so I can google the ""against the wall"" maker (I'm just too lazy to google the exact name - Faith Akin!?!!!)"
positive;"Jamie Foxx was great, even though in some cases he was only acting as a side character and not as a ""main opponent""."
positive;The actors wear this movie, no question.
negative;And also who I am referring to the music of the N.E.R.D.S.
positive;Wonderful to see an actress whose face presents lust and anger in completely different pictures than one has seen otherwise.
positive;"For this reason, ""The Girl Next Door"" is recommended."
positive;Oh also very beautiful is the unpredictableness of the film which otherwise often robs you of the lust and tension.
positive;Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) and Bloom (*sigh*: Adrien Brody) are two characters from the ground up: Already so early it is clear that Stephen holds the feather in his hand, picks out the planks and has the lead.
negative;I also noticed that all outdoor scenes look very much like studio, because the light mood (especially the passive light) just never fits.
positive;At the very end of the middle one can imagine almost nobody else in this role.
negative;==References====External links==
positive;"""Hacksaw Ridge"" plays however only in the second half really at the title-giving rock cliff, until then we get to know Desmond Doss in detail."
positive;Hanks shows in this film the most diverse facets of a human being, who at first still completely calmly reacts to the exceptional situation, in the end but then loses control over his own body and mind by the constant fear of death.
positive;The film captivates from the first to the last minute and the end of the film is absolutely unbeatable.
negative;"But so the film destroys its own message by pouring out in the form of a moral steam ram the ludicrous statement ""The good always wins"" over the heads of the spectators."
positive;Not so overly colorful and silly anymore.
negative;This may be because I had VERY high expectations of the film.
positive;This has been a real hit among the movies for a long time.
positive;What Chan here with his old age (with the film he was already 50) delivers to us for an action star cares of the more for an awe-inspiring astonishment.
positive;Is it green?
positive;"Because it's ""...the dead never sleep"" Samara lived at the time she was in Neola, however."
positive;Exciting from the beginning to the end.
negative;Humor is good to call, even if it could be a bit bit more biting here, but with a theme of the end of the world the whole thing should not degenerate into a full-blown comedy, so that you can no longer take up any threat, even though the aliens have not even appeared yet.
positive;Robin Williams is the perfect cast for the teacher John Keating, also Ethan Hawke young is interesting.
positive;There are always twists, which makes him even more interesting.
positive;"Although the director excellently understands how to guide the viewer with his ""Amelie"" memory optics around the nose at first."
positive;The supporting roles are a little weak, but Costner's rattles out very well.
positive;That's why a half-point deduction.
positive;"From the clothes in 'Glenn or Glenda' to the incredibly fake-looking squid in 'bride of the Monster' to the wrong cemetery in 'Plan 9 from outer Space'; all locations look real and look even better in black and white than they could ever have in color."
positive;The film is great cast, the story is very well implemented and fully compact with excitement and action where it belongs.
positive;a new technique, which - at least in my eyes - has earned nothing and is completely for the feet.
positive;bond itself follows the shot and meets as usual beautiful women who fall prey to his charm.
positive;What I suffered: the film came to the cinema in 1991, released from 16.
positive;Nevertheless, there is much to laugh and smile about.
positive;"""You look so beautiful"" - ""But only because I love you so much!"""
positive;This symbiosis of contradictory aspects is at the same time a new edition of the mentioned core points of all Kitano works.
positive;This film gave me too much insight and showed me how unique our life and the life of our children is.
positive;I was at Devil's late performance yesterday.
negative;Keira Knightley's weak performance in her hysterical attacks is the main drawback of the film.
negative;Soundtrack is accompanied by a French DJ who mastered his technique and accompanied the film throughout (no worries, there are others besides David Guetta).
negative;I got out of the movies early.
positive;"Only criterion point why I give the film only 9 points, because the story actually takes way too long for a ""normal audience""."
positive;The friendship that grows in the course of the film, seems equally credible and the artist finds through the hobby gardener exactly what he has been looking for there and why he has run away from the imagined and important Paris.
positive;A special plus also applies to the German synchronisation, for a long time I have not seen any synchro that is worth seeing (I think the last one was Cassablanca).
positive;Eyes Wide Shut I highly estimate its incalculability, which in my opinion comes about by an interesting genre mix: A romantic drama gradually becomes a thriller.
positive;Although the film finally got two Oscars in side categories (mostly right for the best scene picture and the best food), but due to the long time until the awarding the Kings categories seemed unattainable.
positive;"But with ""Coherence"" everything fits."
positive;The movie's really good.
positive;The use of hand cameras and hard cuts underline the immediacy of history.
positive;Hey, what's going on here???
positive;Also the look was really great, because the sanatorium had a great retro charm.
positive;On the contrary.
negative;perfect occupation: johnny depp, christian bale, marion cotillard.
positive;Every picture is extremely beautiful.
positive;Betti therefore disappears very quickly in the cube, i.e. in the realm of the dead.
positive;Conclusion: One of the best action riders at all!
positive;It's a really good movie.
positive;Take the pocket cups with you and let the film work on you!
negative;All of a sudden, he's rather amusing, and every spook has vanished.
negative;The A-Team is a thoroughbred actionr and should be considered as such.
negative;"Two funny guys torch her ""snack shop"" and they have to find a new job, so they come to the ""Fast Food Shop"" of Becky (Rosario Dawson)."
negative;The plot is (which is especially good for the younger viewers) good to understand.
positive;10/10
negative;The initial situation offers sufficient material for conflicts, drama and uncanny.
positive;"With ""The Untouchables"", director Brian de Palma has succeeded in making a really strong mafia thriller."
positive;soderbergh manages that one can objectively deal with the topic without being influenced too much.
positive;The music was great and simply fit very well into the atmosphere of the film.
negative;But the story that would like to surprise you, but doesn't do it, is so drawn into the distance that you want to, the cutter would have stoked something more here than the guy does in the movie.
positive;Nevertheless a movie you should look at yourself, also for not genre fans possibly a good tip.
positive;"""Thor 2 The Dark Kingdom"" is an action-packed fireworks that reminds of Hellboy 2 from his atmosphere."
negative;The film was not bad.I didn't like the language that you didn't like.
negative;But only here the film makes a big mistake.
negative;In Vanilly Sky, she is NOT portrayed as a pantomime and thus the stupid scene in which she stands silently and he waits in front of her in the rain is spared.
positive;There is actually no plot, the apparent concept of Italian mafia movies since Gomorrah or Suburra.
positive;What a movie.
positive;Unsurpassed!
positive;They could not learn from their previous experiences.
positive;cobie smulders and clark gregg as agent coulson were the little highlights, while tom hiddleston remained behind his possibilities.
positive;"In the center a simple story of one who falls and returns, in addition this was the time in which probably only a happy end can come in which the heroes are rich to the end (as in ""The secret of my success"")."
negative;First of all to the highlights: Super film shots, artisanal perfect film, good acting performance.
positive;Not exclusively suitable for football fans, but actually for anyone who wants to be taken with him by a true underdog story.
positive;In the new film he gets his nose in the picture here and there, but only to drive the story and the motivation of the main character forward, the focus is on Estevez's real father Martin Sheen who plays his daddy here as well.
positive;)Conclusion: Unsparingly brutal war drama in which it's more about the dramatic story than about the historical background - but still delivers exciting two and a half hours!
positive;Although I can quite understand the criticism of the many users here and although I myself have also noticed various bosses in the story and plot, I give the movie 4 stars.
positive;The story is understandable and yet gripping.
positive;Top characters!
positive;One is constantly fed with new information but thereby the voltage level is always kept at the top.
negative;You're about to die, I'd run away!
positive;I would like to mention, however, that I am a real Tron fan and therefore cannot be objective.
positive;You...
positive;But he impressed me.
negative;There were a few really funny punches in it, but towards the end it just gets catastrophically bad and boring.
positive;Absolutely nothing in this movie is overwhelming.
positive;Special praise to the film music, the skilful backdrop mix from the 50s and today, the outstanding Johanna W. (- which had impressed me as ILSE already in AIMEE & JAGUAR) and naturally the beautiful snug howl scene of still beautiful Til.
positive;"yes enough brain-cracked potential already in their own films have always contributed, since then also with their treacherous buddy „Apocalypse comedy enough slapstick, dialogue joke and insiderjokes fall off, the ""That's the end"" to make one of the funniest, though the worst, movies of the year."
positive;How the critic can only score 2 points here is absolutely creepy to me.
positive;With this criticism I would like to vehemently contradict Mr Friedrich K. in some points.
positive;Simon Pegg alias Scotty, is allowed to ride the best oneliners again, while Karl Urban can celebrate the sarcasm as pill Mc Coy again in full swings.
positive;The hopeless situations were maintained and the film scores even more with tension.
positive;"And finally you throw all these aspects into the balance, so ""The Holiday"" crystallizes out as a largely successful Christmas meal."
positive;And then you can only want to do the sound control of the horn device...
positive;He is daring, cheeky, evil, humorous....just everything!
negative;The story is very nice, but so embarrassing!
negative;That's just the question for me, how does it fit together?
positive;While the little girl is walking alone, she is discovered by a young name Haku.
positive;"Doing well ok, but making one on sanctity, no thank you... And exactly so many people are that just... Go off with it already that there is son blödes weibstück in der Gruppe is the rambo thousand times asks if he now helps, rambo says ""no you can anyway nothing changer goes to home"" and that happens 100 times... then at some point she makes him help, no clue why rambo suddenly helps, but some blöder sentence of the world better girl must have done that well... then go off, they meet on pirates on the way, they want to kill the world better girl old and all others and claustrate everything they have with them, quite obviously... rambo tries to prevent all this, but then sees only the chance simply to kill the pirates, what he also does... and then the nerves go off... the world better ones begin to rambo that only can do it again, and then the bad people deserve to say to themselves, and the bad ones"
positive;But that doesn't stop the movie either.
positive;However, especially the second third of the film is somewhat inappropriate.
positive;"David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" shows that even old films can still be very effective."
positive;I only played the game a bit and had to think sometimes why that and that is, but is it not exactly what you want to achieve with a movie?
positive;In this respect, the drama of the film consists primarily of the fact that the protagonist has to come to terms with the fact that his great love is an ice-cold murderer.
positive;But Downey Jr.
negative;this film is only boring despite all the action.
positive;Packing story.
positive;----------------------------------------------------------------- â€žMilkâ€œ portrays a situation full of distress, which must quickly give way to a contagious mood of departure.
negative;An unwarranted appearance to the 50 year old jubilee.Unfortunately the time 007 has caught up ...
positive;I don't have much to say about the movie, except that it's an absolute masterpiece that Pixar finds back to old strength and that it has become one of my absolute favorite movies, why?
positive;Played brilliantly!
positive;Conclusion: Go to the movies with your family.
negative;Shit, what I was looking forward to the movie and shit, how I'm disappointed.
positive;The music is perfectly integrated into the film and even the more modern HipHop-TÃ¶ne fit the Western (Southern)-Kulisse like the fist on the eye.
positive;So I feel a lot better than crash, really a masterpiece, which still remains for a long time.
positive;A good movie but not for everyone.
positive;All in all very well done, and also the tricks have become good.
positive;Above all, however, it is a character drama that, spiced up with mystery elements, results in an incredibly entertaining, exciting and profound film.
positive;Trump mostly overshadowed actress shows how fabulously wrong the POTUS lies also in this his inclusion.
positive;So whoever liked the first part will also be loved!
positive;"The symphony succeeded in what Chuck Berry succeeded with Johnny B. Goode, what Goethe achieved with his ""Faust"" - Kubrick managed with ""2001""."
positive;To make it short, best Spidey ever.
positive;In addition, I particularly like the first about 15 minutes of the film.
positive;I admit that the whole thing has become quite complex again, and n bit more Prometheus music in some places would have been good, but that's how you got on the 5th.
positive;I've rarely seen a better acting performance.
positive;Procedure and execution clearly resemble a pogrom, as it might have happened in Nazi Germany after the Reichstag fire.
positive;He has the same breathtaking excitement as the book.
positive;Deletion is one of the atmospheric sci-fi films of recent years, and Alex Garland uses this film to tap into his brilliant directing debut Ex_Machina.
positive;A surprising film by someone who you would hardly have trusted so much: Julie Delpy is a constant, regular supporting actress when once again a French lover o.ä.
positive;a clear line is drawn from the beginning to the end.
positive;The actors Law, F.W., Braga and Schreiber all good.
negative;(or did I get that wrong?)
positive;The production is perfect down to the smallest detail.
positive;You gotta get this straight!
positive;I'll give him 4.5 out of 5 stars.
positive;In the end, the trailer also promises nothing else.
positive;So now that I've read all the reviews, I want, yes, I have to write something about it.
positive;I hope in the two seven parts is once again trying to create the best to offer a worthy conclusion of the films.
positive;Throughout, the style and style of the film fluctuate between drama, thriller and tragedy, always offset by a pinch of bitter black humor.
negative;This is not even explained in the beginning, whereby it comes over like a hanger pulled on the hair for a bit of action in between.
positive;"I would therefore not like to go further into this grandiose work, except for a very specific, important detail, which is always too short as I mean: In Seven, another flawless masterpiece by Fincher, John Doe brings the meaningless sentence: ""They [people] are not able to understand it."""
positive;A good movie with great acting achievements
positive;Good actors, good action, good camera leadership, good dramatic scenes, thin story that is told but cuddly and straight.
positive;From the beginning, you can watch this film every cent of its 14 million dollar budget, like, for example, directly at Stromberg's Atlantis, which offers a great tasteful sight from both inside and outside.
negative;For this he receives all my contempt.
positive;A good killer is not only who shoots an opponent.
positive;There are many celebrities (including even Rihanna) to discover.
negative;From the book, I know she's protecting Snape.
negative;No, thank you.
positive;"No one would have thought that David Fincher could put another thriller on it after ""seven""."
positive;In a book about the films I had also read an important aspect about Indy's behavior against religion.
negative;the movie would have been saved.
positive;Less satire, more psycho study against a stark background, which strikes the brain as well as the stomach.
positive;For 9/10!
positive;It captivates with atmosphere and simple cans.
positive;The rest of the movie, in my opinion, is just awesome.
positive;"(Capa and Mace) Even the ""witnesses"", who reject certain actions that are necessary for the mission but which are humanly devious, are convincing in their presentation and arguments."
positive;The problem with bullying and the Internet and the social networks in place.
positive;It's important in this movie.
negative;You don't always have to see deep-rooted movies!
positive;It is best illustrated when he tells the anecdote from his childhood on the plane of his assistant, and after he saw the refugees in the Afghan camp, his sense of justice naturally came up again.
negative;"Nevertheless, the ""A-Team"" aims only to be stupid and deliver action."
positive;The pathos seem almost clichéd, because it is created by camera settings, music, dreary locations, as well as by the outstanding Willem Dafoe and Bruno Ganz, permanently and exsessively.
positive;Copley also puts on an impressive acting performance, far above the standard of the SprÃ1⁄4che exuding ballerheroes.
negative;A. Jolie in this role.
positive;Ash becomes the right sympathizer here.
negative;Medium movie.
positive;The whole Atmo is impressive and oppressive!
negative;"I have read Jodie Picoult's ""19 minutes"" and was thrilled, it is one of my favorite books."
negative;Because the boss is war hero and more surviving, he is naturally attractive as a partner for the woman in contrast to the humbling caretaker, which the subordinate suffers from.
positive;That is why I have 4 out of 5 points.
positive;10 points
positive;enough with exaggerations that the film was a fall and that it should only be released from 18.
positive;The film is an animated animation documentary I've never seen before.
positive;And as it belongs to the early Jackson is again properly flattened.
negative;The other weak point of the film is clearly the characters.
positive;The Chronicles of Narnia, Percy Jackson or even Twilight?
positive;The film begins rather calmly, is in the 1.
positive;A divine film monument that seeks its equal.
positive;"The film offers a breath-taking cut, and always changes the scene at the right moment, so that the individual ""episodes"" never merge into a unique, as often as I have seen it."
negative;"So far, I only saw ""12 years a slave"" from Steve McQueen, which inspired me, and I was prompted to watch his movie ""Shame"", often referred to as a masterpiece."
positive;3.
positive;(15.02.2011) - Addition: some one seems to go to the cinema with false expectations.
positive;Atmosphericly dense film, maybe something too much loaded with psychological clichés.
positive;But Imelda Staunton has played her so convincingly nasty and intensely that I have really taken this role from her.
positive;But that's not what he says on the packaging.
negative;completely brain-free parachute scenes(End: Shockwave fights against parachute?!?!)
positive;"I didn't know before that it was the pre-film of ""Jay and Silent Bob beat back"" so to speak."
negative;The first pictures of the film â€žNocturnal Animalsâ€ show heavily overweight Burlesque dancers, who let their arms and legs stroll and weigh in circles.
negative;I didn't pick the movie, I saw it (unfortunately) in a sneak preview.
negative;Unfortunately, I can't say that from the movie he's the worst of the previous 6.
positive;Matrix, Spider-Man...
negative;A spinoff without Matt Damon follows, for this with Jeremy Renner, who, however, delivered rather meager play results in Germany.
positive;Ignorants who do not want to see his success story and who do not understand the magic of this film must and will always exist.
positive;The acting performance of August Diehl as Karl Koch, who is becoming paranoid, is particularly noteworthy.
negative;Although the acting performance of the main actors was good, especially that of the mother, nevertheless this film has disenchanted me.
positive;This is then additionally accompanied by the magnificent soundtrack, which really goes under the skin and in connection with the pictures can draw a wonderful picture.
positive;Above all, this apocalyptic, pale and black-and-white landscape has surprised me, which never loses its attractiveness due to ever-colored views such as Aerith's flowerbed or Vincent's cape.
positive;Much better than the Never Back Down teen MMA tweezers and so far the best movie with MMA background.
negative;[...]Where the â€œAlienâ€œ series managed to transport variables into a concept that is hardly less rigid by itself through changing basic moods and settings, â€œPredator 2â€œ also wants to achieve this through scene, story and characters, but as stubbornly as the creature pursues its prey, so little does the brimborium fit around them, so little does it affect them and so little does it change them in any original direction.
positive;9/10 points, since it was also a bit too kitschy for me in places.^^ But that's what I think is a matter of taste.
positive;Despite the difficult topic, the presentation of the actions always remains credible.
negative;But this is not what I find fascinating at the cinema and what makes the strength of the cinema.
negative;Like its protagonists in the film, director DAVID ROUNTREE also wants to celebrate successes and make quick money with only simple means and sales-promoting topic.
negative;So we have an action movie with Jason Statham in which the action is missing and Statham is an absolute misoccupation.
positive;Ã¢ÂžLord of the Rings, for example, belongs to the best trilogy for me, but certainly does not claim to be historical.
negative;The actors: almost consistently good, unfortunately I find Matt Damon extremely misoccupied.
positive;Anyone who is exclusively interested in pure action and fascinating images of science fiction will not like Interstallar.
positive;ðŸ the-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative;Unfortunately, this film is not positive.
positive;But as soon as the high point takes place (the demise of Candie), the film somehow loses its air.
negative;Unless you also enjoy a tax check or root canal treatment at the dentist.
negative;Especially I'm sure that everyone is a little biased about the role of Jim Carey, he plays a very different genre, as you know, and I didn't think the role was right for him at all.
positive;"The movie ""Emmas Glück"" has something."
negative;5.
positive;For the latter, however, it is a wonderful children's film with everything that is important for the little ones.
positive;The length is indispensable since they initiate the increasing sinking into the psyche of the figure.
positive;A great movie with an incredible encounter with a bear.
positive;He places a task in which the main character tries.
positive;There are always frightening moments and shocking scenes, which let the spectator directly participate in the all-embracing fear, which gets above all Robyn to feel, without blood splatter and similar cruelties.
positive;As the only real point of criticism I see that Zuckerberg's character does not take a big development, one would have to immerse even more in it.
positive;In fact, 4 outstanding directors have shot 4 outstanding films and this is something very special in the film world.
positive;I love the second as well as the first part I'm still creeping up today.
positive;Conclusion: Great drama full of power and emotions with grandiose actors, tragic moments and strange ending!
positive;Now I bought it aif DVD and another little tip: Watch the film best in English.
positive;Although it is sometimes difficult to look through all the nestings, but somehow it doesn't matter during the viewing.
positive;All around, absurd things happen and you are drawn into a world full of surreal characters.
positive;And smiles in the consciousness that this will be his most beautiful murder.
positive;Those who eat there often should look at the movie in any case.
positive;In fact, in many points the film is so damn honest and realistic that you don't really want to see it.
positive;==References====External links==
positive;Whether it needs to be four Oscars now - I don't know so well.
positive;The bestseller list must have passed on to me.
negative;To be honest, I found the film a little too boring and lengthy.
positive;Then this great movie can captivate and make thoughtful.
positive;And that's so incredibly bad at times, that it's really great and fabulous again.
positive;It's terrible to watch passengers call their parents/friends and say goodbye.
positive;It's a good disaster film.
positive;The story is implemented so early and yet humorous and funny, but remains serious.
positive;Meanwhile, I've seen the movie 17 times.
positive;"May or in the original ""Still Life"" is not a Hollywood cinema, but a wonderful movie with many small remarkable and also - despite the morbid theme - funny scenes."
positive;*ACTION* The circling hips at the dance scenes??
positive;For me, the scene where Pacino and de Niro sit in a cafÃ© is a high point of film history.
positive;"You're alone, all alone... what would you do?"""
positive;Before.
positive;And even more so the normal cinemagoer - 5 stars!
positive;Just by the excellent 3D effect you are drawn into the world of the hugo cabret.
positive;Absolutely recommended!
negative;But it's going to be even crazier!
positive;I find everything that has to do with harra potter cool where it really is true that the books are better than the movie.
positive;The dance scene in the ABspan is naturally due to Bollywood, but rather makes the impression of warming up when compared with similar Hindi or Tamil dance scenes.
positive;How pure and peaceful a child's soul can be.
positive;In most children-oriented animation films it is about friendship and trust, a much more adult topic is mentioned here.
positive;"But friends of movies like ""JFK"", ""ZODIAC"" is highly recommended."
positive;I don't have any criticism.
positive;But ultimately everything is connected, in this case classic Hollywood action cinema with really new and innovative ideas.
positive;The actors are in my opinion perfectly selected and also the story captivates immensely.
negative;I find Oliver Stone should have directed, in JFK he also so beautiful with the wooden hammer into the delicate topic.
positive;In my opinion, you just have to love Kick Ass!
positive;Her neighbor Paul is a destitute writer and doesn't fit into her prey grid.
negative;There's no sign of breath!
positive;Partially grandiosely staged, especially the scenes with Lupita Nyong'o (who got an Oscar nomination perfectly right) are so intense that your hair is on the rise.
positive;The cinema viewer can only guess the unique DÃ1⁄4fte and its effect on the people, which SÃ1⁄4skind once described and illustrated so exuberantly.
positive;The film was very entertaining and humorous.
positive;Very demanding, not easy to look at, most shocking, but equally impressive by editing, sound and actor performance.
positive;How do you see and die?
positive;: Jake Gyllenhaal in his best role since Donnie Darko.
negative;I had hoped for more.
positive;In prinziep, nothing has been done but to cut something out of the first part.
negative;"In the end, you ask yourself the question that you would never like to ask: ""...and that's it now??"""
positive;I like the movie, it's action loaded and sometimes a joke is made.
positive;That alone wouldn't be bad if such films and their protagonists could not come along with a social and social-critical claim, especially Grass, who could not refuse to demonstrate in the film how well he understands himself with Gerhard Schröder: Kissing here, a bussi there.
negative;And it is also guaranteed not a movie to amuse itself about our western neighbours.
positive;On board the plane there are four terrorists who take over the cockpit and stab a passenger, the two pilots and a stewardess.
positive;Think average people won't be able to do anything with this movie, but you just have to be open and not mental for such a movie.
negative;...I don't know what the others who saw the movie so well, the Sherlock Holmes we saw was terribly boring, low tension and not worth going to the movies.
positive;If even millions of cities like Miami need to increase their roads for many millions of dollars, in order not to become a victim of floods caused by the rise of sea level, then one attacks oneself to the head, if little later from the official side is vehemently claimed that climate change is an infamous lie, which is to harm the economy.
positive;Watching the film in German is only recommended here!
positive;Joe plays along is good old Bruce Willis.
positive;2 - Cinematography - close ups and landscapes, a wonderful job of contrasts.
positive;Especially when I was allowed to admire the great performers (including Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close) at your partly amusing game!
positive;The end is different from what you thought.
positive;All this is served with a great staging.
positive;The movie just makes fun!
positive;Gänsehaut pure and I really let a few tears roll!
positive;Whether a heart really suffices to appease the conflict between the rulers and the workers is questionable - yet the dystopian vision of the future is thus far groundbreaking.
negative;This new filmic storm front has nothing to do with the film, yet similarities can hardly be avoided.
positive;After that the family is introduced and a little time is taken.
positive;"""Snatch"", that is a true diamond, around which the whole older is really worth it!"
positive;I am a confessing fan of films that radiate an uncanny atmosphere without letting Vlut fly.
positive;I'm really pretty excited about the movie, because I just find the topic exciting.
positive;The film offers great underwater shots, even if the introduction sequence of the film, was not yet quite convincing for me, the later film history is an absolute hit.
positive;All around Ghost in the Shell is a very captivating action film with an outstanding Scarlett Johansson and a great story, with small dicks in the story and the choice of the show spots, as well as in the tension arc.
positive;If not, even the BEST ANIMATION FILM!!!
positive;Discussions that are filtered exclusively according to the usefulness of information that could give you an advantage somewhere next.
positive;The story is snappy and shows the life of the American small town family so realistic that you are already sorry.
positive;Wouldn't everyone know, right?
negative;"Not bad for the spectator, but hard for Meg Ryan - no one wants to see her in her standard role anymore!Conclusion: Routine love comedy with original time travel background and a charming Hugh Jackman â€"" overall but only average!"
positive;The right mixture of Star Wars, Western and the fantasy worlds of Myst (computer game).
positive;The acting performance of the actors is flawless.
positive;This film is undoubtedly the best of the year.
positive;So if you expect a movie with a lot of action, you will be disappointed here.
positive;You have to have seen it and you can look in more than 1x.
positive;This movie gets 5 stars from me!
positive;It creates the balancing act between reactive avenging angel and the empathetic awareness of the criminality of one's own actions.
negative;Since Mrs. Rowling simply no longer wanted to chase her magic apprentice through Hogwarts forever, one end of the film series was to be seen.
positive;It's just an end to thinking.
positive;It takes a long, good 70 minutes until the super monkey appears for the first time in general - before that the film takes a lot of time to present its characters very long and wide and also to draw a careful portrait of New York and the economic crisis 1933.
negative;The actors remain too pale in front of this backdrop, too little captures Vinterberg's true-to-work filming the inner tension of the template between self-realization, love and suffering.
positive;And everyone who goes into such a movie, must know what he gets himself into.
positive;Simply fascinating, large cinema!
positive;In my opinion: one of the best movies lately!
positive;The tower I also liked very much and the beautiful long hair of Rapunzel.
positive;"only when you leave the cinema it becomes clear to you what universal topics were actually addressed here; the role of the woman, social conflicts and their consequences, desperation and rage, injustice and, most loudly, the inexhaustible call for freedom."
negative;Hello to all Cineasten, the movie Souls has managed to leave the cinema after about 70 minutes.
positive;I'm excited about this horror movie!
positive;Especially Robert Stadlober as Haruo (*gg*) I can only recommend the film to anyone who doesn't want anime.
negative;The 3D is not used in this movie at all meaningfully.
positive;"From ""Donnie Darko"" I have heard again and again without knowing much about what a movie is."
negative;Admittedly, I already made big eyes when I mostly stood on above average good statements to match point.
negative;If he's better, I'm not quite sure yet.
negative;You explain then also the corresponding errors, however it has actually ruined everything and it still remains the incredible component.
positive;Voicey and well staged blockbuster entertainment!
negative;Plus.
positive;He has a lot of humor, is exciting and has a lot of action.
negative;The movie is late.
positive;The film is very well staged and is not overstated brutally.
negative;I'm gonna build up my review chronologically.
positive;"After reading Asimov's short story ""Der Zweihunderjährige"" and later learning that she was filmed (with Robin Williams), I was already very excited about the film."
positive;Not necessarily what for small children but nevertheless great.
positive;Very good movie!
negative;"In District 9 such a logic does not exist: The ""scientists"" who examine the semi-debtable protagonist after his accident seem to be mentally moving at about his level, because their faces are completely unprotected."
negative;In â€œDate Nightâ€ , now tries â€œ30 Rockâ€ , star Tina Fey, exactly us her serial colleague Tracy Morgan (Cop Out), her first steps on the big screen.
positive;The slogan is: to go in, to laugh at each other and have a lot of fucking fun!
positive;!The absolute dream man.All those who like to watch love-snucks and Jude Law find themselves good should look at the film in any case!
positive;BB = Brad Pitt runs and lives against time until he dies internally about 83-year-old and externally as a sucker.
positive;Conclusion: The film makes fun and pays the cinema visit not only for children, but also for adults.
positive;An insanity, as this film manages to create tension.
positive;Also the early scene of the Viennese Red Light Milieu comes rather calm and unspectacular: No stress, good entertainment with an appealing acting performance.
positive;It's an absolutely worth seeing movie.
positive;Sometimes video messages of his bosses and his family reach him - due to a defect in the radio system however direct contacts are not possible.
positive;The script is brilliant, even if in 2 points the weak points of the film can be found: 1.: Was the short appearance of the old woman in the form nötig ?
negative;They've never seen her again.
positive;In this respect, I would also like to emphasize that, unlike the novel, the film brings the various stories in a much greater harmony, although some of the changes to the novel are enormous.
negative;I saw the movie yesterday in the sneak preview and must say I was very disappointed.
positive;Have fun!
positive;Not a movie like any other and absolutely recommended!
negative;Who anyway places no value on a (necessary) action will know the film to protect, all the others will probably be unscathed.
positive;"Hugh Grant plays exactly against his image as a slimy scumbag, and Colin Firth is simply a powerful heart-good, stiff Brit.Conclusion: Cute little comedy with loving characters â€"" no more or less!"
positive;But they weren't that silly.
positive;==References====External links==
negative;he marries all and thinks even 3 steps ahead.
positive;and to miss the film a worse rating just because the end aprut and unexpected comes is absurd - the film manages to entertain over the entire course of almost 2 hours in advance, since the end does not play a role - death proof is a masterpiece and does not need to hide any way behind other tarantino productions
positive;The story is about John Wick... who, pretty pissed off, is hunting the Russian mafia because they took away the last thing he had left and this was very dear to him.
negative;However, it is said to have been actually simply its kind.
positive;"His last scene brings his entire acting career from his fears to this day ""full circle"" to the point that you can really hold your breath."
positive;Well, you all know the rest, so I'd rather go to the other critics.
positive;Hope it doesn't drift in that direction.
positive;has become an excellent thriller, which knows to score above all by its unusual atmosphere.
negative;The main actor is absolutely colourless anyway, Binoche is also amazing colourless.
positive;I can recommend this movie to everyone because a story is not so important and he just has a bock on a budget.
positive;Matching his lifestyle, he also gets to know his queen, who is played by Margott Robbie.
positive;surpasses any kind of zombie movies that existed before in every respect!
negative;'Skyfall's excess weight pushes forward and has no time for situation or person.
negative;Probably my opinion would be better if it had not given at the end a view of a 2nd part.
positive;Thanks for this movie.
positive;Great cinema with a grandiose cast and very convincing masks.
positive;The animation team has done incredible things and gave the film a large amount of epic and imposance through oily-artic backgrounds.
positive;One could have told the story even louder.
positive;Interesting entertaining entertainment.
negative;Minister of Culture Hemf (Thomas Thieme) wants the author Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch) to be able to get him out of the way and then his friend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).
negative;As a result, the film became too sadly pathetic, this whole message â€žman has only to believeâ€œ and the stupid ending have significantly damaged the film.
positive;Step up is the best movie I've ever seen!!!
positive;The story is very simple and the storyline is predictable, but this is not supposed to be a shortcoming in this film.
positive;In this miracle with Elvis, True Love, bad guys, comics, kung fu movies, dialogues about the reproduction of African Moors and why you better not equate them with Sicilians, drug deals, corkscrews, and incredible bad designer sunglasses... everyone should actually find something for his Gusto.
positive;The film travels along, leads and is not boring at any time.
positive;Out of pity for him alone, I have to find this movie good, but also because I still laugh at my ass today.Conclusion: Unrivalled gagspektacle with high witty density and after today's days incredibly â€œ humor
positive;First and foremost, he has succeeded in a powerful parable about human society and its creations.
positive;A very moving film.
positive;For every movie fan only highly recommended!
negative;"If I ever get my hands on the cameraman of this movie, I'll probably turn his neck around (do not take it literally ;) )..."
positive;Nothing like that.
positive;super played and you just hope in the movie that it all works out like the 'crew' (so I don't mean the film team) hopes!
positive;Too bad that there is no continuation of this part yet.
positive;The second half is getting better - it is again reference there, no hacked off different scenarios, it results again an overall picture, in which also finally tension, emotions and drama come back to bear, as it should be and as I would have wished from the beginning.
negative;In addition, the acting performance was fine, and some scenes have really tied up for a short time.
positive;Don't do anything.
negative;Nevertheless: for each whose age is double digits the title should be a single torture and also remain without corresponding success.
negative;"The film is almost ""only"" a pure effect noise."
negative;5 out of 10.
positive;I would personally reinstate for the style alone.
positive;Surrounded by injustice, resentment and rejection, both in school and in the family, the two build their own home in a treetop in the forest on the other side of the river.
positive;Unbelievable, this movie won't let you go after watching!
positive;The action also gets a not so weighty role.
negative;Tim RothsÂ ́ game works in all of this (especially in the game).
positive;Cinema - for this (these) movies are made The film really supports you.
positive;"Next to ""A universe in my head"" is a Polish film you should have seen."
positive;By the way, Sebastian StrÃ¶bel is easy to join and a good actor, just like Felicita's wool.
negative;It's a boring movie.
positive;Why should the film be like the Lord of the Rings?
positive;"with no movie in 2008 I felt so well entertained (except ""TDK"" but that's something else)."
negative;But if there were only these small mistakes, we would not have to worry.
positive;"for example at the soudtrack, which on some places sounds similar to a piece of the great morricone, which has invented some score-hammer of the spaghetti western - one see and hear ""play the song of death"" (10/10)."
positive;What I personally found at the beginning somewhat desirable is that the main actors (Spirit and the other horses) did not really speak (out of spirit as archaeologists) but only have how.
positive;This film is a feature film and not a documentary.
negative;This interference probably went so far that Fincher even wanted to distance himself from the film.
positive;So Iron Man is now dependent on the help of his friends and old guides for the rescue of his girlfriend.
negative;Bad enough that it's close to reality, these guys are so inconceivably stupid and dull that I just think of it....
positive;That's awesome.
positive;But the movie itself is a real drama, possibly also TragikomÃ¶die but I actually go too far the term.
positive;"one could say who full metal jackets ""liked"" will also like jarhead."
positive;Nevertheless, Terminator scores high speed with good action sequences, an unusual new Terminator and a very good Arnold Schwarzenegger worth seeing!
negative;But it gets even better: Dreymann gets a visit from a journalist from the West to release Dreymann's text.
positive;"Finally some real action ;) But somehow the title doesn't fit the movie!"
positive;Nevertheless, I have a lot to do.
negative;)But you have to be fair in two points: on the one hand, the original version of the film was a good 3 hours long, so it will probably have fallen victim to a lot of explainative and in-depth scissors, on the other hand, director Stuart Baird may not be a â€žStar Trekâ€œ director, but he understands from action what â€TM and the entire film has been excellently staged from the effects and especially in the action-packed last half hour.Despite that: it would have been possible to say a nice goodbye to this crew!Conclusion: Crafted, but content-packed science fiction thriller, which lacks the charm of its predecessors!
positive;This has been the directorial office of Ben Affleck.
negative;I haven't heard an inappropriate selection of music according to the scenes and the theme for a long time.
positive;The story of a young man, who, in the sighting of his murdered aunt's ill-contaminated home, gets to know this (apparently)unknown woman StÃ1⁄4ck for StÃ1⁄4ck and also draws inspiration from these memories for his own life, is a wonderfully unobtrusive anthem to the - at first sight seemingly - unlived life of a human being.
positive;"In addition to a successful production of Mike Newell, ""Donnie Brasco"" can score above all through convincing acting achievements."
negative;Still... where there was to be an end, there was no end.
positive;Right in front of me, I love this movie!
negative;With everything standing head we already had one of the best animation films of all time and now of course the question stood immediately in the room, whether one could with Arlo & Spot (once again a completely daemonous German title) this gigantic quality again open up?
positive;Bane is a lover driven by love, who describes himself as the necessary body, whereas the Joker is to be seen rather than the absolute body, which has no motives and motivation for its action.
negative;Those who want to get into it*** are right here.
negative;In many scenes you can see cheap computer effects (e.g.
positive;The unresolved murders worry the public as acts of the â€ ¬Tarotkarten-Killerâ€.
positive;"The plot does not, of course, reinvent the genre at the first moment, is almost already ""the great number"": a young man experiences that he has cancer and then throws his world out of the lashes, the people in his environment must prove appropriate to the new situation and bring to light surprising behaviors - in both the good and the negative."
positive;Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio convinced me in the same way.
positive;Right at the beginning, the director shows us in which direction the film will go.
positive;Against these two figures, the manipulative, more complex Evie in the course of the film is somewhat in the background.
positive;A beautiful movie that knows how to please.
positive;Right â€ , you do your best and above all, you're safe.
positive;In advance: I'm not a fan of the Coen brothers.
positive;Well, he's got more women looking at him.
positive;The boy and summer set run along the street.
positive;Unusual evil soft, unusual frame and very strange action.
negative;Mr.Burton would have been able to play with colors and to increase it to the extreme, we finally find ourselves in Wonderland.The film also looks more bad in 3D than right.For me clearly one of the weakest performances of Tim Burton.
positive;Ana's joie de vivre is contagious, but always provided with a touch of grief.
positive;Conclusion: Strange, hard-to-see drama from Greece.
negative;Just laughable.
positive;In addition to him, the further four friends are very authentic and funny after possible desire, that one suspects that Wright would have just filled off his protagonists and then kept the camera on it.
positive;but exactly in it lies also the charm and joke: so bold types there really are.
positive;And what is the message???
positive;The 2017 sequel can come after this grand new beginning.
positive;Although I'm not a friend of horror movies, he tied me up very much.
negative;Shootout at its... most uninspired.
positive;Especially the older actors: great!
negative;If all reflections are sooo dangerous, why is no one afraid of the shiny car body?
positive;The film is very well chosen by the location and reminds of a computer game.
positive;Yes, because the culture-clash bonds there give way to a very special humor, which is also used once again in one of the latter scenes.
positive;Now to the film content: Since I already read the book several years ago, I didn't know quite as well about the actual story.
negative;I'd rather look at Armageddon for the third time :) CIAO!
positive;The free world does not come around the balancing act, to fight religious fascism and other totalitarian ideologies by all means, but at the same time to respect the personality rights of their citizens.
positive;Mark Strong has relatively little screen time as Lord Blackwood and if he is to be seen, then mostly dreary looking.
negative;Promisingly failed he screams his cover-up and anger over his insecurity to the evil Pentagon conspirators in the face.
positive;And of course: for me as a fan the strengths prevail in the totality of the Middle-earth hexalogy.
positive;Top also the media that the two Life implemented in real life a few days ago.
negative;But actually, she didn't play badly.
positive;This film manages to captivate the viewer to see what soldiers have been doing there.
positive;It's funny that he didn't stir up dust anymore, and was rather poorly received in the cinema.
negative;The worst thing about the movie was, unfortunately, Nicole Kidman.
negative;The film is predictable & clearly intended for children.
positive;I loved the scene where the two of them fight in the house until almost death strike and then they still get up against each other and passionately get to know each other.
negative;The film tries to incorporate a lot of feelings and showed offsets from Findet Nemo, but did not convince for a long time as this one.
positive;The film is pure entertainment and simply fun.
positive;I guess it's a fad and today's youth just doesn't have a sense of beautiful melodies, but my friend thinks it's the money that nobody wants to spend on good composers anymore.
positive;Definitely worth it!
positive;With the opponents of the Man of Steel, a real brutal figure has been brought into play.
positive;The slow pace should not irritate.
positive;It is the best world war film of today, which you should definitely not miss.
positive;This scene reminds me of horror movies from Japan, South Korea, etc.
positive;Professionally, I work with aggresive-violent children and young people and am thinking about whether I present this film to them, however, this idea has to drop because of the age limitation.
negative;The film nevertheless offers a great starting position, the first viewing angle scene is fulminant and adjusts a hopeful to the coming specific explanation points of the entrance scene.
negative;2.
negative;What else can I say what I haven't been told?
positive;He's blowing you through.
positive;What they could definitely have done better was the humor.
positive;"Larry Clark reflects the reality as it is in this brilliant film, but most people unfortunately don't see this ""reality"" in real life."
positive;It is a cheekiness to attract small children and whole families over the television advertising with completely false expectations in the movie.
negative;If the situation comedy is as funny as when I fall from a high-rise building and I was happy to stay on a nail with my eye, I realize that the script really doesn't come up with a single innovative idea.
negative;Chic packaging with very ambivalent content: clearly it is cool to see how Charlize Theron boots through the re-enacted Berlin, and everyone who comes to her blöd is spoilt, however, this is not the central point of the film.
positive;In the movie the exact opposite happens, he gets older until he finally dies.
negative;Probably didn't get a better movie that year.
positive;More of it, please!
positive;Look pays off if you want to experience epic effects.
positive;A film that focuses on the important things of life.
negative;At last, the four girlfriends not only seemed like four perennial pecks, but got character-like depth (no fear - Ingmar Bergman level was not really reached).
positive;First of all, I would like to answer the question that everyone who hasn't been to the cinema has asked themselves: Is the film a masterpiece?
positive;Ok...10/10 points I can't give the film just a certain amount because it just didn't correspond to what... which makes for plus points for the first time is of course the regie-wunderking tarantino... also the actors do their work well... which is also good added the soundtrack from a collection of different unfortunately... from the tension build up the film is not so intoxicating now.. but the action is so great... the heavy fights are very well represented... also the change of the black-and-white picture is a good idea... whether kill bill for anyone you what is because I'm not ... at least the FSK 18 is justified... because the film is very brutal... minus points there are here and there are a few small angels but that's it...
negative;That I finally give this movie two stars owes it to the excellent actors, who could not pull out the weak script anymore.
positive;Giant Compliment to Young Actors Madison Wolfe !!!
negative;But as a Bond fan, it was a mandatory program.
positive;Breathtakingly after my opinion!
positive;The drama around Albert is indicated in some scenes, the torments he had to endure as a child, the cold of his parents' home, all this is weighed so lightly and elegantly in the movie and above all, without great drama.
positive;Robert Downey was properly nominated for the Oskar.
positive;Australia really offers something to everyone, joke, charm, drama and action, nothing comes short, everything fits together, the actors act excellently together, somehow everything just fits and the whole plays then before one of the breath-taking scenes that you can think of, these are simply wonderfully set in scene and you feel as if you were on site.
negative;Humor goes swimming.
negative;Is Michael Meyers such an angry figure because we don't know exactly why he's like him?
positive;==References==
positive;The invented elements provide for cheerfulness, due to the drama of this season 1976 and the special characters Lauda and Hunt the reality was better than any invented racing films.
positive;Her husband John (Alec Baldwin) and her family try to help her in this situation, but over time they push her to her limits.
negative;I think we have watched the exciting games all at home on the TV, a movie would not have been necessary at all.
positive;I can't wait when the new DVD comes out!
positive;So what?
positive;Who is to inspire for such something is rewarded with a fantastic film experience.
negative;The only question remains what is worse: the exaggerated action, in which the viewer can no longer identify who causes which building to collapse or the terrible script, by showing the actions of the two heroes far away and not comprehensible (SPOILER e.g.: worst the scene in which Batman Superman wants to kill, however, he decides against it after he only hates the whole movie, because their two mothers have the same first name?
positive;Here the â€œShaky-Camâ€ for fast trips through the forest, which became famous by the original, was not dispensed with.
negative;The second antagonist is the gigantic octopus, which is almost never seen in whole, whose invincibility is so obvious early that the tension at the end is in bad limits.
negative;It doesn't have to be the overwhelming patriotic US and A that the war is only black and white but please gentlemen...some more love and emotion it can be then already.
negative;"High point here is the sign with the ""No dogs."
negative;"There are movies that you've already seen when you just watch the trailer â€"" this is one of them."
positive;Great movie!
positive;The presentation, the style, the stories, the abstruse, the brutality, the actors, the action....just everything.
positive;"The second problem is that the German version is not available as a single DVD, but only in the ""Scream 1-3 Special Edition"" 4 DVD Box which, because it contains Scream 1 in the uncut version, is also indicated."
positive;I just looked at Peter Jackson's masterpiece King Kong the other day, and I've been quite satisfied.
positive;"But then you really need someone to talk about... from me standing ovations... ...and a lot of ""good nerves"" to all who will still see him!"
negative;The next ones are the explosive charges.
positive;This is an aspect that the film allows to shine through again and again.
positive;A praise to camera and cut!
positive;You really feel the fight for survival.
positive;For me personally the best movie of the year 2016 by far.
negative;Back in his residential district, he dedicates himself to an old man drawn by the Holocaust, chauffeuring him for nothing.
positive;Tranches of service in view of the many enchanting moments, and tears of anger in view of the cruelty, with which people who were other were treated at that time.
positive;The MÃ©nage Ãtrois and homoerotic scenes between Neve Campbell and Denise Richards never seem vulgar, but just tingling and especially Denise Richards ('Starship Troopers') carries the erotic ambience almost on its own.
positive;I just can't understand why so many people call this movie bad or boring.
positive;"Since neither Claude's ""encouraging sermon"" about the hippopotamus, nor the embarrassed colleagues help him, he lets himself be persuaded by his buddy Sandy to go to a party, at which he then meets an old schoolmate - Polly (Jennifer Aniston) - who waits there (i.e. one should actually say, the CONSUMER, to wait)."
positive;Thus one gets to know the small, willing witch very well and also includes it in his heart.
positive;I'm actually getting pretty hard to laugh at, but the movie really has it in itself!
negative;Ghost Movie 2 similar to his predecessor... he has good gags in it, but sometimes this movie is quite nice and the story in itself I also did not like!
positive;"The director Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"") took 5 years to make a new film, the time to wait for his latest prank was worth it."
negative;A cure for wellness.
positive;The last flowers give one in the innermost.
positive;The monkeys are fantastically animated the story is incredibly captivating and you could take the whole action wake up here and it would still be an incredible awesome movie!
positive;This is an inconceivable sign, with which a new Nolan film is confronted with an immensity of expectation: Is the film now â€žzeitlos geilâ€œ, or is it just â€œa bit timeless geilâ€?
positive;The staging is mostly quiet, it takes time for the characters and also the horror takes up only slowly on drive.
negative;But so the whole construct, the brisant figure constellation, was built up, which caused tension.
positive;"So it can be assumed that some scenes will still be cut... in the usual ""the fat years are over"" manner is also free rainer in the highest possible social or system or media-critical film."
negative;"Super bad, no longer time-consuming CGI effects, easy transitions and the ""softization"" (FSK 16) rub the movie down significantly."
positive;The acting task, which was to be considered, shoots out here something above the goal, and thus loses itself in a presentation of the overacting.
positive;"Conclusion: ""Treasure, take it"" is classic German comedy food, which apart from a few not youth-free verbal derailments is pleasantly above the belt line, and definitely has the ability to become the next comedy banger in the German cinemas after ""Welcome to the Hartmanns""."
negative;The scenes, in which Thor appears under the earthly normal population, offer a special fun and admiring sensation, and are inspired by â€žKate and Leopoldâ style.
positive;But I can say that I liked the basic idea of the story relatively well.
positive;It is an attempt at justice and also the beginning of an ongoing investigation of the crimes of this time!
positive;Good occupation, good movie!!!!!!!!!!!
negative;Conclusion: Supreme Trash League
negative;The Hobbit, when I heard for the first time that another Tolkien book should be filmed my enthusiasm hardly knew limits.
positive;I do not agree with the actions of the president, however, we should not let ourselves be tempted to put down his personality.
positive;Later, a merciless consequence holds the upper hand in this impressively told story.
positive;"The character acts according to their models in ""othello""."
positive;Arrived in Alaska, Chris walks through a small river on a ford.
positive;It is an enchanting story and the music is fantastic!
negative;Grazil and terrencemalickally Macdonald builds up this moment, but before the smoldering sound finally switches to hard war drama, the â€ ¬Zartliche Cousinsâ€œ number has to be accommodated: after twice holding hands (once helping with the open, once helping with the over a fence), blood-out-the-finger-suck and few changed words, Daisy is still cute, while Edmond grabs the Edward Cullen-proven stare to indicate his interest, and after the first kiss, with an â€ Â€ we shouldn ́t do thatâ€–follows the next approach of the fallout and see, there she is, the *Räusper* eternal love![...
positive;There are many very funny running-gags included in the movie, such as the wart in 2€-piece-size, which the undercover agent in Dr. Evil's company carries around in the face.
positive;The film is also very exciting.
positive;So at the beginning I had my difficulties - less to follow the action - than to wait for them now.
negative;I seem to be too old, as if I could still do something with them ... the connection to carpentry for the little ones is simply too big!
positive;These were all highlights as well.
negative;I have to look at it!
negative;Not only that the movie is stinking boring, it has an absolutely stupid ending.
positive;Arthur's youth or the announcements of the day with his friends I found simply brilliant and one could not stop looking.
positive;She repeats that John and Laura must leave Venice.
positive;Why industrial agriculture is as it is, the film is founded by the principle of internal profit maximization, without a view of the consequences resulting from it.
positive;Complemented by other icons such as Chewbacca, C-3PO or the super likeable R2-D2.
positive;Yes, the story of Chris McCandless is sad, but somewhere beautiful.
positive;Conor's development from the nicest unmusical nobody to the ballad-writing bandleader may go a little too fast in some places, but the consistently likeable actors immediately compensate each undecided spot.
positive;For many years even active in the film industry, no film has been so close to me for a very long time.
positive;Also the camera guidance is totally awesome, zb as she flies directly through the clockwork and then down to the big yard!
positive;This is how the film blazes in front of it and is just the right thing for an evening, whose day was already exhausting enough: let's get carried away.
positive;What ended up running on the screens is nothing more than a strong, modern piece of cinema.
positive;You must have seen this movie!
negative;You don't have to go to the movies for, but on DVDs will not be a soooo bad grip at some point, especially if you liked the comedies of Ice Cube.
positive;I also found very encouraging when they all went back to their old life and all had a different job.
positive;a completely different SH but me as the great Doyle fan - has convinced it.
positive;Some may open their hearts.
positive;A human life is worth nothing.
positive;This movie is one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years.
positive;Because this film represents the irreversible turning point for the American Western.
positive;Due to its relatively short playing time, the film always seems exciting.
negative;The characters are superficial, and the incredibly predictable story of kitsch and bad dialogues is sown.
negative;That'll undermine the intelligence.
positive;What's going on?
negative;The rest is a collection of clichés: Ami with perfect third teeth, Dutch with hashish, frustrated Canadian with thirsty personality, Irish writer who wants to be Joyce but can't write anymore.
negative;And on these points, the film convinces.
positive;"""Departed"" shines from the subtle character drawing to the enthralling plot."
negative;The Germans are portrayed by Spielberg in the same way as the villains from his other films: like the dinosaurs from â€žJurassic Parcâ€TM or the white shark, who killed out of instinct, the Germans simply engulf â€ždas Böseâ€TM in this film, they are not people, but an enemy power like the Orcs in â€žLord of the Ringsâ€TM, and whenever a German dies, the war is good and justified, but with the death of an American, he suddenly becomes unjust and cruel.
negative;And besides, I am quite simply with his point of view, one can distinguish good and bad people, and to do something to bad people, would be completely fine, not agree.
positive;Until yesterday I was of the opinion that John Carpenter's Halloween is the first usable horror movie of the story and treated everything previous (especially the exorcists, who was just Bloedsinn), with skepticism, but now I am convinced that there were already real shockers in the 60s.
positive;"In the Western of the Coen brothers ""True Grit"", it is about the 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) who wants to rip her father."
positive;Constantly one asks oneself, who one can trust now.
positive;And don't go into a movie to say that it's not a comic at all or that it doesn't correspond to the comic.
positive;Nevertheless, 'Ziemlich besten Freunde' (such a blöder title!)
positive;Although it's more or less about robot boxing in the process, the film delivers a lot of pop grain entertainment with heart, just as Americans love it.
negative;I personally can not enjoy something like this and still want to remember that one can also design profound, intellectually interesting topic quite mentally highly-wept AND entertaining, e.g.
positive;Just like the fourth part.
negative;As a historical drama he would probably get a better evaluation on my part.
negative;He has a lot of good acting.
positive;Exciting to the end especially the chase.
positive;A wonderful film about feelings that meets his claim to illuminate a consequence of the war.
positive;So I can't tell if she just played herself or has a huge talent.
positive;Nancy and her father Donald are with us again & get also credible appearances!
negative;They serve a bit of the mood, but they don't really bring the movie any further.
negative;This is especially noticeable in the gruesome finale.
negative;In addition, Verona Feldbusch is allowed to hush through the picture in two short scenes and quickly lose her clothes.Conclusion: Non-actional nonsense with many misguided and few good gags
positive;And that's also a point that makes the movie more complicated, time.
positive;One experiences the change of the people prominently.
positive;Jack's back!
positive;The movie has a lot more than I wanted to believe at first.
positive;Ps suuper actor
negative;until here the story is really good and more or less credible.
positive;"""Honor and strength""."
positive;She wanted to live and had not fled from Germany, but went to France with a clear mind.
positive;the lack of imagination of most people here.
positive;Contemplation to understand, to enjoy, to enjoy, to be convinced.
positive;What?
negative;"In the movie it comes so much: ""He is in my place and stört""."
positive;- The film is more complex than you want to see.
positive;And so Shape Of Water is just a functioning overall work, which, although here and there, sometimes has some beauty defects, but remains in mind in the overall picture as an absolutely wonderful film and represents a triumph of creativity and ingenuity.
negative;At first this is still beautiful and one is thrilled how good it is the performers do nevertheless with the time it just gets lonely.
positive;He gained so much power that he could use the Emperor of the Han Dynasty as a puppet.
positive;is everything in the dark green area.
positive;The expectations were incredible after it became known that Christopher Nolan (Batman trilogy, Memento, Inception) was produced and additionally involved in the story.
positive;But the chemistry is right, if even Pfeiffer as a panic control freak doesn't come over very sympathetically â€TM but that makes Clooney with his â€TMs good buddyâ€œ charm easy again!Conclusion: Standardlovestory and turbulent Hetz comedy over a messy day with sharp-tongue dialogues and Clooney as likeable as never!
positive;Shocking, rousing and funny scenes constantly alternate.
positive;Great praise also to Simon Verhoeven.
positive;Rather, I find the film-starts-critic to be humiliating.
positive;In order to understand such kind of film, however, one should watch the film quietly.
positive;Did the victim resist?
positive;This movie is simply legendary!
positive;Fresh, unconsumed kiddies in the leading roles and an exciting, non-violent and fast-paced story provide for the best mood and great fun - besides the children Smudo, Nora Tschirner, Axel Stein (again as full-blown!)
positive;*The final then just banged!
positive;"While in ""24"" or in ""House of Wax"" she only noticed by the way and did not leave a special impression, it is quite different here: her presence is simply - in one word - stunning!"
positive;They're hilarious, twisted, critical, and very sarcastic.
positive;So the movie is nothing that you can watch between door and angel - but it is worth seeing it.
positive;For me, this film, whether intended by the director or not, is a single warning of war at all.
positive;There is then as usual a lot of action called.
positive;"""Slow West"" is John Maclean's feature film, for which he also wrote the screenplay."
negative;Well.
negative;A short time later her son opens the door, and the mother asks her son if he had mastubbed.
negative;Force!
positive;This movie grabs you in the first minute and won't let you go to the last one.
positive;LG Mr Marco Sungen
negative;Conclusion: The film has the effect it should have.
positive;"By the way, who wants to watch a good anti-war movie: ""The thin red line"" (The narrow ridge) is also great!"
positive;Brad Bird and the screenwriters knew how to stage and profitably use the stronger of their actors.
positive;"the dialogues are short, crystal clear and sparkling except for the wonderfully incomprehensible brad pitt and its ""gipsy band"" - just for comfort amusing."
positive;Marcus seems rather upset and slightly twisted, but one finds nevertheless a nice, loving side, which one recognizes by how much he cares about his mother, on him.
positive;That's why the movie gets 10 points from me!!!!!
negative;Where does he come from?
negative;Aligned to his stars this should be partly funny and partly sad and with the great mysteryfinsish also also horror elements are added.
positive;Since I did not like the character drawing of one of the gang chiefs so much, which was then still something to me to BÃ¶se, so according to the motto: He is so evil, he cleans himself with tar the teeth.
positive;"The excitement and action are absolutely traceable here just like in the previous strip and you just want the adventure around ""Katniss"" and Co."
negative;last proof: TRANSFORMERS 3.
positive;Beautiful it is also the well-known characters, after so long time to see again.
positive;Crasey's art is death.
positive;Understanding of Austrian dialect is certainly of advantage.
positive;Highly recommended is the conclusion where he reconstructs the exact course of the crime.
negative;The blood flowes into trees, everything is projected in large-scale onto the screen.
positive;especially a scene in which jackson turns to his gore - past contemplating and disgusting giant insects to the touch makes the film almost physically palpable.
negative;A B-movie that reminds Stark of Stephen King's movies.
positive;"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- With all love the latest ""Asterix"" does not play itself completely free from the invocations of the Hollywood animation goods."
negative;Weapons, barbed wire and similar are missing completely.
positive;Discussions of the film-technical refinements surely find themselves better in the criticisms expert, I would like, however, than from the teacher profession itself fulfilled my astonishment about how directly the film allows the viewer to feel the situation of a little self-confident professional advocate in the teacher's existence.
positive;From the sources agree, about the food, the decoration, not to mention the two sugary main actors everything fits.
positive;Just emotional.
positive;And I think that sums it up pretty well.
positive;Quite clearly one of the strongest performances of a child what I have seen so far.
negative;Only in the first 15 minutes, a few scumbags ran away from me...
negative;Russell Carpenter's camera work can't get out of the pictures any more than is in them, but at least he illustrates the film in a variety of ways.
positive;Great.
negative;I saw the film in the sneak and I have to say, I have really never seen such a badly synchronized version of a film, or heard it.
positive;Otherwise, you should have seen Blood Diamond.
positive;Logic errors (I don't mean the Capricorn problem): Dwarves run only in the fortress, not in the fight with rest.
positive;With this movie Johnny Depp became a star overnight.
positive;The plot is gripping and humorous, the film never gets cheesy at any time.
positive;This film is worth seeing alone through the great protagonist and the well-played seculants.
positive;Very weird, sometimes something else.I watched the movie without knowing anything before.
positive;Christopher Nolan simply presupposes everything so that his film works and he proves with it that from an ExposÃ© to the imminent end of the world, nevertheless a focus can be developed.
positive;"....no wonder that this work at that time was gladly borrowed in the video library and hit right back on the counter again - Ideasless fool catch, because back then ""Police Academy"" was in everyone's mouth."
positive;But what they have delivered here is simply worth seeing, is captivating, big cinema.
negative;(What happened to the Joker???)
positive;"Likewise the effective finale, when Jerusalem is struck by the wrath of God and the comic horror effects, when Judas is pinned on by some children and who turn into monsters in front of his eyes..Conclusion: Impossible to comment or even value â€"" inhumane cruel and brutal Bible filming, perfectly and touchingly staged and occupied with Jim Caviziel insanely well, but ultimately everyone has to deal with this cinematic gloomy side."
positive;So the first one was and is just totally...
positive;Such treacherous, chewy humor is rarely found in a Hollywood stripe.
positive;for a wonderful film, which clings to the magengrube and evokes feelings that rarely a film can jam.
negative;"For me, the gag that the family rolls away with everything with a Trabbi is also not sufficient â€"" with another car this would be just as a comedy about a family on a chaotic holiday trip."
positive;Robert Downey Jr.
positive;If at the end of the film one stands in a Portuguese village in the middle of the night on the lantern-covered lonely road and hopes with the young Jan for the return of the camper with the wife, then one is in the middle and itself there.
positive;Anyone who likes movies like this should watch â€œ Selentiumâ€œ or â€œCome watch deathâ€œ.
negative;And if it had to go fast (in the film it should have been almost 20 min) they were also used.
positive;I watched the film for the first time on Arte and was totally taken by TV from the first to the last minute.
positive;That's what this movie offered, but more than I expected.
positive;In addition, there comes a wonderful tension arc, which ensures that towards the end of the film you stare at the screen as if tied to your seat and just wonder how the hell the whole thing will end!
negative;However, the film could not meet these expectations in any way.
positive;Every total is an orgasm for the eyes.
positive;Although this does not feel good, it is so tense and haunting that even the owners of the Wunderlampen would renounce the desire for something more pleasant.
negative;I like splatter films, but as they have marketed the effects here, the clouds fall from the sky.
negative;There is hardly any actor who is as busy as Ewan McGregor and thus faces such an incredible range.
negative;The four turtles Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello got them all right!
negative;With little expectations I went then also to the fully occupied cinema, and was also not particularly disheartened.
positive;In my view, the film is an absolute masterpiece!
positive;This movie is true and therefore can not alzu creepy passiren they certainly have also some shock moments built in even though that is not passirt at all the slug is still best and the two boys who has cancer under where is dead who are completely sweet
negative;He has some funny scenes, but they don't make this movie a good movie either.
positive;This good core is also awakened with the viewer and it adjusts itself to the end of the movie also this cozy Christmas feeling.
positive;The journey starts on the â€žfury roadâ€œ.
positive;Tied from the first second to the last shot... I've definitely seen worse stories - can live with it.
positive;Although he is nearly 50 years old in the meantime, he still captivates me and again and again by his timeless theme, but especially also by the archaeology, which is quite exciting even today.
positive;who likes action will come here at his expense, there is no comparable good film of this kind worldwide.
positive;Not that I don't like Asian movies, but either they're Asian or hollywood like, but please not both.
negative;Therefore: Kitano gives off a sympathetic and interesting hero, the sword fights are fast and extremely bloody and brutally staged and the underlying revenge story is not bad at least as far as I have noticed them - but that's all I can take with me.
positive;In my opinion Underworld: Uprising of the Lycans is the high point of the film series.
positive;Nicolas Cage would have earned an Oscar for that.
negative;Only the many praise hymns in advance and the discussion about the Bond actor Daniel Craig made me curious.
negative;Such a waste of money.
positive;"Conclusion: ""This movie is mindblowing""."
positive;"Makes a new movie ""Dreizen Teil 2"" That certainly goes very well with the viewers!!!"
positive;"Yesterday in the OV-Sneak in Aachen I could already see ""Man of Steel""."
negative;the movie is really good.
positive;"The first question I'm thinking about was, ""Was that the main person or is there anything else?"""
positive;V like Vendetta is really a masterpiece.
positive;Who of course hopes for daständerische Fähigkeiten by Till Schweiger, can only be disheartened.
negative;What else can I say?
positive;Conclusion: Who keeps the film for weak - look at it again, think about backgrounds and just peek into the people that are shown there.
negative;In a completely overdramatized chase (which does not occur in the book), our digital dragon follows Harry Potter.
positive;Laura Linney must also be mentioned here.
positive;Prof. Borg, who has dedicated his life to the love of science, goes on a journey with his daughter-in-law to receive an honorary title.
positive;"Super Story super cast for a long time again a good movie ;) worth seeing Super exciting and unexpected you can grÃ1⁄4bel and speculate a lot.The movie is very entertaining."
positive;Even if the film does not bring any really new findings about the near-east situation, I liked an aspect nevertheless very well.
positive;Finally again good German cinema.
negative;And why a member of the original crew must bite into the grass as a big final point (whereby the course for a possible rebirth is already set!
positive;The Kiddis of Sandler are too spoiled.
positive;Stop it!
negative;A bunch of tame muscle spree will hardly go over it, that without runningback and Reciever no game can be won.
positive;Those who can't do anything about it at all.
positive;Doesn't he have trouble separating truth and illusion?
positive;Adding to this is an extremely sympathetic hero's troupe, where Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward make a wonderfully funny team.
positive;I had a cheese skin that left me with a chill.
positive;"The fact that there are no emotions in the prevailing world of Equilibrium is interesting but difficult to implement in terms of film technology before and well, the movie gets a little sick of it can hardly make me know that in the facial expression of Bale (although he is a great actor what he has already proven several times ""American Psycho"" and also the rest of the cast is excellent among other things also Sean Bean plays not to be confused with Senn Penn with whom I also very much like to see since the Lord of the Rings and Game of THrones he has a bonus with me; just a great actor who has never managed to get up to the top but nevertheless belongs to the good Hollywoods) is not yet a hidden aggression."
positive;Funny and exciting movie.
negative;It starts with the fact that Zeus misses his ruling flash and just once Poseidon's son Percy succumbs to theft.
positive;But: it is a comic film, so I would check off the carnage under comic violence, especially since the strip also manages to sprinkle in the big bloodbath still small gags.The general plot is actually only the xte times the old â€žGood against evilâ€œ lyre, nevertheless there is up to the gigantic showdown with Snipes and Dorff against each other a logical and varied plot with tricks and twists.
positive;Who really inspired me was the absolutely great Kate Winslet.
positive;They take drugs, beat women, do it with old bald hats of their own friends - oh, what already counts friendship here, just a change of insults.
positive;The same would have been possible to shoot somewhere in remote areas of northern or southern Germany.
positive;I had a good time with the movie.
positive;Since it wasn't overly bloody or too much based on final destination there's a thumb high.
positive;I'm sure you're looking!
positive;I can only say to all who now compare these two films that it is very difficult for me to do so, because the films are simply different and TDKR is more like Batman Begins.
positive;This film shows the true happiness of a young man.
negative;The big plus is in my eyes the really fine, glaring love relationship.
negative;Otherwise, the jokes were all right.
positive;"A form of residual recycling sounding rather weak at the first moment: John Cho appeared on the edge in all three â€œ American Pieâ€œ films («€žFinchâ€œ actor Eddie Kaye Thomas appears here on the edge) and Kal Penn was the harsh Indian in â€žParty Animalsâ€œ (whose star Ryan Reynolds has a short appearance as a gay nurse) â€"" and this film makes the two marginal actors the main characters."
positive;He shows us how beautiful life can be.
positive;Everyone knows Kubrick is the King yo!
positive;Big and all it is really worth spending the money for the movie.
positive;one can hardly imagine what the sacrifices must suffer.
negative;Unfortunately, Mirrors isn't here without mistakes.
positive;The supporting actors I personally find again very well set in scene.
positive;The movie is just as awesome as Starship Troopers!
positive;But somehow it comes even more authentically, which is also due not least to the great performance of the young Ridley.
positive;It's a strong movie, with great actors, impressive moments and great music.
positive;I feel it!!!!!!!!!
positive;The subtext message is a bit intrusive, but this is usually the case with such stripes and did not stop.
positive;"Since I'm a big ""Lord of the Rings"" fan, I went with strong expectations in Peter Jackson's new film."
positive;There's nothing going on like Van Damme wants.
positive;But everyone should form their own perspective, in the end the statement of the film is nevertheless clearly recognizable.
positive;Nero just doesn't like him, not because Eric Bana wouldn't play him really well, but because the figure takes up too little space.
negative;There are certainly people who like such a movie and such an archetype very much, but that might be more likely to be female viewers.
positive;THERE'S no need for cinemas to be entertained, and nothing else.
positive;For this the film is getting better and better - and that's what counts!
positive;The last negative aspect was the quick switch at the end, with only a few seconds between the end of the fight against Ultron and the new beginning of the Avengers.
positive;Many don't know that casino Royale is playing BEFORE everyone else, so it's very PASSING that the James Bond is still a bit raw, not yet resorting to years of experience and gentlemanly charm.
positive;Spannand and logical the history is not told without wit.
positive;"But how does such a one develop I call it ""field attempt of love"" when one half demands too much and the other sees itself overwhelmed by it?"
positive;"...I miss with some who judge here prematurely both about the new Bond films in general, as well as about ""A Quantum Consolation"" in particular and everything new - partly better - in untranslated ""Hsn, bla, that is different than usual and therefore bad"" manners totmack."
negative;Chilean director Pablo Larraón has developed into a favourite of international festivals with exciting, multi-layered works such as â€žNo!â€œ (criticism) and â€žEl Clubâ€œ (criticism).
negative;Shining performance of the actors?
positive;Conclusion: A bond adventure that you could already see in the 60s, at Connery's times!
positive;The only criticism for me was the overdrawn scene as Klein-Kirky on the ice planet had to fight against superpowerful monsters until Old-Spocky saved in.
positive;All in all, a very successful film.
positive;Perhaps that one denies something that the victims of Distomo cannot deny in themselves, here experience worlds do not come to meet each other surably?
positive;Thank you!
positive;who also does this and has an idea from where I get this film on video or dvd, should contact me!
positive;"What's quite amusing is that Woody Allen later refers to the movie ""back""."
positive;I find it interesting that both of these films are able to take religious faith seriously, because their main characters do, without taking the doctrine, itself, very seriously.
positive;The story of the film is surprisingly intelligently made.
positive;I'd like to go in again
negative;I looked at the movie in 3D and must say that the 3D effects didn't knock me out.
positive;The situation is getting worse and worse.
negative;what works very well with a computer game works my -personal - opinion here but not at all good.
positive;After the release of the fourth film, vll.
positive;Curiously he visits the place and finds the woman obnoxious.
positive;Otherwise for me the best film in years: a masterpiece!
positive;No happy ending or a beautiful spoken sad ending, but just a possible truth that ends in full hardness.
positive;After all, reports about terrorist attacks on Amercan troops in Iraq, if they are still encroached, have recently become a habit.
positive;"Well what you had expected from ""Kill Bill vol.1"" was confirmed, but unfortunately you can't quite say that from ""Kill Bill vol.2""."
positive;Maybe the film-start critic was also drunk when he watched the movie... haha.
positive;At least the women are defensive, but only at the end decides who survives or Crawler-Futter is.
positive;This is one.
positive;Very well researched and produced documentary about the American drone program.
negative;The CGI was excellent and the crash looked very realistic.
positive;But the salt in the soup in this masterpiece of the 007 series was the title music, which really underlined the corresponding scenes !!
positive;Must have just seen it.
negative;"""A degree."""
positive;All the characters are well thought out and occupied, the book publisher, and the little Chinese who works in SmartTech as well as Andy's boss who plays the same music DVD every morning.
negative;The usually anything but delicately timed dialogues offer after all some saucomic lines.
negative;I believe that an action of this kind would have guaranteed a more solid and above all much creative basis for the continuation of one of the greatest stories brought in film history.
positive;This part includes more variety in places and there are also several characters available.
negative;Conclusion: Even as a fan of Rowan Atkinson not to empathize.
positive;Day after day, people from the quarter come to him and ask him for money, small contributions, about which he carefully guides the book and for which he is able to give himself collateral.
positive;The Revival of Terry Benedikt e.g.
positive;Your precious love.
positive;"Also worth mentioning: Ewen Bremner as an annoyingly smeared lover, Peter Dinklage as a surprise guest at the funeral, Peter Vaughan as a quirky uncle Alfie, Rupert Graves as a successful but burnt-down writer and Kris Marshall as a Troy, who secretly brings cool ""tablet mixes"" among the people."
positive;But: I have decided to try to understand this movie myself according to the possibility, before I read IRGENDWAS about it elsewhere.
positive;Pulp Fiction is a very good movie yet missing in this movie the action.man has never been with a person,otherwise top movie with a horny story!
negative;The reviews already mentioned here (why white middle class family in the center, why Coca Cola advertising) I would like to underline at one point.
positive;Jackson didn't make any mistakes about the occupation either.
negative;==References==
negative;The fight scenes were also not particularly spectacular, so I did not pay attention.
positive;Never experienced such a silent cinema (and it was full!).
positive;after that every damn fool sounds like this...yes what does the murdered actually give of itself???
positive;"If you like ""Billy Elliot"" or ""Popular music from Vittula"" - you will get your money's worth here (even if ""music as liberation"" plays a minor role here)."
positive;You're really being spelled out and the current topic is very, very interesting.
positive;In any case, this is finally a movie that appeals to everyone.
negative;The soundtrack can be bought confidently, which is also good without film.
positive;It's just great.
negative;The film content doesn't come out to me.
positive;For me an exciting film with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, you have to adjust to the unusual camera.
negative;The theme itself cannot be to choose the horrible pervertedness of snuffvideos inherently as a theme is associated with high risk, especially since the insight into this disgustingness is necessary in order to be able to begin an examination with the topic.
positive;But precisely these moments make the whole story more real, more tangible and more approachable.
positive;[â€¦]As a voice of a good conscience with a clear right/unright feeling, the cap gets out a few deputy core sentences (Â»This isnâ€TMt freedom.
negative;Or in short, my biggest fear scenario for the name Pacific Rim has occurred: it's almost like a Transformers movie.
positive;Thus one can arouse interest for the art, which arises out of a bouncy life.
positive;I find it interesting that the viewer sees Jigsaw personally in the course of the film.
positive;Orcs and people look so dirty and you can see the traces of the fight.
positive;Then the allegation to JJ to remove everything, in order to be sure that the film also includes, well, exactly such an allegation is ridiculous.
positive;But it is and remains very daring what Mr. Boll delivered there, because surely (only admit this will of course hardly one, just like no one ever bought a Modern Talking record) one or another spectator catches off and at the same time secretly to feel a little bit of sympathy for this killer ... Handcrafted well and solidly made, in relation to the budget really succeeded.
positive;Seen.
negative;What are you doing?
positive;However, I felt the last attitude of the film before the credits as completely inappropriate and inappropriate for the entire scenery of the film.
positive;And Love, Simon does really a lot for that just this normality is increasing ever more.
negative;3.
negative;so unfortunately also here ... while the film (through pictures and music) is a distressing atmosphere, but that can't save a really bad story.
positive;So, in and laugh!
positive;And the terrifying end, in which Kubrick puts way even works with the â€žShining atmosphereâ€œ.
positive;Really great movie.
positive;I really liked the movie, I've looked at it a lot and I have it on DVD too!
positive;Even the 10th time I cried!
positive;We are ingrained animation movies fans and this is absolute top.
positive;"Also as a gangster bride Sasori (which is based on the actual four-part movie ""Sasori"", he goes up completely and contributes eeriely to the joke and charm of the movie."
positive;Even really well visualized films don't get to the level of Kubrick long ago.
positive;If you think the other x-men away because otherwise a large part of the story doesn't make any real sense eg: wolverine remembers Nagasaki even though that happened before his head shot, wolverine lives suddenly lonely in the mountains although in x-men 3 something like that is not even hinted at well I hope I didn't miss you with it the movie
positive;The religious part, the madness, the social aspects and especially the own survival drive towards the survival of humanity, have all been presented very authentically.
positive;Now finally a real action film comes into the cinema again.
negative;Also, the really interesting plot is far too long.
positive;"I wanted to do the right thing Scream didn't succeed, a horror comedy that is primarily funny.That said Keenen Ivory Wayans in the interview for Scary Movie ""Scream""(10/10) is not completely witless, but Scary Movie only wanted the humor.Generally Scary Movie can be seen as an object to Scream."
positive;Great actors, very nice film music, well-researched story (yes - Dali was such a tough guy!
positive;"To this end, the whole film plays itself through highs and lows, and actually manages at the end to satisfy every character with a laughing and a crying eye: Stephen creates the (meaningly) perfect fraud and dies in this certainty, Bloom is free and can now stay with Penelope (who meanwhile blew up her house; she has just learned a lot from Bang Bang)."
positive;"So I really liked the movie, much better than ""Roadtrip"" (which is from the same makers)!"
positive;That's why the movements of the figures come here also considerably more fluently.
negative;Well, a movie where the synopsis actually played the most important thing and you can think the rest of it - and so it is here as well.
positive;I lack the death of Barricade (this is still done in the supplementary reading of Prime) and there are also a few inconsistencies.
positive;It seems that one or the other may be distracted by too much the first time.
positive;His name is Snake Plissken.
negative;The plot itself is loosely based on the true story of the Balian of Ibelin, but unfortunately this was implemented by Scott quite flat and later, so that at no time can anything similar like tension be built up.
positive;I saw the movie for the first time in part on TV.
positive;While at first the characters are surprisingly pale due to the unusual archetypal structure, this changes in the course of the film.
negative;No successor!
positive;The humor comes very well and plentifully in this film and evaporates something the drama, which alludes to the German thinking.
positive;shortly before his coronation to the king of Bavaria in 1864 and in StÃ1⁄4ckelung the period until his end.
negative;Conclusion: Don't look at this movie, a single disaster!!!!!
positive;Cineastic especially worthwhile!
positive;Adrenalin-induced entertainment.
negative;No, thanks.
positive;Beautiful romance, with very interesting human images and developments, as well as intellectual and stimulating topics!
positive;Rush Hour 2 is a sensationally funny movie, and without Chris Tucker he would have been half as good and half as successful, making him as a nerve-saw in the movie is not okay.. find the movie great.
negative;The story is boring and the actors won't convince for a second.
negative;The movie is definitely not a bad one, but considering its proponents and a lot of small dicks it is for me the worst of the series.
positive;A milestone in the crime department - Kult Film!
negative;However, this can still not make a good movie, so that the team, like so often cop films (or heroes in general), relied on the confrontation of its protagonists.
positive;That she does not speak Â3⁄4 of the strip and therefore has to use her screentime in the nonverbal range, it makes it even more powerful what this girl does with her facial expressions â€ , please more of it!!
negative;Good attachments, a lot of passion and yet the film scrapes to the largest part and in almost all areas only on the surface.
negative;Well, the movie's okay, nothing superior, even good average.
positive;â€žKing Arthur: Legend of the Swordâ€ is for me the almost perfect mixture of fantasy spectacle and history.
positive;"Absolutely profound and deliberately ""slowly"" tells, as one could expect."
positive;Anyone who hasn't seen the film, one of the great masterpieces I think there are, has not seen it yet: you won't regret it!
positive;There you go.
positive;...I have to look elsewhere.
positive;When they dance, they let out all their frustration.
positive;"As soon as I heard that this was the replacement of the cult movie ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", I knew that I had to see this movie!"
positive;"The former reference in terms of espionage film has already gotten serious competition a long time ago and has undergone a fresh cell cure with Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royal"", which catapulted the old-baked fabric of the Cold War spy into the new era, in which neither the body nor the good are clearly defined and one-dimensional."
positive;A good movie that shows the real face of the Americans well.
positive;At the end still something to the brutality, with which one can count on with a Romero film.
positive;The course of the film has increased more and more tension and the Aikidoszen with Steven Seagal were very well implemented and completely choegraphed without doubles.
positive;the more I was impressed by this masterpiece.
positive;and at this difficult hour, where great Britain is close to war against Germany, it needs a man who with raised head, courage and strength acquiesces to his own people.
positive;"Boyle is set up as a policeman in western Ireland with the so-called ""Garde"" and leads a quiet and tranquil life."
positive;Intense chamber play of deck over loneliness and isolation, in its existentialistic cultivation basic conditions of man.
positive;But now back to the film.
positive;Nevertheless, in my opinion, it comes out that many of the boys also had their joy in the Napola.
positive;What Nicholas Winding Refn (â€žWalhalla Risingâ€œ, â€žBronsonâ€œ) created with his first Hollywood film is no less than an instant masterpiece, a film, perfectly staged and orchestrated, each scene in itself a work of art, as rarely seen in the cinema.
positive;Great acting performance from the Vincent Cassel, who was unknown to me until then, who plays a bank robbing gangster, who far overshadows his own person and nevertheless strives for the title of the state enemy number 1.
positive;In the last room, the master is allowed to reach personally: Quentin Tarentino.
positive;Thus, this film doesn't even get so bad here by leading the total contrast program: the film is staged with state-of-the-art means, but gives itself like an old-fashioned horror film.
positive;He comes a little quickly and passes - unfortunately - again quickly.
negative;The gags, or the comedy is not particularly funny and the effects are pretty bad, which would have to be normal, since it is not crazy to be a trash film, or at the border of a trash film.
negative;It's not just a story that's missing, it's missing everything.
positive;";)"
positive;The direction of Baz Luhrmann is almost perfect.
positive;"Despite really bad pictures, he does not stamp the samurai in the land of the rising sun as a ""monster"", but rather makes them argue so well that as a spectator one has perfect understanding for their reaction."
negative;Why does every sequence, every event have to be completely changed and replaced by something quite new?
negative;No..., it is still impossible to reach the vicinity of the sun at all until now, without drifting into the realm of fantasy/sciFi!
positive;But in short, you get to see what you expect, quick action!
positive;I've seen the movie for the 5 times and I'm still deeply impressed.
positive;But in addition, for the first time he gives reason to stimulate our brain during the film and encourages us to think.
positive;Nothing's wrong with it.
positive;"the overexposed, high-stitched images are also already small works of art for themselves and remind of photographs by larry clark or his films, especially ""ken park""."
positive;For fans so quite worthwhile or even more...
negative;Too bad - little good luck.
negative;Action Top, but the story is so full of logic puzzles that you could make smooth Sharknado competition!
positive;And Sadece Sen has it...and has it a lot!
positive;It's a damn awesome movie!
positive;The performances of the main actors are, without wanting to operate now, excellent (of course in relation to the original English version without synchronization).
positive;Because in the form of Jude Law and Jack Black is soon already the unexpected rescue in need before the door.
positive;In a scene Ennis comes out of the tent and everywhere there is snow and it looks simply fabulous.
positive;It's just a movie and not a normal episode.
positive;The basic idea alone is brilliant.
positive;No matter where you look, teddy bears are cuddly soft, always have a grin in the face and are always to be felt as sweet.
positive;Nevertheless, you have to say that part 2 irritates the topic of minions to the pain limit.
positive;one never knows as well as it should go on now, how he comes out of this situation now again.
negative;I just want something to happen.
positive;The movie seems more than impressive to me.
positive;Only the masquerade of the facial expressions of all figures (except for Tifa) formed a wormwood drop.
negative;A classic blockbuster, brain out, eyes/ears open, a bucket of popcorn in your arm and when you leave the cinema, you have forgotten the whole movie again.
negative;"As ""inconceivable scrap"" I would not call the strip now, but even the 4 points for ""lau"" would already be too much of the good."
positive;"I have now given this movie ""only"" 4 stars because the beginning is quite confusing."
negative;A cruel film without tension, wit or logic.
positive;He is by far THE highlight in the movie.
positive;and apart from that, the story is also suuuuppi!must be recommended and it also makes extreme lust on part two!
positive;The film consists of dream scenes of the protagonist, which are exaggerated but brilliantly portrayed.
positive;"I say of the level of trickery the film, as has already been mentioned, is not quite as good as ""ratatouille"", because it is kept easier by the ""background density"" and not as almost perfect and above all."
negative;Damage :(
positive;In addition, the question arises, whereby a so-called film connoisseur is distinguished.
positive;That I liked this easily is perhaps due to the fact that Martel's book is incredibly exciting and inspiring.
positive;Maybe it's the main character, or maybe the subject.
positive;The DvD included are: The main movie on 2 DvDs A documentary about the making of Love Exposure Deleted Scenes The cover motif is beautiful and the inside is also printed with a haunting motif from the film.
positive;So I will definitely buy it on DVD!!
positive;The Sowert Union honored the rifle with a mint, Mozambique brought it to its flag, the end of the Cold War the Kalashnikov had become the great export property of the Russian people, after which came Vodka, caviar and suicide-prone novelists.
positive;A great soundtrack is added.
negative;It is not a leading role, but it is more entertaining to follow their offspring than to follow the changing Anne Hathaway.
positive;Less softening organs (no pathos inlays), more authenticity and especially sympathetic actors round off the very good implementation.
negative;Völlig overlaid action spectacle, which does not make any intellectual claim to its audience.
positive;The ultimate horror film of the generation of today's parents.
positive;What more do you want?
negative;A remake that no one needs.
positive;Graphic Novel of the Year.
positive;The end in itself is too clear and conventional for me to put it that way.
positive;"That's why you can't understand age clearance from ""16""."
positive;"The two young leading actors do their thing really great, the archetype I liked very much (at the beginning the thoughts of ""R"" to hear) and the gags sit almost always."
negative;Clearly, a film for basic students.
negative;"If you spend two hours in absolute darkness in front of a superb TV with high-quality DTS-sounding and do not set up or set up a single glass skin, then the device is either not switched on or it runs ""Silent Hill""."
negative;In the Bourne parts, he's impressed, just like in The Informant.
negative;Instead, we see funny dancing gorillas and hear a song, how funny and colorful everything is with the monkeys.
negative;Walter Goodfellow has an excuse every time not to bother about it now.
negative;This creates unity, which is interrupted only by the night shots from time to time.
positive;Oldschoolaction in the future!
positive;Taylor Kitsch gave off a good John Carter and Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris was also very handsome.
positive;Ok, the film has already been on the hump for a few years â€ , when it was shown in the cinema in 1991 I was 11 years old and read about it in various magazines, but of course had no chance to see it in any way.
positive;RECOMMENDED VALUE
positive;Brilliant.
negative;Normally I also like cheesy and sad movies, but that was really just a row of overly kitschy, trivial scenes.
positive;and you have to say that chan didn't have as much action scenes as in the first two films (it's probably the 53).
positive;Apart from the action, I also feel the cut, the scenery and the pictures.
positive;Reports about the crime in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez - the Mexican sister city of El Paso/Texas - with the many thousand murders in the drug war show, what Escalante with his small, poignant drama with considerable acting achievements has clearly illustrated.
positive;Nevertheless, the film never gets boring.
positive;This is a very important aspect of the Commission's work.
positive;What Fresnadillo is digging out of his sleeve is a trump that banishes the spectators into the seats.
positive;The movie is really hard but very good!Hilary Swank really deserves the Oscar for this role!You have to have it in his DVD shelf!
positive;The place where Joe sits in his cinema and looks at the game and understands that he's not alone in the field, I thought best.
positive;Who places value on a good story, ground dialogues and many feelings.
positive;Together with alice he leads to the devil in the desert, and I believe that pete knew this from the beginning and only asked retorically.
positive;Good thing the vampires don't speak the language of their victims.
positive;Here there can simply be no detailed and down to the smallest detail explainable history.
positive;The problems are presented in such a complex and realistic way that one is carried along.
positive;I found the implementation of the story pretty good and even though some dialogues were rather involuntarily funny, so I liked the movie in large measure.
positive;Wonderful film, in which music classics were made in a wonderful way suitable for Moulin Rouge.
positive;Wow.
positive;With a budget of just $26 million, Jackie Chan has staged a wonderful film.
positive;The whole story and the whole system behind it were built in a logical and credible way, whereby as a spectator one always thinks with a smile â€žAch so runs it in the headâ€œ.
negative;The end of the film is then for me also questionable and illogical.
negative;The format brings, in particular with the settings that capture the nature, neat atmosphere.
positive;Exciting Intelligent Action That Makes You Think
negative;"""Sunshine"", as one can imagine with the names, is not an ""Armageddon"" rip-off and creates from the very beginning a threat that comes straight from the staging of the impossible, the flight of the crew to a border, the direct confrontation with one's own mortality and not that this does not take place in every average thriller, but normally one does not have the feeling of standing at the abyss and shaking the ground under the feet..."
positive;Spoiler: Arnold Schwarzenegger is brutal, sweet and funny at the same time!
negative;The end is only a preparation for the 3.
positive;However, you have to like the kind of movies!
positive;Far too late Scarlett realizes the value of her family and her legacy, much too late she realizes her attachment to Melanie Wilkes, the wife of her unattainable swarm Ashley, much too late she realizes that Rhett Butler is the love of her life.
positive;The first Tolkien/Jackson trilogy is amazing!
positive;The 'Drag me to Hell' is not a real horror movie you should already know, because the movie actually puts everything on horror.Admittedly, I never really wanted to get excited about the movie, but I didn't get bored either.
positive;The basis of such an approach is the fantastic at Burton.
negative;But under these criticisms there are then nevertheless almost throughout also unground pearls.
positive;Conclusion: Polithriller of the old school whose themes are old, but have been implemented in advance and with little help!
positive;Each scene and setting is treated with so much care and love that the entire length of the movie becomes a single pleasure for the heart/soul and eye.
positive;for me, alien is next to odyssee 2001 THE best sci-fi film of all times.
positive;My first sentence certainly seems formal to me, but you still understood me.
negative;Unfortunately, the above things are the only thing I really liked about this movie.
negative;Well, what do you say to a movie like that...?
negative;A little bit overstated the representation of this victim role, I didn't buy Jackman.
positive;How were these possible?
positive;The Green Mile is a masterpiece!!!
positive;Some people may now see this as a minus point, but it doesn't make sense to me.
positive;Cast was top.
positive;Of course there are competition and father-son conflicts.
positive;Definitely among the top 3 1.
positive;They just couldn't escape, even though they just wanted to live their lives.
positive;Jodie Foster again proved what an excellent actress she is.
negative;However, if you see the film, the question will be answered immediately.
negative;I would like to refer to the excellent review of Phoenix0, which meets the core of the thing 100%.
positive;Conclusion: The film is what a man needs, if he just wants to turn off his brain and want to indulge himself in women and action.
positive;You can also solve a feeling effect differently.
positive;(Finally, it's almost embarrassing with what incredible ignorance and stupidity some people here rate movies.
positive;With the strongly deviating ending from normal crime, which almost already evokes disaster film scenarios, Lars Kraume seems to exaggerate it at first glance then nevertheless a little.
positive;On the one hand the curiosity and on the other hand the fact that film adaptations usually deviate from the book or so.
positive;But that's not the only reason he's great.
positive;Despite its problems, the film's approach to showing the battle in Darfur from the perspective of a person who can leave the horror at any time has succeeded: the event becomes clear without the victims being denounced or abused as a staffage.
positive;"Less important I find the description of the environment (exciting fathers and speechless mothers there are everywhere), but rather it is above all about a friendship; one learns once again how easy it is to hurt a friend."
positive;These were only 2 examples, otherwise this would go on forever.
positive;I find for my part the filmmakers have done great things.
negative;But Monica Bellucci is the most gifted.
positive;Unlike the other heroes such as Superman, Batman or Flash (except the old cartoons), Wonder Woman shines with a new charm and unfortunately well-known story, but it didn't change much, so this is not creeded as a negative point.
negative;THX...,1984 and a little Blade Runner let you know.
negative;So bad dialogues that they could have jumped out of any x-any C movie.
positive;Mary Poppins was (and is) one of the most famous children's films from Disney from the 1960s.
positive;Confidential is pure perfect from the story and I also think you can look at it well, but unfortunately I don't think that the movie totally pulled me into a bann.
negative;Not so dolle, not so cool, more distasteful sequel to the cult hit of 73.
positive;Explained?
negative;If they don't have their dick in their hands, they have a gun in their hands, which goes to the same thing.
positive;However, the film pulls out in length and it is placed too little worth on the bosses !
positive;Just imagine Keanu Reeves and Will Smith playing in the movie and with a lot of fantasy this movie is a real bitch.
positive;The life of the six-year-old Mason (Ellar Coltrane), his family and their problems and worries are quickly revealed to the viewer, which makes it possible to enter the film easily and at a time - this is certainly not completely irrelevant with a total of 163 minutes of play time.
negative;I didn't like the extremely fast cuts in the fight scenes, the computer animation in the fight on the shuttle had computer game level.
positive;Although Charly (Logan Lerman) is still a teenager, this boy had to go through a lot.
positive;The movie is really nice, it is a well-successful connection from comedy and love story.
negative;The whole amateur-like recorded and cut and without any action and without any sense increased to 160 minutes.
positive;Absolutely not.
negative;The story does not at all show that the man is a child's employer and child's murderer.
positive;I couldn't sleep last night!
positive;Who thinks now, now I know and can save me the movie, is wrong.
negative;OK he didn't fit into the horror scenario now because he had some funny, cool cracks on it.
positive;9 out of 10 points!!
positive;"Asghar Farhadi's ""The Past"" and Abdellatif Kechich's ""Blue is a warm color"" were e.g. just a piece more refined."
positive;Conclusion: Very exciting and ingeniously staged thriller, which is based on historical circumstances.
positive;The movie is quite long, but you don't notice that, because the story is told well.
negative;But more fatal still is that not a single new idea was introduced into this movie.
negative;This is not too short in much and especially in the beginning no second passes, where no gag is torn.
positive;The film confronts one with dying and that naturally does not affect everyone.
negative;Nicolas Cage has already had many bad roles in recent years.
positive;I really liked the movie.
positive;An uncorruptible commissioner (Paul Giamatti) threatens to be crushed by the bosses of the state power.
positive;every one of us who has eaten, lives over the masses of Europeans should watch this film ... actually he should be compulsory material in school.
positive;kind of funny and nice idea to play as a jean claude himself.
positive;Okay, I saw the movie a couple of days ago and I think it's very good,but if I hear you can compare the movie with Jack Dame könnig Grass that's not true because layers cake no comedie is like boom dame könnig grass the movies have nothing to do with each other.The movie is very tense and very well done especially the end is good.
positive;"Instead, Tarantino took a novel at hand and wrote Elmore Leonard's crime novel ""Rum Punch"" (""Rum Punch"" in 1992) into a script that was to become an homage to one of his personal heroines: blaxploitation icon Pam Grier."
positive;And you can understand why a third person is a child.
positive;I read an interview with Vivien Leigh, who plays Scarlett O'Hara.
positive;Spoiler to the end: Spoiler: Despite that I'm not a fan of open ends (for me he has more or less an open end) , I have to say that this movie is one of the best of all times.
positive;and if then the concern wanted the dead jesu, and she was now Jewish, this has nothing to do with anti-Semitism.
positive;What would have come out of it?
negative;Sorry but this is the most unrealistic scenario I've ever seen in a US war movie !
negative;The content must be rhymed together.
negative;The drama, which is created by the dreams above all for our main character Jessie (Kate Bosworth), which both uses it as a healing and breaks it, was just as understandable as a good idea.
positive;Jackson now offers all the means to conjure up impressive pictures on the screen and to let the viewer trembl until the end.
positive;Good leading actors also contribute to this.
positive;A fun for young and old.
positive;The opening credits came - Oh God, a French film in the 70s, that can be something.
positive;Just strong!
positive;I find the film very well done, especially the scenes in the Capitol were well staged.
positive;Spoiler: Arrival basically picks up what Interstellar tried to describe in 2014, which means that time (some theories) does not always go as far as we perceive it on Earth.
positive;I just saw Black Rain the second time and still liked the movie as good as a year ago.
positive;Also the acting performances are all convincing, especially by Justin Timberlake.
negative;That's it.
negative;The story is not very intelligent and the actors are also maximum averaged.
positive;While the film avoids realism with quiet humor, harsh dialogues, distinctive, romantic figures, a Hitchockian light set and a 70s look and has grotesque teeth, the humor never seems to be the nightly garnish of a sad story to satisfy the desires of harmonizing audiences.
positive;I'm sure anyone who liked Hangover will love this one.
positive;The dialogues were partly very well worked out and provided with the cute joke.
negative;Totally boring movie.
positive;"Irreversibly, we are confronted with the hard-hitting fact (which truly does not affect everyone) that EVERYTHING is inconvenient and time does not know ""mercifulness""."
positive;Just the generation that grew up with this music, the feeling of life and the social upheavals of a SpieÃ ̈ergeneration capture the viewer very quickly.
positive;I think Star Wars III is the best of the new ones.
negative;by far not to characterize these women as what they are supposed to be here according to the script.
positive;...a murderous triology... although I find part 1 better, nevertheless I like to indulge myself in the suffering of the next sacrifice!
positive;A twisted story with real characters that is worth discovering.
negative;Unfortunately, the director can't do this.
positive;"In the 60 he more precisely in the years 1966/67 there was once a series Names ""The Green Hornet"" similar to the then Batman series."
positive;Who, like no other film, transports a vibe.
positive;Actually a clear 10 of 10 points candidate, but since the Americans must always exaggerate it with their happy endings a point deduction.
positive;"I can partly understand the bad opinions.. Keyword: dream sequences or spoilers: ""Martha"" However, this doesn't make a bad movie for me - by far no catastrophic film."
positive;Because apart from the large-scalely functioning ensemble, and the undisputedly successful optics, everything else lies in the eye of the viewer.
positive;I don't want the Vatican to get so upset either.
negative;In the end, everything is too confused.
positive;Just because this movie is so untypical for a 007 movie is rro maybe that's why so good !
negative;And I mean really many!!!
positive;"Already a few years before, the joint film ""Good Fellas"" had become a masterpiece, now the next one follows."
positive;And just this year only very few films can claim this!
positive;I can understand that some people just don't have this fantasy universe.
positive;This may be type-casting by origin, but they do their thing quite well.
positive;But it is not so tragic that the viewer in the cinema seat does not bend with laughter, as the trailer of the film wants to tell.
positive;One recognizes simply the unconditional will to make the film so beautiful bad and just nevertheless good.
positive;Everyone who goes with some claim in cinema will not be disappointed.
positive;The music fits so well and the scene is still so well staged that it is perfection for me.
positive;For that it deviates already already too far what also for many a problem will be Smokin Aces correctly classify.
positive;When I read the transcription of the movie, I thought I might like it.
positive;The animation style is still brilliant.
positive;Although I am not such a convinced Tarantino fan, I found his short appearance funny.
negative;Due to the trailer and the reports, I went to the cinema today and watched the movie in 3D.
positive;Once you have understood or resolved to understand yourself from the thought of Lost Highway to the smallest detail, first of all one thing remains back and that is a deeply staggering, thirsty and hypnotizing masterpiece.
positive;Casino is without a doubt a really strong mafia movie!
positive;In his role in The Wrestler, he is The Wrestler.
negative;And the story's course is also predictable and boring.
positive;Unbeatable is the laughter of woman sarnau and so many educational pieces closes, as the film is about the production of sour herbs.
negative;We're miles away from that now.
negative;Completely unscathed.
positive;a wonderful film that you can watch over and over again... brilliantly shot and bruce willis plays the savior of the world times naturally great even if the film is a bit older you could watch it again in 10 years because it is just good and you always like to be with you again
positive;You have to say, however, that doesn't matter.
negative;Instead, continuing boredom and also the end... hardly to top, but also only in a negative sense.
positive;It's incredible what Abrahamson is getting out of this movie.
positive;Conclusion: Must have seen, great end, crazy story.
negative;But the dialogues between robot woman Ava (Alicia Vikander) and the somewhat naive Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) are super boring.
positive;Antennas for Arthouse provided, one can look forward to 92 minutes of continuous smiles with this conglomerate from melancholy and coolness.
positive;Maybe it's better that way too - finally, not everyone can handle it...
positive;The voice I find stupid and his connections are too predictable in my opinion.
positive;Those who like hard films and are looking for intelligent films are well served here.
positive;"John Carney succeeds in throwing together an interesting story, hilarious (and lovable) characters and lots of humor in ""Sing Street"" and creating an outstanding film."
negative;Red Sparrow calls himself the work and plays mainly in Russia.
positive;But I was taught a better one!
positive;In the course of Conjuring the visitation I had already informed myself about the work of the Warrens and I also came to the Enfield case.
negative;Nevertheless, there are some cool action sequences here that just make fun.
positive;Those who have fallen from the chair already in the last years with The Babadook or It Follows should perhaps rather leave the fingers of this.
negative;There is no main character to be oriented to and the project 'Ego-Shooter' seems to be able to justify everything, but that is simply not enough.
positive;Why didn't the Oscars pay attention to this?
negative;[...] The most difficult thing about Billy Lynn is his dealings with himself.
positive;"Those who want to have it related to African despots, in the sense of a psychological profile even more bloody and ruthless should look at the ""last king of Scotland"" with the ultimately completely crazy Idi Amin (Forrest Whitaker) ;) Excellent cinema, without false pathos without American audacity and yet deeply human."
positive;This question concerned millions of fans.
positive;Batman Begins is an appetite for more.
positive;Anyone who believes to watch a light, bloodless and epic sci-fi film will have to twitch several times in the cinema chair.
positive;Hi, so I find all the books both the movies totally great.
positive;After paying attention to trailers on the Internet, one might expect a two-and-a-half-hour, merciless Nazi-clip with weapons of any kind and thus a similar blood-stained epic as Kill Bill once did.
negative;What do these two proposals have to do with each other?
positive;This movie gets so deep into your heart that it hurts even the fourth time.
positive;Mainly the film really revolves around the four-man team Spooner, Dr. Lanning, Dr. Susan Clavin and Sonny.
positive;what somehow interferes against the end, is the unconsequent kind and wise as the story tries to clarify questions.
positive;They use real Linux/Unix commands and only the GUI is totally foreign and great designed.
positive;But I also didn't find Al Pacino's acting performance as good as in the first part.
positive;"So much so that the ""playing performance"" of the computer-animated characters surpasses that of the real actors - a milestone in the motion capturing process!"
positive;He was at first unspectacular to look at and one didn't know exactly what to do.
negative;It's just a cut.
negative;You can't justify everything by the fact that the film has an appearance of irony.
negative;Conclusion: Lead-heavy desert drama with working approach, but little entertainment value.
positive;Febraur 2006 waiting for him...and here comes the mistake: she wears the clothes (red jacket, white sweater) from 2008/Valentine day and not from 2006/Valentine day, which she wore on that accident day.
negative;A thoroughly entertaining film for dreaming and questioning: In what time would I have liked to have lived?
positive;However, there is one thing that doesn't hurt the movie, but it still gets a little weaker: the violence.
positive;This, I think, could be seen as a kind of criticism of the outdated system of social institutions.
negative;5 out of 10 points
positive;Wild-absurder genre mix, which convinces with an ingenious staging and coolness on full length.
negative;The knowledgeable reader is of course aware that the woman breaks at the gulf of former elegance and present poverty.
positive;That is called by principle Armageddon definitely is not as unrealistic as many think, but rather of the details, which, however, must certainly seem unrealistic in such a delicate mission.
positive;after his best performance.
negative;1) The best scenes were seen from various film previews, whether from cinema or TV!
positive;He's a celebrated hero.
positive;These films awaken an aggressive potential in me, which sometimes lets me run the shower over my back.
positive;That's how much I haven't felt since Halloween and that thing from another world.
positive;"This black comedy really hits ""the quality"" of the Hollywood comedy that's been running lately."
positive;Very authentic through the real recordings of the Eichmann process.
positive;"""The Great Gatsby"" was filmed again, this time according to Baz-Luhrmann's recipe."
positive;"The movie ""raise your voice"" was awesome!"
positive;I don't know how Nolan can do it, but he keeps getting the last thing out of Hans Zimmer.
positive;Incredibly good and crazy funny.
positive;It's the fact that even in such a bad situation, life should be tasted until the end.
positive;If you think I've looked at it and then make your own judgment.
positive;"Above all the scene in the car dealership, where Sam and your boss talked about cars and then the dialogue â€€œ and this curvesâ€œâ€œ where of course the camera pans out clearly to Carly ;-) I also found it a little pity that Megatron/Shockwave, one for my relations, had a rather short appearance and the fight of the two, as it should be, could have been better (more I don ́t betray now)."
positive;Just awesome and soo romantic.
negative;Actually an exciting story based on a true story!
negative;Han mourned for his son, I was also taken a little.
negative;The next movie, please!
positive;Whose time clock reaches zero, dies immediately, who has endless time, lives infinitely long.
negative;"""Psycho"" was not significant for Alfred Hitchcock's relatively normal career."
negative;And somehow I won't get rid of the feeling that the screenwriters were doing just that.
positive;One of them is to handle a lucrative business, and another is to take care of it.
positive;So yesterday Rush Hour 3 (in Austria he started already a day earlier) and must say I am thrilled.
positive;The last one, as a director, does everything right.
positive;Ernst, starkly hard and convincingly the action runs off in the rather small, but sufficient circle of persons.
positive;That just paid off fantastically.
negative;The fact that filmmakers have to condescend to such a low level is incomprehensible to me, the story with the baby is added (the one mutant wants to eat it at all costs).
negative;You can study them, memorize them, look at them inquiringly and will probably never guess the solution of the RÃ¤tsel.
positive;actually I rather cry watching movies and I usually avoid German films on Australian television, but here you can laugh warmly (go to Transylvania ?)
positive;Rosa von Praunheim is known as a filmmaker rather shrill, provocative, political - in any case always self-actor par excellence with a tendency to shock a angry public.
positive;Did the movie disintegrate me?
negative;He's just gonna be nice anyway....
positive;Jones, however, plays his prison warter even a bit more crazy than the joker could be.
negative;I expected a lot more, I looked at the movie with a friend and we really liked the grudge, then you come around the movie yes not around, found that was no horror!!!!!!
negative;Geena Davis just plays badly and the dialogues are mostly embarrassing and also bad.
positive;how that sounds...he is bought^^) but the carrying width, the sequence of this masterpiece I was not aware of.
positive;An accident, a stylish camera perspective from a flying wheel cap. Marc Forster created a visual monster with his film Stay.
positive;I swear on my mother's life: this film had reached 9 out of 10 rating points at filmstarts!
positive;As far as history is concerned.
positive;The film is clearly horror.
negative;But the story itself is really very thin and the action unfortunately only solid, because this repeats itself a little and is not very exciting.
positive;"He is by no means a time travel film in the traditional sense, since actually no one actually ""travels through time""."
positive;The Somali men can penetrate up to the bridge.
positive;"For example, ""Charlie Harper"" quote (Charlie Harper): ""8 Mile is the best hip hop movie.The film of 50 cents is just bad."""
positive;Finally, of course, the film is also a bitter warning to the totally overlaid owners of the leadership days of the investment industry.
positive;I live in Ireland and here the film by Stiller implicated humor was accepted almost consistently very positively, because there is no language barrier.
positive;I personally felt the movie itself, but above all the humor as very refreshing - it is not comparable with today's, far too many Hollywood-Klamauk-comdies, about which I could never laugh.
positive;"I was also surprised that she reacted to the fantasy world and its forms; nevertheless, this film captured me."
positive;You always follow with tension what happens as the closest.
negative;Unfortunately, camera settings, speed, cuts etc. are typical, they are used in every better action film, one can see here curse of the Caribbean, Braveheart, Highlander, Lord of the Rings etc. Only the first seuquence with the â€žEberâ€ stands out here.
positive;Conclusion: Probably the best comic film of all time.
positive;Fack Ju GÃ¶hte is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
negative;That's my opinion.
positive;The violence here, however, comes about a much more severe over, it seems real, and not as exaggerated as with Ichi (where even the overly hard raping scenes are realized by unreal dividing).
positive;It doesn't look like those movies.
negative;From Fleischer's film, it is difficult to see whether he worships or detests the genre and its references, whether his film is supposed to be a recreation or an exposure of offset pieces such as â€žharter Copâ€œ, â€žungezügelter Gangsterbossâ€œ, â€žFemme fataleâ€œ, â€žTommy Gun shootingsâ€œ, â€žMafia conflictsâ€œ,â€¦[...]The characters disappear behind their Cel Shading look[...]Ryan Gosling's valiuminÃ¶se acting has better suited Nicolas Winding Refnsâ€žDriveâ€œ[...]The chemistry between Gosling and Emma Stone?
negative;(If even Americans have to reload times, one naturally has to wait so long.)
positive;"Compared to the thematically not indisputable ""Operation: Kingdom"" (2007), in which the American investigators in Saudi Arabia clearly and plentifully poignantly show up with their technical possibilities, ""The man who never lived"" gives a much more differentiated picture and saves himself patriotic space."
positive;Here a gag rides at the next and boredom never occurs, because the situations are simply too crazy.
positive;Those who don't like the genre will not like this movie by the way.
positive;also absolutely recommended as an actor.
positive;"For the first half to three quarters of an hour, I thought, ""What did you do here?"""
positive;Therefore 9/10
negative;I just watched the movie because of Elisha Cuthbert, because I'm a fan of her.
positive;Landscapes, cities, connected glaciers or even the planet Krypton itself: Everything just seems fantastic and is a pure feast for all Sci-Fi/Fantasy lovers.
positive;Second floor, meeting room 2.
negative;Orlando Bloom looks like already mentioned above understaffed, and can not really unfold in his role.
negative;Is there a certain level of terrorism being satisfied here?
positive;Ben Affleck simply has no equal moments from the script, but delivers solidly what is required of him.
positive;My friends and friends also liked the movie all the time!
positive;Also this part is funny again!
positive;A movie you should like to watch with the family.
positive;none
positive;I saw Narnia today, and I have to say it knocked me down!
positive;But not only the main actor shines, also the supporting rolls are occupied up to the smallest very well.
positive;So not like other boring naturdokus but better really great.
positive;I found the scene with the US flag quite funny - let's be honest, even a blind one would have realized that the scene was not meant to be serious, let alone patriotic!
positive;1a action movie!
positive;"I can only recommend the film;-)"
positive;An experience for every Marvel-Comic fan.
negative;The only positive thing you can mention is the technical implementation and the darker optics.
positive;When I'm big, I want to be so cool.
positive;However, this did not break any trigger on the contrary.
positive;Naomi Watts' role is remarkable.
positive;Darcys, who find each other only over many detours, both as rich, romantic love story, as well as satirical society sport.
positive;this movie is one of my favorite felles he is genjal
negative;"I like the ""old"" Spiderman movies a lot."
positive;I'd watch it again it's an entertaining movie you can watch with children too
positive;But if you take a closer look, they make sense.
positive;We had everything necessary for a movie night, chips, cola, pocket cups.
negative;If you feel like this movie, I also recommend the fan program of Fips Asmussen.
positive;The authors master the balancing act between self irony and a certain seriousness.
negative;In order to show what 3D can do, scenes have been trimmed on it and they appear in 3D cinema probably straightios.
positive;It should be said that this was really imaginative and almost brilliantly implemented.
negative;I've never seen a movie where the most important characters are about 80% (!
positive;In order to understand the film one would probably have to be older, but the cuddly and witty figures might even amuse the smallest, even if some scenes are more brutal, than used by other animation films, to be portrayed.
negative;An absolutely realistic representation of today's mainstream society.
positive;The film is a musical or rather a scary one.
negative;I, too, can see relatively little of this thing or even take it with me.
negative;The aliens are blöd, fall for every trick and serlber doesn't bother them.
positive;"A movie that goes back to ""finds Nemo"" and ""Ice Age"", super funny, better than last ""Heaven and Chicken""."
positive;==References====External links==
negative;Well, you can still see... 5/10
positive;Too bad I also found that Gary Oldman doesn't give you as much scenes as you want to see.
positive;Conclusion: Painful drama, sensitively played and distressingly close to the reality!
positive;From beginning to end well thought out, and provided with an interesting and friendly resolution.
positive;Wonderful characters and interesting stories.
positive;a film between the big cinema and the big boredom.
positive;The best actor in this movie is, I think, McDarmied as Dath Sidios.
positive;How much love can you give?
positive;Like it is in life.
positive;Who cares if it is painted or painted?
negative;"Sa were his interviews e.g. also during the World Cup, while in ""The Team"" players and functionaries were interviewed only after the World Cup."
positive;An all-round envelope, as it stands in the book.
positive;documentary, without compulsion for the sacrifice without condemnation or hypocritical understanding for the doings.
negative;Then part will be more faithful to the book, which is due to mistakes made in the 6th century.
positive;In a few movies, so much ammo is shot.
negative;So his character Deadshot gets most of the screen time.
positive;"Nathan's Hybris comes before the case; thus, the typical American, Old Testament motif of Guilt & SÃ1⁄4hne is well integrated."
positive;But to accuse the film of softening would be wrong.
positive;But over the plot of the individual stories you have to look away, if it does not affect you.
positive;This film shines in everyone and is with Inception the best work of Christopher Nolan so far.
positive;Thanks to the synchronous voice I'm always used to by Edward Norton, you should have given him the roll that would have fit perfectly to the lead role.
positive;Great story (it's clear), grief, joy, heartache, love, cravings, talk, betrayal and consolation.
positive;On the paper, the story reads like every second horror film: a lonely group, dark forests, a demarcation, the obligatory wooden hut, mystical symbols and an unknown threat in the darkness.
negative;Does Gru actually abandon his whole family plus Minions because of an unknown brother?
negative;Against this strip, part 2 was a masterpiece... just because he didn't take himself as embarrassingly serious as the hilarious third part.
negative;Who made the casting!!
positive;"It is a ""typical"" Chinese film, but it comes without many of the typical annoying characteristics."
positive;...these Asians.
negative;"1-2 Spider Man does not jump ""out of the picture"" anymore."
positive;One thing is clear to the group that they were ratted out and that the spoiler is still among them.
positive;A good movie, I can recommend to any warmest: 8 points !
positive;Beautiful that such a great film was given to humanity.
positive;The music is wonderful, the story is wonderful and the characters are wonderful.
positive;The duo bulges and bald through the film in verbal high form, it is their opposite, co- and co-participation, from which â€žA Game of Shadowsâ€œ draws its drive even if he divides it from it and transfers it on a humorous or violent way to their reunification.
negative;+ You can see a little philosophy in the movie.
negative;Conclusion: for once look quite ok, but that's all.
negative;Here probably both money and time have been missing, there is a gross counterpart to the â€žHobbitâ€œ, Jackson would probably have converted this topic into a five-parter.
negative;message of the film still arrives
positive;"Space again seems infinitely large, dark, cold and threatening, and it was also great that the ""Covenant"" never made contact with Earth, so that they completely awakened the feeling of being completely alone in space."
positive;a film for eternity, just by the black-and-white style so haunting, gripping, traveling along.
negative;So save the card.
positive;You must have seen the movie!
positive;I myself am in the dance club and therefore cannot understand why this film has such a bad criticism: but in Germany there is freedom of speech and thought and that is also good!
positive;Hats off.
negative;so 4 oscars and so many good criticisms must nevertheless simply vote.
positive;A better director than Villneuve would not have been able to find it.
positive;Well...from a point in the movie I knew who Charlie was but that didn't make the movie bad in my opinion.Nearly, I won't describe this point here as I would otherwise take a break from the movie to the readers of this review.
positive;"Read my review of ""rush everything for victory"" below..."
positive;"Also the film strongly reminds of ""Nausicaä from the valley of the winds""."
positive;A lot of action and the movie lets you think about how to treat others yourself or even animals.
positive;But otherwise especially Naomi Watts and little David Dorfman make a wonderful figure in the strip Very worth seeing
positive;A tiny, scrapy motor boat takes it up with a huge, fully loaded, modern container ship.
positive;The temporal arrangement of the events in the film roughly coincides with the reality, such as the assassination of Frank Rosenthal, which took place in October 1982.
positive;and HAMMERARTIGEN IMAGINES.
positive;The film is truly a pearl of the genre.
negative;I guess it's a matter of taste in spite of Johnny Depp...
positive;That the Untold Story, with which was still advertised in the trailer, is simply missing here and for the 2.
positive;Thank you, Malick.
positive;Actor: Rebecca Hall, Jason Bateman, Joel Edgerton Director: Joel Edgerton Year: 2015 Rental: Paramount Pictures Duration: 108 min FSK: from 12 years
positive;The fact that the movie had no happy ending and became dramatic, I personally don't like it anymore, but of course I don't let it go negatively into my rating either :-).
positive;"With this complete package, the film does not have to hide from reasons like ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and can keep up without any problems."
positive;Until the end, you never know if Johnny and Co.
positive;It is the first animated film that is really worse in German than in English.
negative;But hope dies, as you know, the last time...
negative;But the animation of the silly jumping zombies on speed is more than powerful.
positive;Not only the melancholy (perfectly encased by an outstanding Robert De Niro), which slips like a red thread in the film and builds up the showdown at the end, but the potential, which motivates to think and shows how currently the problem is still today, make this film an incomparable experience.
negative;Certainly 50% of the movie are pure waiting scenes in which NOTHING...nothing at all happens except a bit of mime play.
positive;"""Pulp Fiction"" on the other hand - huddled and teased by the reviews - seems disgusting to me... funny, doesn't it?"
positive;In this film, one or the other stage can flow.
positive;That is why the mass murderer is allowed to play the piano - because it corresponds to the facts, and not to provoke.
positive;World War II determined the place of residence to which regiment one has come!
negative;Sam Raimi's exaggerated humor has already been seen in dance of the devil 1-3 and in this movie he seems to be funny as well.
positive;It may be that the ach so great Akiva Goldsman has won a few prizes, but that doesn't make him disfigure this incredible trilogy from my point of view.
positive;Thank you
positive;Somehow an unpleasant feeling develops in the body, one does not know where it comes from, or what causes it.
negative;"The film is definitely too long; it would have been better."
positive;It's now popcorn cinema with too much image and sound power.
positive;Well, I liked the movie, too.
positive;Super performance from the young actress that kills Eli, I don't perceive her role, and believe that she's really a vampire girl...
positive;In addition, Naomi Watts and Jack Black, their characters, gave a lot of deep and prisanz.
negative;Compassion, sympathy or similar does not arise.
positive;On the other hand, most characters with their trash-attitude are rather unsympathetic.
positive;So much fun with the new Disney figure With nice greeting The Lord
negative;I'll take it for a second: Hand-made action: very nice.
negative;Conclusion: If you are not exactly a fan of boring and lengthy films without many dialogues, you will already regret having borrowed this film after 20 minutes.
negative;The story does not get in motion, as it is told very boring.
negative;"Dear readers, dear readers, ""The construction"" has unmasked me without fail, because this film does not create any tension and is boring."
positive;After Heat the best movie by Michael Mann, which means as much as the second best movie ever.
positive;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
positive;There is a short breather on the freighter where Gerry Lane gets his mission communicated.
positive;If that hadn't been, you'd have had a great movie.
positive;First of all, I have to contradict allegations that the optical brilliance of the film would overshadow the story of Roy and Alexandria.
positive;He was moving because it REALLY happened and because you get what it took to overcome it to implement such a plan into reality.
negative;And that, although I like to watch Gladiator and currently find Beowulf pretty good.
positive;That should be pretty much the movie you least expected of David Schwimmer â€ , the man seems to make like Ben Affleck.
negative;Since I had approached the film without great expectations, I was not disappointed either. I only knew John Clay from the schsau players and I only recognized him later.
positive;Avengers 1 =Bounty /Breaky Action Avengers 2 =Bounty /Breaky Action Iron Man 3 =Bounty /Breaky Action Amazing Spiderman 2= Ok / Jamie Fox= Good ...
positive;I liked it, the second part was rather weak, but this one feels pretty good to me.
positive;In short: Whom in this film not the tears come, either did not understand him or no heart.
positive;I'm surprised that no comentars have yet been made into this master's throw.
positive;There were many good, new and creative ideas with built-in, the dialogues all worked super, seemed human and were partly also super funny (clearly the funniest Star Wars movie), also the character writings were, as I said, absolutely great but in principle the movie is then only once more Episode 4 and that unheard me a little, because really almost identical all plot points were reused from A new hope and the movie even seems a bit overloaded in the finale.
positive;The film is very intriguing from the beginning to the end and with exciting endings.
positive;And he exceeded my expectations by far!
positive;For the whole family:)
negative;I give the movie 2 points, only for the action and special effect scenes.
positive;Of course it is not the Bad Lieutenant of Abel Ferrara ... so what?
negative;That's great!!!
positive;There will certainly be many trying to unlock this movie to get to its core, its statement.
negative;So nice this basic idea, so in the future the ultimate result.
positive;And that's what Panem 2 absolutely does.
positive;a really successful horror strip that has an exciting and fast-paced history to tell. the soundtrack, the characters and the shock sequences are used and convincingly.
positive;Because it's unlikely to have anything to do with life and, last but not least, you just can't imagine that something like this could ever happen.
positive;In the big and whole the storyline turns first around the two with a lot of humor and a bit of teen romance.
positive;I'm impressed and looking forward to the DVD at the end of the year.
positive;In addition, kate Beckinsale is also real Ge*l
negative;The action scenes are well represented but that doesn't make this movie any good at all.
positive;On top of that: the â€œI want the truth / you cannot tolerate the truth at all!â€œ dialogue scene of Cruise and Nicholson would probably be one of the most famous film scenes of all time.Conclusion: Captivating court spectacle with humor, powerful star cast and sparkling dialogues!
positive;The Berlinale, which just ended under the jury chair of director Paul Verhoeven, could be happy if at least a few such gripping and high-quality films such as â€žElleâ€ were present in the competition.
positive;This tightrope walk will be scale and challenge for the new term under Craig
positive;The only thing I really have to do has actually nothing to do with the movie itself.
negative;So everything remains a bit one-sided.
positive;Only one of them is still alive and with his last breaths he lets Tuco know that the treasure is buried in a cemetery in Sad Hill, while the blond finds the name on the tombstone.
positive;The narrow ridge is a masterpiece floating in its own dimension, which seems to be unattainable.
negative;Lots of flat girlie talk, hardly any action.
positive;But that doesn't remain their only problem on board.
positive;The dialogues are precisely the strength of the film and by no means boring.Also, every actor (especially giant praise to Christoph Walz) adapted his role.
positive;Anti political, cheerful and life-affirmed.
positive;A great movie with an even better Nicolas Cage,to admire in one of his last really good movies.
negative;Generally it is a movie that was much too overhypt that does not do justice.
positive;Even if some side plots would not have been useful and there is a bit too much in Sci-Fi the actors can convince and especially once again a good ¶sewicht.
positive;Beginners is a beautiful representative of the genre Tragikomödie, who knows how to use both sides of this subgenre very well with great acting performances.
positive;He invites to lonely reflection and philosophical discussion with friends.
positive;As was said very correctly in the recession, probably the best possible one was brought out of the story!
positive;Michael Mann is a thoroughly perfectionist filmmaker who really doesn't leave anything to chance.
positive;"In addition, one has to note that the film is filmed from the perspective of Friedrich or Albrecht, not from that of an enthusiastic National Socialist (which is similar to ""Der Untergang"", which is filmed from the perspective of Traudl Junge and therefore Hitler is very human at first)."
negative;Incredible action long-lived nothing special.. Craig had no bug in
positive;Nevertheless, the fate is very harsh, one unfortunately also does not experience what drives the parents to do just this, why they live like this.
positive;But as B*rny already said, it's actually pointless, I'm going to get the Japanese as well as everything started.
positive;I do not think that is the case.
negative;It is not about the Mafia and their way of life, but about a few idiots who carry out a raid and beat over the streaks.
positive;You can find a whole series of interesting new aspects: This begins with the realm of the dead.
positive;A few Oskars and oscarnominations romp around.
negative;Right with all kinds of problems.
positive;Due to the variety of characters, some remain a bit pale.
positive;What more can you expect from the movie?
negative;That's how the rabbit is dead.
positive;so bleak that it seems as if it would be the two men no matter whether they are in danger or not.
positive;I've been watching the movie several times!
negative;It's too bad.
positive;The less you know about the movie, the more fun you have.
negative;Melissa McCarthy is probably supposed to represent something like the female counterpart to Zach Galifianakis, and therefore, not lady-like at all, can really hit the shit (and not only verbally, but also literally).
positive;Unfortunately, I must say, I thought the end was a bit too bad.
positive;The sounds naturally do their rest.
negative;Yesterday the film was shown in SAT1.
positive;"A company filled with property, which of course was ""only"" right by its basic attitude."
positive;The film is also acting on a good level, especially Shia LeBeouf is particularly convincing as a charismatic and sympathetic boy from next door.
negative;Complete dullness, with which also no mood comes over.
positive;There's a new joke on every corner.
negative;The leader of the defense troops of Xander is treated in the film as if the viewer already knew a lot about him and the hero groups act with him, as if they would personally meet him several times in the film.
positive;The movie is just awesome.The movie is just for shooting.When I first looked at it in me I thought what is it for a horny movie so I really don't know why the movie is rated so badly I think you should vote.The Dukes are just awesome.They can drift so perfectly so that everyone can be comforted of that.Your MUST watch the movie absolutely simply hammer I say.
negative;it snores, hissssssssssssssssssssssssssssss and rumbles from all corners and so there is a real firework in the match with the optics.
positive;And that's not negative at all.
positive;Positively, I have to highlight here all actors who did a great job, especially Jennifer Lawrence (who looked really hot) and Chris Pat.
positive;But the star of the old Haudegen is clearly Harrison Ford.
positive;The film has tied me up very much, the psycho-effects have been very successful and the end also fits perfectly.
negative;Which is as fantastic as OZ, so can not be distracted from the boring story.
positive;Film music, setting and equipment are neat.
negative;So guys, I'm really surprised that there are some of them who like the movie.
negative;A children's movie!
positive;Also the acting achievements are outstanding.
positive;Why was he so powerful when he could hardly move more and was apparently darker than an earthworm?
positive;"All in all, a very exciting thriller that doesn't have to hide from role models like ""Hitcher""!"
positive;Outstanding is the end of the film with the march of clones and the fairytale wedding of Anakin and PadmÃ©.
positive;The worst is of course that the supposed main character Steven Segal disappears from the film after 30 minutes â€ , so one forgives also the plump opening sequence in which he brutally storms a villa with his team.
positive;Here just to speak of solid, would hardly be fair to the film.
positive;I thought the movie was really funny, to laugh at.
negative;To Die For is a media satire.
negative;Unfortunately, they've already seen them in the trailer.
positive;The soldier James Ryan is the most brutal and bloody anti-war film ever made.It's the hottest war movie of all time, and it's where the gutters and body parts fly.
positive;The 3d of course also contributed to this.
positive;So I have to say, the film music and also the plot of the first movie I liked a tick better, but also in the 2.
negative;The can still be so trashy and still say all they are grandiose.
positive;The actors are all great.
negative;There are much better KifferkomÃ¶dia.
negative;That with such a craft disaster even actors can do nothing anymore is logical.
negative;One week after the assassination of Dallas, the film tells of the shock of the President's murder, of the widow's grief, of her difficulty in persuading her ideas of a dignified cause and of her loneliness.
positive;Not, however, here: A true fireworks of wit, charm, insidious and rough Bavarian humor, a successful game with clichés and unmistakable originality.
negative;This film sounded good from the content text, but does not meet my expectations.
positive;A pathetic finale can just be prevented by the purposefully timed demolition of a large speech.
positive;It's not one of these 08/15 movies where you're being undressed.
positive;9/10
negative;The highly acclaimed film is unfortunately a defamation, the dialogues and the whole script come to hear therefore, often the text is no more than a collection of anecdotes.
negative;What comes out then is a shockingly ingenuous, relatively boring patchwork, which at the end seems completely overhappy and actually only shows a row of scenes that do not form a unity and no dynamics among themselves.
negative;But it's precisely when employees are no longer loyal - when they're about to throw out.
positive;Now to the movie.
positive;Here, too, the credibility is due to the outstanding acting achievements.
positive;Although the director fulfills the wish that Ofelia may live on and this probably in a better world, than in the backlit and miserly also not with the appropriate pictures to it, but it quite clearly outweighed with me the sadness about the death of the girl.
positive;The Others is for me one of the best movies that have ever seen.
positive;So far no splatterfilm has taught me the FÃ1⁄4rcht .
positive;In the end, they are only victims, even though the abominations commit.
positive;Daughter Frederica (Morfydd Clark) is also to be married well.
positive;"""The Revenge of the Sith"" is already more than strong because, in return for the other parts, he so consistently concludes with his figures."
positive;Despite small swaggers at the beginning and at the end, it is nevertheless the great action and the incredible thirsty and dirty style that convinces.
negative;But if you really turn your head off, then you get a wonderfully filmed prime example served, how you now make out of a four-page script an evening-filling spectacle, which is really only suitable for people from sixteen and up, because the violence is already very drastic (but always somehow good-loune-mÃ1⁄4ig) shown.
positive;"""Zero sense!"
positive;There is no introduction.
positive;"""What is an ocean if not a variety of drops"" After second sighting I must correct the 4 stars upwards."
positive;The film leans very closely on the novel.
positive;the nature writes halt the most beautiful stories
negative;Henry Cavill is solid again in both roles.
negative;In addition, Natalie Portman touches the horny Ashton Kutcher with her performance in close proximity to every scene, which does not do the movie any good at all.
positive;I can recommend this film series without hesitation ( all three).
negative;A few gags fold and sit down and I'd like to see most of them get along with the movie, too - but the highlight of the series certainly doesn't put it there.
positive;If an evaluation is already given, then a short conclusion at the end of each review is desirable, at which each individual deducted / won point is explained.
positive;"Then they flee into the fire desert, where they find new dangers, among other things the ""netten"" Cranks, and have to find their way there."
positive;How to cut flags, how to sing and dance.
positive;In the USA, Chbosky's novel is considered a classic of youth literature.
positive;A lot of jokes at the current band and really good acting performance.
positive;And make his own judgment.
positive;"For a long time it was back that I watched ""Braveheart"" on TV, and now I thought it would be time again."
positive;The complete work Last Night, however, is original and coherent.
positive;The little touch to the cult film is probably missing only because he did not want to achieve this goal at all.
positive;You almost get a little scared of her, just as she scolds and curses and eats.
positive;So powerful and complex!
negative;But he does not.
positive;But tobey Maguire wasn't the right Spiderman in my opinion, but he did his job really well.
positive;Very strong action film that gets more and more moving.
negative;On every frame of the film you notice that the work is simply cheap.
negative;But now to the film... You don't need much to say about the plot, because in this film it's almost exclusively about transferring situation to your own experiences etc.
positive;Part â€žDogvilleâ€œ, which will be called â€œWashingtonâ€œ, and will soon be finished, and 2007 in the cinema.
positive;So I looked at the movie a few days ago and I have to say: the movie is just awesome.
positive;"Now it is called ""everything a matter of time"", and Curtis did not give up Bill Nighy in an important supporting role this time either."
negative;This is artistically made virtuoso and quite exciting.
positive;You just can't take movie starts seriously anymore.
positive;All figures have depth and everything is authentic and coherent - so is the story!
positive;After 96 Hours, Drag Me to Hell, District 9, Hangover and Paranormal Activity, Zombieland is the sixth film this year that can easily be shot with large-scale productions ala Terminator 4 or Transformers 2.
negative;The (sometimes naked!!!!!)
positive;The anticipated computer effects and tricks are just perfect.
positive;This is perhaps the only illogical scene ..
positive;FAZIT: A quite simple film about dreams, family, bond and responsibility.
positive;The beautiful music does its rest.
negative;For a well-kept cinema evening the black-humored stripe has to offer just too little despite some good instances.
positive;And Richard Nixon, in his encounter with the artist, whom he had previously annoyed as quickly as possible, suddenly becomes a close, curious and forgotten human being.
positive;"This is the only way films like ""2001 - Odyssey in Space""."
positive;One by one, they marry an Arab, a Jew, and a Chinese.
negative;At â€œMan in Black 3â€œ, most of it fumes without effect, just like the 3D effect.
negative;Nothing half and nothing whole and also no film that does a lot for that very reason.
positive;"In the documentary ""The Act of Killing"" by Joshua Oppenheimer, a man named Anwar Congo is interviewed."
positive;However, since this is skillfully implemented and is filled with so many surprise problems and you can't foresee anything, this is actually no problem.
negative;In the two films, the monkeys have still fought for their right to freedom and also proved that you are the better people, in this film the monkeys are subjected again and survive only by luck and the inability of the humans.
positive;Because what the movie feels about the Trekkie is about the following: a ship comes from the future into the time of Kirk's teens and causes a catastrophe that I don't want to carry out, just: this catastrophe leads to a completely new, own timeline and to a completely new Star Trek universe.
positive;So take a handkerchief with you and think about the massage...
positive;Absolutely gripping story about diamond exploitation in Africa.
positive;In addition carefully made backdrops and a very meaningful camera guide - the ambience is simply harmonious, it should be no documentation but a cinema film.
positive;Then why would he have such a huge success?
positive;I don't know if such a movie would still be possible today: - Without 3D - Without computer animations without end - Without action Too bad that the movie went out so completely without Oscar (that was a cover-up).
positive;It also makes more sense in terms of content.
positive;"But ""COLD PREY"" is - as I have to admit in a scrambled way - correct... Regardless of whether ""CALTE BETTER"", ""CALTE BETTER"" or ""CALTE OPFER"" were selected to attract viewers - by looking up, I have now hopefully translated the Norwegian original title as ""FREIWILD""."
positive;You can become friends with the fact that Happy Feet is actually an animated musical comedy and not a reddish digital bravostück a la Shrek u.a. you will be really well entertained.
negative;So I find one look and as the best on DVD cinema is just too expensive for that.
positive;That's a good mood!
negative;I saw the DVD yesterday.
negative;Conclusion: Sometimes a bit twisted comedy, but enough for entertaining pleasure!
positive;All the parties involved must nevertheless live with their decisions and get their effects in all bounds to feel.
positive;"Attention spoilers; but I still have to get rid of one thing to the story."
positive;"For everyone who can think a bit further than ""what do we eat tomorrow"" a probably unforgettable movie!"
positive;This is certainly not a coincidence, but who should be blamed for it?
positive;I'll have to see you again at the Oscars.
negative;"I'm not one of those who literally get excited about every little bit of logic in a movie, but ""Source Code"" is a single number of exactly those."
positive;Acting convincing, especially Hanno Koffler.
negative;"Don't... don't even pay for ""nothing, let's do it."""
negative;too high to go really deep, if this word game is allowed.
positive;But now I got the uncut version for my birthday and was a little disappointed that there are only minimal differences to the normal version and they are only at the beginning of the film or directly at the captivity and a slightly different credits.
negative;"very beautiful pictures of nature - from the simple and sparsely populated landscapes of the north and from the highlands of Afghanistan; the moods created by it are impressive."
positive;10 points out of 10!
positive;Russell Crowe, on the other hand, can't quite convince so, which is mainly due to his limited screen presence.
negative;A fun and exciting experience, certainly for 4-10 year old children, because many colorful funny little animals experience funny things in a big colorful funny world, for the rest of the viewers probably the worst sequence of film history: ++SPOILER++ All of them braided, because water comes, aaah, danger of life, then the water comes, somehow not so bad, bit of Noah's ark, blubb flows away the water, zack and where the water has flowed, suddenly Mammuts come from.
positive;More information on my blog:
positive;Due to the fact that the director repeatedly hits the hook in the Burleske in tragic scenes, he keeps the film from slipping into the pathetic.
positive;I find the movie full horny so who has still not seen the must watch the absolutely ma
positive;And although I often don't like movies that have a shorter run time than 120 minutes, this movie with a run time of 105 minutes is an exception.
positive;I still think that the proportions would have been better suited if the first half of the film had been better.
positive;Otherwise, the film represents a refreshing change to the American uniqueness, to which Magnolia belongs.
positive;Unfortunately, I missed the irony of this time a little, as she presented charles dickens excellent.
negative;This is not the case at first.
positive;Even those who wish themselves a bitch war or a plot Ã la Rosamunde Pilcher, will not be served.
positive;Overall, I recommend watching the movie, because it's just super exciting and better than I imagined.
negative;Dance of the devil 2 is bigger, faster, funny, but still not as good as its predecessor, who to a certain extent also shows up again in this movie.
negative;However, the film does not get a place in my film shelf for eternity.
positive;This is exactly the only point of criticism of me, I think the film would have been a bit longer to play in the future, but it would probably have become scarce with the scenes from 1955.
positive;Finally, I would like to give the people who always come to the cinema room only when the movie already runs ten minutes, (as I hate them) I would like to give a tip with the way.
positive;here the conflict death aid or not,.. I see here rather the repetition between self-determination and right or better OBLIGATION and forced to live.
positive;What raises the romantic side of the film especially about other genre representatives is the incredible authenticity.
positive;Either you can start with these slow pictures, or you think it's boring.
positive;The brisante of it: The order comes from the south states, the fort belongs to the northern states.
positive;That's what a Star Wars Sequil is supposed to look like.
positive;Good against evil there have always been.
positive;Rather, the film lets the feelings rise from your own heart.
positive;Romeo and Juliet.
positive;here have created a modern classic, which in my opinion belongs to the absolute best, what Hollywood has ever produced.
positive;One can of course discuss whether the film has become too lengthy or too little of Milk's life illuminated, but for me this was not a criticism.
negative;To Gugucks: I can only say about myself that I am not an iceberg and I hate Mario Barth.
positive;I still think it is nice to get at the end a short scene to the further life after the war from the persons.
positive;FSK 16 would have been enough.
positive;:P
negative;The installation of Jake's siblings is also questionable.
positive;Conclusion: Lets defintively beat hearts higher, especially with players of Warcraft, since the movie performs incredibly many details, but it is also good for viewers who have no connection to the video game.
positive;In the stark contrast to the rough legs > Wolferine<, which he engulfed in X-Men, he enchants, as well as in >Kate&Leopold<.
positive;The whole ambience of the film fits perfectly with the time it plays.
positive;The event is still reinforced by the famous score of Howard Shore, he manages to support Fintcher's nightmareous images skilfully.
positive;This concept is completely up... so the viewer simply has to think his part (and is also inspired by the visual language) in some scenes.
positive;Partially, the film gave me a lot of feedback, which is quite rare in movies.
positive;Again to the cinema visit we were in Osnabrück in the cinema and how the film was finished, guess what, Greenpeace in front of the door and distributed notes why got out and so far I found nciht so great.
negative;In part 3 it is called without if and but: Camera on it.
positive;The film is so good that you can empathize with the actors.
positive;It's a great plot.
positive;"Where I draw this from my rational thinking and last year's heavily-runned debuff movies like ""Locke"" by Steven Knight or ""Nightcrawler"" by Dan Gilroy."
positive;Conclusion: Atmospherically top, with a lot of style, good actors and complex story, where you can lose the overview - a film that probably gets better at the second sight, as one probably missed a lot at the first sight.
negative;It kind of reminds me of Playdoh Knetmasse.
positive;Octave is a really sensitive artist who, under his superficial way, walks through society with a awake glance, and ultimately breaks apart from the fact that he has to sell himself with his talents as a media whore to completely banal and profitable managers - their medium power motor for the boring advertising advertising worlds Ã¡ la Madone (Danone & co), which program our society - so that we as stupid consumers do not start thinking ourselves.
negative;Woody Allen, look at Oba (= down)!
positive;Jason Statham obviously had a lot of fun and I still like him in what he's doing.
positive;Yes, on the second and third times you can see loving details.
negative;What a grandiose film would this have been, if not everything had been staged so predictablely?
positive;At the beginning you know exactly as much as the characters: nothing.
positive;Very successful film and moving end.
positive;A film for all who do not pay too much attention to a logical action.
positive;Nikki Reed is now my favorite actress, how old were the two girls in the movie really...real 13???
positive;This will disappoint one or the other hardcore fan, but revives the franchise all the more.
positive;Above all, everyone wants to know whether there are still hungry games and whether Ketniss and peterÂ ́s child have to participate as everything improves or worsens.
positive;It certainly won't be my favorite movie but I think it could be one of the first really worth seeing movies in German film history.
negative;The plot is possibly somewhat inconspicuous until one realizes that always in the past is jumped.
positive;This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
negative;The group of hired killers, who kill in the name of a loom, reminds more of a fanatic cult.
negative;One would have to simply switch down a gear in many areas in order to be able to develop the story better.
positive;I don't really have a problem with violence, but if almost every extra or other who somehow crosses the path of the killer gang is brutally sent across the Jordan and actually two thirds of the murders only serve the show effect and not the action that is already abundantly weak.
positive;And I also find Charlotte's development successful.
negative;A bit more action would certainly not have been harmed, in order to portray the director's concern, the bodies/victim situation even more drastically.
positive;"Brad Pitt may be playing the role of his life here, especially as a ""young"" gray one is really overwhelmed by his performance, the Oscar would not have been deserved only because of the optics to play a small child in the body of an old man without which it slips into the ridiculous is not easy."
positive;Kevin Spacey was also great, although his role was a bit small, but still great, the other supporting actors Lawrence Fishburne, Aaaron Yoo and Liza Lapira were also very well cast.
positive;"Long not as kitschy as ""Walk the line"", although it was also very worth seeing."
positive;Simple but extremely effective!
positive;But there is a lot more behind it: I have to say that you have managed the brutality the times very real.
negative;Typical Kevin Costner movie, full of pathos and he's in the middle of it.
positive;"With the enemy even less draught is present, because one does not over the usual ""I am the boss and wants that and the"" Schema out - again unused potential."
positive;In addition, there are the characters, who are now all cults.
positive;Clint Eastwood shines once again here, this time in the role of prisoner Frank Morris, the head and organizer of the outbreak.
positive;And the funny snails, which always occur, are just the bruller!
negative;In between, a knife attack follows on the Nacbarin (then the half of the parents with children disappeared from the cinema), which moved the family to move!
positive;Have fun, who enjoys this fun!
negative;The main focus, however, is on the prehistory and this prehistory, which robs the film of all seriousness!
positive;I think she's not bad when I invite you there... :) So just stop by.
positive;"The verdict of Horrormagazin.de: ""Full hit!"
positive;I find this movie strong, because it is quite characterful, has a lot of fun and emotions in it.
positive;Again, parallels are drawn to what I have seen as appealing.
positive;"In the end, ""Heat"" is one of those very rare films, which can't be met by words, and whose full purpose unfolds only in one, if you have enjoyed it."
positive;A true classic.
negative;This naturally coincides with the fact that the Remaners play a much more important role than their subordinates in the neighboring planet.
positive;Definitely worth it!
positive;The film is almost a revelation in acting, because with one exception (Ioann Grufford, who is one of the worst misoccupations in recent years as Tony Blair), all the other actors perform excellently.
positive;The former flagship Sean Penn acts as a traumatized wreck as likeable as never and gives off a class hero.
positive;Those who want to watch cinematic cinematic cinematic entertainment should watch an American 0815 film and not go into a documentary.
positive;At the end Webb attracts then powerfully, tension and spectacle unite to an emotional mix.
negative;Angalina Jolie was too short, there were some nice chases and a totally senseless story.
positive;these films are so corresponding to the genre...
positive;Of course, many dialogues are AMERICAN-PATRIOTIC... But here it fits, at all corners and ends.
positive;I don't know.
positive;Through appropriate film music, individual scenes are supported in their effect on the viewer.
positive;Can only recommend to anyone to watch the movie.
negative;Too bad.
positive;Especially I find him so cool about cedric!!
negative;Of course, I didn't expect a film like War of the Gods to be 100% held to the mythology of the Greeks, but white-painted guys with plastic helmets, all of which look the same as Titans to sell... uiuiui...
negative;It is and remains all artificial in this movie, not just Ripley.
positive;But which are presented here, before all at the beginning, are just very good.
positive;So was in yesterday and must really say don't like fish horror but the movie was the hammer very cool made funny but also gross blood blood blood and blood !!
positive;08/15-Thriller according to Schema F were even then as now easier to consume.
positive;The verdict of the critics is mostly so low because the Lord of the Thieves is for children rather than for awakened ones.
positive;To the whole comes a successful score and the production can also be seen.
positive;I just got out of the movies and I'm still totally intoxicated and enchanted.
negative;In one word: very lame!
positive;Dreamy pictures, suspense until the end.
positive;Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has S.H.I.E.L.D.
positive;When the trailer always came to the film, I was already fascinated by the characters, unfortunately the money was missing at the time to go to the cinema.
positive;The whole movie is like a melody... it's high and deep, but above all, it's meaningful.
positive;Or by Jesse Ventura : I don't have time to bleed...!
negative;The actors have put themselves well into the roles and you could exactly feel what they felt.
positive;The movie was great!
positive;The film never sinks to the level of a serious drama, but scenes like the one where Jim just goes into his old room awaken memories of the old films and of earlier.
positive;Not much later he is bitten by the spider and then explores his new abilities.
positive;"(Only to hope that a sequel will appear;-))"
positive;The only one who stands out is Billy's sister Kathryn - but she alone has no chance of getting her brother out of the military system.
negative;There is no such thing as a story that is typical of the normal feature film, with a certain dramaturgy that takes you to another world.
negative;Oh, no, I was just reading, in L.A.
positive;However, there is quite a lot of tension.
positive;8/10
negative;Morgan's son to Poesy also completely beside it.
positive;Still NEVER I felt such feelings in a movie.One feels literally what is happening in the movie.
negative;Some scenes were constructed and the slapstick inlays went towards Klamauk.
positive;I looked at Lone Survivor yesterday already in the USA and am just overwhelmed!!
positive;The characters are magnificently cast down to the supporting roles.
positive;The kids play their roles perfectly.
negative;No strip you have to see, but fans of such Statham movies will get their money's worth.
positive;Hooper (or Spielberg) works a lot with light and this flicker from the TV looks intense.
positive;"Certainly ""Garden State"" was a slightly different calibre but ""the last kiss"" also has many stronger ones."
positive;:-)
positive;Only the scene with the ketamine is just stupid - that one might have done better after all.
negative;4.5 Stars of Filmstarts?!
negative;"I only recently saw a poster where this film was referred to: ""by the creators of â€žBad Neighborsâ€œ why should anyone know or specifically refer to this film as a reference?"
positive;Grandios!
positive;no gangster film can compete with scarface.
negative;There was potential, one would really have something to make of it.
positive;"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a very successful first string by Quentin Tarantino."
positive;Highly recommended to all HdR and Hobbit fans!
positive;I saw the movie yesterday in the sneak preview and wasn't exactly thrilled at the beginning, nothing special.
positive;The humor: For all gags brilliantly.
positive;What I was hoping for was also fulfilled.
positive;Exciting, unpredictable and entertaining the part is just because of its unused subject matter, so that OMNÃ-VOROS is recommended for all those who have a passion for hearty meals.
positive;John Goodman works in some places if his age just a little too unjointed for such a firefight.
negative;Instead of charmingly conjuring the rabbit out of the hat in the end, director Louis Leterrier chooses the cheapest variant.
positive;The film is exciting and interesting from the beginning to the end.
positive;But if you get involved in the resolution and think about it a little bit, it is really very interesting and sometimes takes a slightly different path.
positive;He never became one of the great ones in Hollywood but for that all the better.
positive;Really good movie!
positive;Add to that very good and appropriate music of the 80s and a political message.
positive;Like Lost Highway - a path without end.
positive;Friendly greeting.
negative;Above all, Cage says in a scene to Rose, which he came in touch with the blood of an alpha, and the mimics would therefore wish the soldiers would arrive at the beach.
positive;From a meaningless little journey, he makes the meaningless prehistory of what still follows.
positive;Nothing to me, nothing to you, Tim and his dog Struppi are on a scavenger hunt around the globe, on which he meets many funny people and experiences a lot of crazy things.
positive;Also the former overseer who lives with the blacks on Manderlay, who is also to be punished, finally the whites have worried, scolded for democracy, so the gangsters force themselves on GRACE order, all whites must swarm their face, and use the Negroes.
positive;Nope.
positive;Also the atmosphere of the City of God is wonderfully successful and carries the mood and the tension of the film to the end.
negative;"But the ""small"" differences (THE END!!)"
negative;After Templar Knights and Pirates Bruckheimer now jumps on the magic train alÃ¡ Harry Potter.
positive;Ponyo's father discovers her and takes her back to the bottom of the sea.
positive;Bravo!
negative;Most likely comparable to a slightly harder version of movies like Rush Hour 3 or GI Joe.
positive;The film was boring in the smallest second, it was very brutal.
positive;Really a really exciting thriller!
positive;The more brutal and unique, the better for business.
positive;The parallel between Joaquin and Johnny is also interesting, because both have lost a brother.
positive;The collar is on top, the toothpick sits in the corner of the mouth, the leather gloves sit and man thinks: that's how I want to be!
positive;9/10
positive;As Kevin Spacy, through the simplest answers, has held a mirror to the human being (Jeff Bridges), just madness.
positive;If you take the film, you should already know what you're getting involved with.
positive;But an overly cool one, which seems additionally involuntarily funny due to the equipment, the clothes at that time, hairstyles and faces.
positive;"Emma Roberts had already got to deal with school problems, precarious family situations and strange circles of friends in ""Palo Alto""."
positive;This time it is not the action in the actual sense in the foreground, but the family life or the past.
positive;"The British 60/70 football aura makes the whole thing so charming that ""Damned United"" is for me the best football movie, even before Hooligans (where in my opinion the focus is very little on football), Football Factor and The Miracle of Bern."
positive;"Handcrafted is to ""The Empire closes back"" anyway nothing to expose."
negative;Superman clearly shows that the comic films become much too much over the top.
positive;"First of all it seems as if it would finally go uphill again ""until the couple of a night begins to see things that are as incredible as wonderful and above all give Jessie new strength against every reason."
positive;For me, this film is an outstandingly successful action spectacle, which you could only rarely see again since the release of the movie in 1993.
positive;I have rarely experienced so much fun, excitement and action in the cinema.
positive;The only flaws I noticed here in the somewhat faster movements, but sponge over.
negative;And yet his â€œOriginâ€TM is another one, from which are the three â€œTanz der Teufelâ€TM films â€œ the man has total horror roots.
positive;That's what the movie does - but only in the first few minutes.
negative;Unfortunately, however, I expected in the ca.
positive;For me he will always be cult
positive;I can breathe a little bit: after this movie year some Sequels are quite fit in the future TOm Cruise's fifth use can quite let us see, although not error-free: the film is overall solid, with its running time however clearly too long.
positive;Something's wrong!
positive;The game of mimics and gestures is multifaceted and Caine proves that he can claim almost any role for himself.
negative;"In short, to call a dancing, ""freak"" Spiderman with a new hairstyle, who does not even scare at intrusive-penetrant photographers sometimes even an expression afterwards."
negative;As a fan of the Saw series you can look at the film, even if the film no longer reaches the parts 1 to 4.
positive;"I really should go out more often."""
positive;very good story and actor, if only every movie would be so super!
positive;Just perfect he plays the dirty and unmoral Bruce Robertson.
positive;With a lot of cinematic skill, successive (possible) reliefs and twists are brought into play, which all possible create the intended screen confusion.
negative;effrayanttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
positive;The film also clearly follows the guidelines of the series: if a gag is racist, sexist, immoral or bad, it is polished up and packed in, which is why the film contains a huge amount of incorrect jokes about which you can skim away â€ , or you watch the movie with a great deal of death and get no laugh or anything out of it (such as that Saddam Hussein is gay here and is lying in bed with the devil all the time).
negative;I was hoping for more.
positive;Much more funny and animating to memorize... I'm now ready to accept a traditional gesture of human gratitude...I'm not one of the Boovs, I'm part of it...
negative;- Bullshit.
positive;The film is not an absolute masterpiece, but one of the top films of this genre!
positive;on the basis of the always recurring slapstick inserts also for me much more recommended than e.g. finds nemo!
positive;The film is stylishly staged and above all cool.
negative;But he changed my mind about Guy Richie.
positive;Super fighting and racing scenes and a fantastic end!
negative;(Interesting also the discussion about the, according to the main actresses, during the shooting of the sex scenes terrible atmosphere, which Abdellatif Kechiche is supposed to have conjured up).
positive;If you just want to see a ball, you're wrong about the movie.
positive;Up under the chin armed you really push the thumbs, that he pulls the degenerate as the decadent purgels to the vertex.
positive;From me 10/10, it's not better!!
negative;This is horrifying - and so it is.
positive;It is simply great how the consequences of the political upheavals after the collapse of the Republic are intrigued and how the Empire has changed life in the far-off galaxy is shown to us.
positive;I noticed that here are some extremely negative reviews.
positive;Unfortunately to my criticisms: Somehow the basic tone of the story does not seem conclusive to me.
positive;In general, it was interesting to analyze some faces in the film.
positive;The remaining score is of course also excellent.
positive;When he finally ran, I grabbed my girlfriends and dragged them to the movies.
positive;A film that is supposed to be so refreshingly unconventional and colorful.
negative;Comedian boredom.
negative;Nevertheless, the film could score overall due to the tension and the naja relatively good actor.
positive;That's where the extraterrestrial power comes to your aid.
positive;This movie scared me all the way to the Mark.
positive;The character of Maz Kanata played by Motion Capture looks very computer-generated at the beginning, but if she is more visible in the picture, that doesn't matter so badly anymore, and Lupito Nyongo misses her 1000 year old character a lot of emotion, but I still don't find her 100 percent successful.
positive;Or better: WHO is good and who is evil.
positive;Barry's life is accompanied by classical music and it just fits every scene.
negative;Didn't know the book, only the nothing-saying trailer and still only saw a lukewarm movie with large (extensive) guns and exchangeable actors.
positive;But what the hell.
negative;[...] The bottom line is that the second part cannot reach the first water and does not receive any recommendation from me - especially not for the cinema.
positive;In short: I am absolutely thrilled and will certainly watch the film again.
positive;On which one is again discharged into a wondrous world.
negative;And the fact that at the end she shopped your guns did not make it any better.
positive;The acting performance of Daniel Brühl makes the young Niki Lauda really come to life again.
negative;Either I'm getting old or the Bond movies are getting flatter.
negative;Wouldn't there be the great landscape shots, the usual clear images of the camera of Wim Wenders, the usual perspectives and the many influences that can be had beyond the action, how to guess the small town life in these places or the architecture of the buildings - what would then remain?
positive;Happy End or Tears?
positive;"Also ""click"" has become a really good movie again, which will not detach any Sandler fan."
positive;But then The Conjuring came and the movie really blew me off.
positive;If you want to see something skurill funny, don't miss this movie.
negative;But the worst thought out is that it is so easy to steal someone's time when it has to be such a great technology.
positive;I'm also a fan of Takeshi Kaneshiro!
positive;In his Green Room not only the fear is barricaded, but also the relationships of the individual characters, who, although very superficially, get depth and do not function as mere battle objects.
positive;At first, the story is confusing, but soon the viewer can get a glimpse.
positive;And authentic is the film, which is connected with the main characters - as mentioned -, continues to take place over the several supporting characters and must last in the script.
positive;The movie just turned out to be great!
negative;Where's Burtonâ€TMs charm?
positive;Especially Thomas F. Wilson, who plays his Biff fir just as bad as lovable, is here the ideal cast of the Bad-Guys.
positive;After possible concentration difficulties, I was completely captured by this film in the full cinema in Vienna.
positive;The film made me very thoughtful and I took some information material.
negative;Vanellope who has continuous mistakes..
positive;"In the first two parts he also succeeded well to very well, ""An unexpected journey"" finally offered a successful start to the trilogy or in a great adventure and ""Smaugs Einöde"" thrilled then totally with incredible recordings that let you have the chinlade down even without a story."
positive;I just got out of the movie and have very fresh and emotional influences.
negative;The story is about a Piranha attack during a spring break at a lake.
positive;Greetings Laura
negative;This role would also have been able to take over Mike.
positive;Dumpbacking and image reader will probably not be able to do much with the film, but you can and shouldn't do it right to everyone.
positive;The Dark Knight is an ingenious Batman movie.
negative;Often the camera is so close to the people, but also a lot of scenery can be saved - which makes the actors the most important thing at the same time.
positive;I can still understand and accept that the rules of physics are being disregarded.
positive;No La La water...
negative;Very German, little loving implementation.
positive;This is one of these films where actually only one word is enough to evaluate it...SCHÃ–N!!
positive;Travers has an idea of her figure and she needs to learn to share it in an examination of her past.
negative;"A then rejected ""SchÃ1⁄4ler"" myself invented super-cracks has lost control over its destroyer robot."
negative;DiCaprio and colleagues really good.
positive;This autobiographical suede film about the life of Charles Bukowski is simply fantastic.
positive;Conclusion: A film that is not forgotten so quickly and should protect one awake.
positive;Also the sets, the equipment are very impressive and â€œ powerfulâ€œ.
positive;Conclusion: Fantastically staged, content interesting and especially for fans incredibly entertaining new entry into the alien universe!
positive;They simply have in Italy the New York of the 19th century.
positive;"Hilary Swank is born for these martial characters (""One Million Dollar Baby"") and Rockwell proves that he can also deviate from the evil and take over the sentimental role."
positive;Ozone tells us far from porno-voyeurism about the self-search of a young woman, represents her experiences with prostitution, understandably as exaggerated harmonious, but is mainly interested in the emotional developments in his main character, which is magnificently portrayed by Marine Vacth.
positive;:) http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/171198.html 4 Emmet is a construction worker in a very similar city where he buys overpriced coffee from chains every morning, music hears that is popular and builds what he told him one day he finds a stone, which makes him a favourite.
negative;There would be the trio consisting of Lou (Luis Guzman), Arnie (John C. Reilly) and Chuck (John Turturro).
positive;Ibrahim Celikkol, the ultimate romantic hero of Turkish films, excels on a role with extreme emotions, without saying too much lines, just a performance using facial expressions, body language and mainly his eyes.
positive;It is probably even the best Wekr vvon Miyazaki so far.
positive;"Again here again all parts of the Alien Quadrology, well ""Alien"" is still unsurpassed by the Sequels nevertheless all parts somehow belong together"
positive;I can only recommend the movie.
positive;The story is very good and provides more than enough for discussion needs.
negative;Please forget what just happened and go to â€œThe Avengersâ€œ.
negative;To be completely honest, I always found Heath Ledger a little overrated - especially after his death.
positive;"At ""300"" Snyder never really told a story, since the fight scenes were that only good."
positive;WOOOWWW MFG Gassi
positive;8.
positive;Is that always right for everyone?
negative;Includes biting comments from the alcoholic.
positive;Then I clearly missed Kurt Wagner the Nightcrawler!!!!
negative;Matt plays a supporting role that seems even less important!
negative;Scrap!
positive;In this respect, this is once again one of the films that you can hardly make â€œ tastier â€œ but who likes movies of this kind certainly does nothing wrong.
negative;To laugh at me!
positive;As always, Andy Serkis is an important role in this, which he adds again neatly, to an already great performance and leads his character further into dark backgrounds, which you can already look at him.
positive;As a spectator, you're almost tempted to clap when Depp alias Sweeny finally gets Alan Rickman under his blades.
positive;Great!
positive;"DiCaprio shows here once again that he belongs to the most changeable and best of his guild, but the Oscar is not necessarily necessary here (although for many other of his roles).Until last he leaves the audience over the true intentions for his life story in the dark and enthuses rather his old Flame Daisy, which is played somewhat childishly naive but with a lot of charm by Carey Mulligan (""Wall Street 2"")."
positive;In the middle it has so some heavier and gets boring but the ingenious and completely surprising end, makes it loosely away again.
negative;Gilmore Girl...RORY A film that is exciting at the beginning and loses more and more value at the end......
negative;don't put too much expectations in the movie.
negative;He's already exciting and moving.
positive;7, 21).'
positive;I found the movie, like some of my previous speakers, just great.
positive;The gags are just great.
positive;Let's make a story short because of predictability and clichés, otherwise a great, entertaining, emotional movie with great actors and a bombastic soundtrack.
negative;That was probably much too busy with that the film reached the great optics.
negative;Upright men!
positive;Despite the length of the film, it is not a second boring or cheesy.
positive;- Excellently implemented.
positive;"many films are ""surrectable"", the grudge it wasn't for me."
positive;Grand finale.
positive;The man only wants to know if the operation was successful and surrenders to his fate.
positive;He may be sympathetic, but in some places he is not characterized enough.
positive;Truly outstanding performances carry the construct over the full length and the great part morally at least questionable acts get precisely thereby a often painful and melancholic understanding, as it can hardly transport a second film with similar themes.
positive;I gave the movie 4 stars, because this nevertheless moved a little into the lengths..but in the big and the whole we often laughed tränen..and the conclusion is also such a brilliant!!
positive;But it's not a problem.
negative;"Despite years of presentation of the topic ""Tom Cruise als Stauffenberg"" in the media, despite the view of the well-known actor with well-known eye flap in well-known SS-Uniform, despite the title change, which makes it clear again that this is not a Wagner-filming, despite all these clear hints, which should also tell the last idiot about what a plot it is here, the German distributor meant to add still the brusque-nächtern subtitle ""Das Stauffenberg Attentat""."
positive;Acting, both Grace Kelly and Carry Grant can fully convince.
negative;Under these circumstances, I find these explicit concentration camp scenes simply inappropriate and disturbing.
positive;The way he dumps a killer and his car here is absolutely unscrupulous.
negative;Were Enslin given drugs?
negative;This list of inconsistencies could be continued, but it is only one thing to mention, which would very much encourage the inclined book reader.
positive;No, that was not a comic film that is realistic and profound.
positive;Two people, who could not be more different, meet each other and become friends.
positive;Look at the movie.. it's worth it =)
negative;I can't.
positive;It is also impressive that one actually feels put into the spaceship - more than with all Star Trek films, in which the viewer feels more like an outside observer.
positive;Five minutes have the that time, which can be sheufiert by the 'driver' in security.
positive;The real highlight of the film are the songs and the attention to detail.
positive;I wonder again and again how some try to analyze comedies on logic solvers and draughts.
positive;"Fosses Cast has fully understood the concept of ""Cabaret"", and shines without exception with quite wanted overacting, only in order to approach in the next moment also the quieter passages with the nötigen SensibilitÃ¤t."
positive;At no point in the film you have the impression that this is only possible in Hollywood films.
positive;Beautiful retro and exciting.
positive;I'm totally excited
positive;In addition to Jake Gylenhaal, there are two other names, which have been especially preoccupied by their acting performance – Mary MacDonnell (as Darko's mother) and Beth Grant (as a somewhat crazy teacher).
positive;In the end, the audience even applauded what I really haven't experienced many times.
positive;"[...] Just to hit the timpani quite loudly at this beautiful place: THIRST â€"" BLUTDURST is perhaps the most unknown super horror film of the late seventies."
positive;Sure, the IMDb Forum called massively for this change of power.
negative;The woman is a joke.
positive;Because this movie is just so full of action.
positive;Part of the series and if the development continues, then it can rise to one of the best Marvel films at all.
negative;For me, Silver Linnings remains Cooper's only landmark.
positive;I haven't seen a movie in a long time, in which the violence came so brutally over me.
positive;Not because the scene was bad, but because it wasn't perfect.
positive;The soundtrack, which was composed here by Michael Giacchino and whose theme was taken over by John Williams, is fantastic.
positive;Never look back when you leave a place where you want to return!
positive;Great soundtrack, the characters are absolutely understandable - if you don't see yourself in them, they will definitely remind you of someone you know!
positive;The joke is, you hear him talking all the time, but you only get to see him three times.
positive;If the film is criticized as violence-glorifying with reference to the aesthetic battles and the weapons-distributing Santa Claus, this is quite acceptable.
positive;What he does in his spare time is put there.
positive;What's fair?
positive;In detail, however, certain differences are to be discovered, which make the overall picture a little easier.
positive;I have now thought for a long time how I can explain a part of the story after all these explanations and statements without much anticipation so I put a few small glances here at the end of the article so everyone who has come to the taste and has managed to read it here in the first place to decide whether he still wants to read something of the story or not.
negative;Really great effects.
positive;But then you barely notice it, you're tied up and you can't look away.
positive;It's already stone-old, but certainly one of the best science fiction parodys of all time (and a film on which Bully's dreamship Surprise has been more than clearly oriented!).
positive;It is always exciting and gives hardly any breather.
positive;Hats off.
positive;Especially when Neeson collaborates with director Jaume Collet-Sera, which was already more than satisfactory with â€œUnknown Identityâ€œ and the plane crash â€œNon-Stopâ€ .
positive;I know what you think, what a pale comment.
positive;"""Jack Reacher"" director McQuarrie prays this mantra skillfully, stylistically savvy and even better than in ""Ghost Protocol"" (despite that very strong) with a clearer, more linear storyline."
negative;That everything has to play within a week, I consider the strongest and most inconvenient mistake.
positive;(Attention Spoiler: Tatum and Stu.
positive;Yeah.
positive;They have also immediately concluded with Anna when she wakes up in the layoff.
positive;The film is sensational, one of my all-time favorites.
positive;How many hundred people have stopped and filmed from the nearest vicinity???
positive;There's no pathos, there's no hero to win.
negative;I just missed too much of the movie.
positive;Second part, same director, and same duel at the same time at the cinema ticket offices.
positive;When brought here to the picture area, is truly a masterpiece.
positive;The combination between Western and Sci fi is simply awesome.
negative;Unfortunately, once again my skepticism was confirmed.
positive;And yes, it's tough, either the good dying in the movie or the bosses, that's certainly quite martial, but if you know the comics, you know for sure that the 1 to 1 is from the template, so listen up with the prologues against Rodriguez.
negative;The figures themselves remain pale and stand in contrast to the rather picturesque landscape.
positive;The criticism is apt.
positive;And in the end, it's one of those movies where you're gonna sit down at the credits.
positive;Entertaining, interesting and above all inspiring dialogues.
negative;2.
positive;Best movie of the year.
positive;I find the film idea and the entire implementation good, just as naturally the actors, - absolutely recommended!
positive;The implementation of facial expressions and gestures in monkeys is sensational.
positive;The blatant b/w version is impressed by the concentrated drama, in which space is available for a love story that is, if only initially, felt, which fails the performance in the film, as well as for the symbolism of the pigeons, which runs through the whole film.
negative;The constant lurking threat, the constant uncertainty, when, against whom and last but not least as the predator would strike, all that gave the first part stimulus and suspense comes to the successor completely absent[...]A few plus points earns itself â€žPredator 2â€œ in the end only by the use of Alan Silvestri's memorable score and by the fact that his title character still lives from the fascination of her brilliant design[...] ----------------------------------------------------------------- complete review see: http://christiansfoyer.wordpress.com/2010/06/24/classic-predator-2/
positive;Of people who initially do not notice how their life goes down, however, and probably not too late, wake up and take their life back into their own hands.
negative;In this respect, the film underscores my worst fears and amuses me equally: Jimmy Blue Ochsenknecht seems to see himself as an incrediblely cool sow and yet is only a cheap poser who hits himself in the pan.
positive;She suffers from pixellitis and is mocked as a misprogramming and is only allowed to follow the races in her game from her unfinished bonus game (the Colaberg).
positive;"Slumdog Millionairer is not one of these movies where you say: ""He was really entertaining"", or this is not enough to do justice to these cinematic treats."
positive;Partially, it's normal.
negative;Still, I kind of liked him, and I don't know exactly why.
negative;Conclusion: The first 100 minutes would save us Michael Bay.
positive;To give the movie in spite of smaller Schwächen under 7 is a little piggy :).
negative;So it wasn't my case.
positive;Why are the sharks in the open water rocket-fast and in the corridors always so fast that the fleeing victims just get away so quickly?
positive;Man should really spare pacifists to go to the cinema and also have to write a review.
positive;The film is incredibly intense and really very exciting.
positive;In the process, the two become friends with an old couple and share evenings together, until Rosemary suddenly becomes obnoxious after a mousse au chocolat and dreams that she is raped by the devil.
negative;You just never know what the movie wants to tell you.
positive;This is borne by a great cast led by the outstanding young actor Lewis MacDougall.
negative;The ambience is of course top, also the scene designers have done a great job.
positive;In the foreground now is not heroin, but what happened in the twenty years with our aged characters and that was not only highly interesting, but also really well worked out.
positive;But it doesn't go as hard as it was then, the video clip Optics falls off, but nevertheless I found it nice to see the old things freshly prepared again, especially since the film in the end once again wonderfully leads in front of your eyes where you were given all the clues that you then lost.
positive;Guys, guys, I always have to be with my head when I read some reviews here, ignorant and partly ridiculous comments.
positive;"Gibbs) and Mackenzie Crook (Ragetti) and, by the way, the creamhouses Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp *melt* ;) I have to say that I did not make too big hopes for myself when the 2."
negative;Apparently you have to steer the present-day audience with more visually visible things, annoyed indeed if you rarely see the aliens -.- f.) This boss who mimt the Bösen (Traeger) seems somehow to abuse the army completely for his purposes.
positive;Look, I absolute horror fan!
negative;But it is not yet completely overtaken.
positive;the highlight of this year...
negative;The representation of the actors is very convincing and Hanna alias Paula has actually sacrificed her wonderful hair for this project.
positive;Such system criticism is so rare from Hollywood that a second look is worth it, even if you can't do anything with the technically perfect, but idiosyncratic style.
positive;The movie's scary all the time.
negative;So not a bad movie, but also nothing special and after the great first part just distasteing!
positive;At first you experience impressively the very dreary and felt sad life of the Wall-EÂ ́s.
negative;Why didn't Affleck do any documentation about it?
positive;This is an art piece for itself and also means that you can see the films several times.
positive;In addition, you are rewarded by fresh, intelligent ideas and great pictures.
positive;See for sure!!
positive;Those who liked the kids should definitely stay seated after the end...!
positive;But in large measure a round film with excitement.
positive;It all starts on a beautiful summer afternoon.
positive;"Something I also liked about ""Contact"" was the lightness of the film, which makes it very pleasant and beautiful and yet not superficial and uninteresting."
positive;Computer effects and digital tricks didn't exist at the time.
positive;It is released from 6 and the children will suffer under the film and its sub-themes.
positive;The record on 3D is also a plus.
positive;Achberger Verlag -in Achberg am Bodensee- has printed several publications on the topic.
positive;I only saw the movie for the fourth time the other day and still find it totally exciting.
negative;You guys look familiar?
positive;No film for my ma'!
negative;I promised myself a lot more!
negative;I was and am more than disappointed by Terminator 3 Rebellion of the machines, as long as I waited for that finally another part after the grandiose and for me personally best action film of the world Terminator 2 day of the billing of the next part comes out, and then something like that.
negative;Eminem almost always has the same cool facial expression in the whole movie, whether he has a doctor.
negative;When the big names of Hollywood meet to shoot a movie together, it often turns out that it's too bad.
positive;"I stumbled rather randomly over the trailer to ""Ip Man"" and was immediately impressed."
positive;If there were the possibility to give a film three times ten points here, I would do it.
positive;"In ""The Dark Knight"" this concept is already made available to the viewer as a ""light"" version, without understanding the viewer with too much negative occupation of the hero."
positive;The end I find not so good, had found for josh another person chosen but many not so great that one has noticed in the cinema
positive;Excellent story, actor and production.
negative;"The only thing that can be slight evidence for the bodies, are to be heard with a few parts of words - ""Feiertag"", ..."
positive;Greetings to you
positive;"But ""I-just incorrigible"" taught me a better one."
positive;That's the story.
positive;the story may not be the most complex, but the film still offers me what I was hoping for from him.
negative;She is not able to watch TV or talk to lisbeth, let alone ask her about her living environment, but she is visited from time to time by lisbeth and dies before explaining the case!
negative;There he worked on his most important work â€žCanto Generalâ€œ.
positive;"Since some reviewers speak/write of supposed historical mistakes, here's a little info: Joe Wright published the story ""Pride and Prejudice"" from the beginning of the 19th century into the last years of the 18th century."
positive;The pure joy of staging, with which Woody Allen combines psychology satire, romance and farce, makes the film worth seeing.
positive;I find it reflects especially well the conflict between faith and science with the conclusion that both are not absolute and both belong to the human being.
negative;Sure, JÃ1⁄4rgen Vogel plays superbly routinely and also the one or other young actor understands to inspire.
positive;"Now I have finally seen ""absent"" and I am deeply impressed."
negative;"In direct comparison with ""Gattaca"" you can unfortunately ""In Time"" only reveal."
negative;Anyone who gets too close to the girl is led by suggestion to believe in the great fear that he puts into himself and also to die, although this act never happens and only takes place in the victim's head.
positive;Otherwise, filmmakers and viewers remained de facto outside, strictly speaking, without being involved, without function – not even the subjective perspective would be really preserved.
positive;"Homosexuality does not occur in this world, for example; the figure of the Colette is actually the classic lesbian for me: as the only woman in a male world, leads home after the end of work in skin-tight leatherkostüm on her motorcycle, ect."
positive;Of course you have many classic scenes, such as silence and then loud, shrill tones, but the jumpscares really keep themselves in limits.
negative;Unfortunately you have seen the best ones here again in the trailer.
negative;Please write a review with at least 100 characters.
positive;"And ""Mulholland Drive"" has more than enough of that."
negative;The lack of quality of the film would be half as bad if it would not present itself as a high-gloss thriller with nostalgic charm.
negative;"So I for my part was very disappointed by the second part ""The Saints of Death""."
positive;Actually, it's a miracle that a movie like Moon could still be created these days.
negative;One does not recognize a tension arc or at all a clear line.
positive;The action is fetzig and can also impress in today's time.
positive;Unkempt, with seven-day beard and stinking of alcohol, he also tries to keep the connection to the ex-wife and the son together somehow and more bad than right.
positive;The best thing about the movie, however, are the incalculable Cameos.
positive;An intelligent story about a boy who can see dead people, and then to a child psychologist who is very well occupied with Bruce Willis.
negative;Nevertheless, I was betrayed by Antoine Fuquas (Training Day, King Arthur) of pathos-induced war drama.
negative;There also a look over doesn't help anymore.
positive;With its phenomenal cast and a story that goes for almost three hours, Heat promises an outstanding film.
positive;The story is absolutely predictable, but worth seeing.
positive;"just by its quiet and inconspicuous approach ""nader and simin"" is so powerful and suggestive, so much that it does not even appear so directly to you while looking."
positive;Conclusion: Tom Cruise of a few action films I like.
positive;With wit and speed, the counterpole is built up: Clare Danes at the beginning Garderobiere plays against it and becomes his competitor.
positive;The last time a movie almost never hurt me was with Lord of the Rings-the Persecuted!
positive;The bosses are bugs!
positive;Mel Gibson is still insanely controversial today, after so do an outsider that he has made and you don't have to do this right.
negative;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
positive;In the end, many questions remain open and the film definitely makes you want more.
negative;Too bad.
negative;Only the story is so talked about the hot porridge and in the mixer, that in the end you don't even follow.
positive;â€œMan of Steelâ€œ?
negative;"That's why I wanted to see the second one, but somehow the ""witnesses"" seem so forced and real laughs aren't really there either!"
positive;The man shows an absolute one-man show in this movie.
positive;Bad is, on the MI - parts, that it always gives a new part only after 4-5 years.
negative;"I went into this movie without great expectations; I was just thrilled by its theme: Someone is born old and is getting younger over time."
positive;And actually, David Lynch is one of the directors of my trust.
negative;Thus a offset piece was created, in which with every scene change also a felt new backround is illuminated.
positive;Conclusion: Convincing well-being comedy with magnificent performer performances and a perfect equipment.
positive;It's just a problem between feeling, mind and reality.
positive;Just look at him!!
positive;Probably the most sophisticated and realistic action film ever made.
positive;Taken - short, precise and meaningful.
positive;Story is typical, IMO.
positive;So the Roy Bland played by Ciaran Hinds is unfortunately quite overreacting.
positive;No, a princess wasn't Tonya Harding.
negative;Those who have read the book know that, first, Percy does not get a shield from Luke, but only the shoes of Hermes, which he gives to Grover, because Percy doesn't manage to steer the things, second, Percy gets this princely flash of Ares, with which he later delivers a showdown that is really important for the book's further action.
positive;), High Tension or Eden Lake impressively proved how exciting such films can be.
positive;It was foreseeable that a second part of this series would not be waiting for long.
positive;Very great plot and exciting cinema experience guaranteed.
positive;I'm glad you're here.
negative;A through and through oversized film.
negative;Stallone brings you role well over but the father-son conflict comes somehow too plump and the figure of the Rocky opponent (name already forgotten ) comes from my point of view far too short in the whole movie.
positive;For example, it is necessary to keep in mind during the film how nice it is to have someone who just listens to one, to whom we can put out our heart, as the yakuza does at the beginning and to know that the other listens.
positive;The film is a true pearl far away from the mainstream and counts for me among the ten best films in film history.
negative;But what Kapur (or the screenwriter) wanted, he probably did not know himself.
positive;We once have Kirstin Wiig, whom I find really likeable as one of the few actresses and who also has something acting on the box.
positive;His music is consistently tailored to the respective scene and not intended to be nudged on CD in hindsight.
positive;The â€žI Am Legendâ€TM with many as blockbuster failed me personally no wonder.
positive;Lengths are the result of this unbalanced staging - it can not always go uphill.
positive;The intensity of this film, which appreciates the advantages of screen production, is difficult to beat live on the stage and at the same time a fascinating representation for the spectrum of staging and acting art.
negative;Here the action is not well dosed, but at some point omnipresent, whereby the work of any verve is lost.
negative;All in all not recommended.
positive;"Then the shot Cruise wakes up like from a dream and now stands there his old friend takes off his ""alleged"" girlfriend suddenly a mask and under it comes the face of a bodyguard Hoffmans to the appearance (what is that?)"
positive;"And there, the two sisters interrupt their dialogue and ask the question: ""Do you want to come too?"""
positive;The little Payton is portrayed by Madison Pettis super-süß and The Rock shows up as a father who learns that there are more important things in life than fame and money, from a very different, in my opinion, extreme side.
positive;The film is certainly not a mainstream, it is a grotesque, a niche film.
negative;which however does not approach the original, especially because the characters act much more unsupervised, which makes them less credible.
positive;Super movie and top cast!
negative;It was supposed to be a spy thriller, wasn't it?
positive;It is deliberately so chosen.
negative;Pirates of the Caribbean is great!
positive;Just to laugh broken.
negative;The only positive thing about the movie are the strong fight scenes, otherwise I found it only lengthy and boring.
positive;The story is not completely new but reinterpreted, the landscapes and the Navi with their language and culture are incomparable, the implementation with the at this time new 3D technology is stunning and the most amazing for me is the background statement, which every person should take to heart especially in the present situation of world politics.
positive;"Wild Child is a really good, entertaining movie for young people, and people who keep the ""child"" alive in themselves."
positive;If only the blood or only the eyes have colors one feels as a fan immediately at home again and later when one hears the epic soundtrack, the city wakes up to life again.
negative;He's an inconceivable mob that fails because of the tiniest inconsistencies in his life.
positive;He knocked me out.
negative;But please don't do that.
positive;But let's face it, that's part of it.
positive;Sandra Bullock plays her role very credible.
positive;Found Bane's voice in the beginning also a bit exaggerated, but noticed with the OV that you are almost identical.
negative;I don't know what I'd rather be.
positive;To the 8 he creates it however by addressed sticks.
positive;Wonderful color choice!
positive;For a great movie evening so only highly recommended!
positive;I would still be very pleased to be able to watch this movie a second time on DVD.
positive;The actioner of Justin Lin seamlessly taps into the first part of the row and leaves part 2 and the distasteing 3.
positive;Imaginative and psychologically brutal, he criticizes the reduction of the woman to an object.
positive;Less backgrounds are delivered here.
negative;MFG Sunny17
negative;The actors were good and also the trick technique was right.
negative;The pubic hairs will fall out of everyone else's eyes.
positive;Anakin's inner tornness and his constant fear of loss, along with the chancellor's intrigue and the Jedi's lack of trust make him the ball of his feelings.
positive;But then at the end Christopher Walken's character comes up with an idea of how the script could go out.
positive;And Kostya can sing so well...
positive;The film goes with me only very close to the highest rating.
positive;The action is great staged and the story has a pleasant pace.
positive;Rarely can you watch a movie so often and still laugh about all the jokes.
positive;==References==
negative;"""Peter Pan"" wants to be PlÃ¤doyer to the carefreeness of being a child and to confront the seriousness of growing up - including social conventions - but is aimed at a very young clientele."
positive;The had mMn fit much better to the rest of the film.
positive;Add an extremely cool Jamie Foxx, lots of humor and a clenched load of action.
positive;One of the most beautiful stories ever brought to the film screen.
positive;So respect to the screenwriters and PJ.
negative;Theatre pieces already function as books only conditionally - so that they unfold their effect, they must be staged, possibly also reinterpreted.
positive;So I didn't think the movie was bad, he wasn't so punctual but entertaining.
negative;"1"" as masterpieces, otherwise his films usually get on my ass (Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown excluded)."
positive;It is quite unlikely that Forman's intention was to make a biography.
positive;WHY have you all been here?
positive;One could say that I live in paradise, in absolute purity - but to be only pure can hardly really agree with me.
positive;This is due, among other things, to the beautiful quiet recordings and the very good soundtrack, which runs through the whole film and is always used exactly right.
negative;Set is a bit low budget (Rumänien halt), but not quite as bad as the whole C movie action movies a la Steven Seagal.
positive;With the end of his commitment to Derby County and the end of his friendship with Peter Taylor, Brian Clough's time begins at Leeds United and thus his demise.
positive;With â€œDestinationâ€œ director Neil Burger (â€œWithout Limitâ€œ) creates a cinematic masterpiece that immediately lets you immerse yourself in this dystopian world.
positive;I love this movie, one of my favorite movies, if not THE favorite one!
positive;Michale Bay has his line and he has consistently increased it.
negative;punch drunk love is not exactly a movie of my variant.
negative;But--Push cake.
positive;Thanks for reading your Alexander von Eich
positive;With Will Smith as Deadshot I had my concerns but I was surprised, better one would not have been able to represent it.
positive;Conclusion: Hard action, short action without time to breathe â€ , a film that is simply short and good!
negative;The score is a matter of taste, my thing is not.
positive;Anyway, there should be more, such great, entertaining, intelligent blockbuster in the next years: Always come with it!
negative;A really good actress can hide the fact that the earth is round, because Galileo decided that in the past and not because God created it like that.
positive;the bull is the best!!
positive;Simple class: Dolph Lundgren :-)
positive;"Whether it is a ""male"" or ""violence fantasy"", just a child's dream in the Wahnwitz Palahniuks or the film is a happy coincidence from a talented director and an author beating on the same wave lengths - the deepest statements of the film remain undisputed in the composition, logic or violence alike: main thing want!"
positive;Of course I don't like the cgi effects at all but this film proves that it's also credible.
negative;"""Hexe Lilli: The journey Mandolan"" belongs to the former, but fails in almost all areas."
positive;"Cameron's ""Aliens"" is the best sequence in film history with ""Terminator 2"" and ""the empire strikes back""."
positive;Definitely earned the Oscar.
positive;Very inspiring and realistic close !
positive;In my opinion, no wheel was reinvented here but due to the excellent design no cent is invested too much for the card!
positive;Also the older versions of the two movie sisters, played by Crystal Reed and Anastasia Phillips, I found great, whereby especially Phillips also leads to maximum performances.
negative;The half of the film also plays in the war.
positive;A decision that contributes positively to the atmosphere of the film.
positive;Violence, thirst, icy colds, hunger.
positive;I can only look at it.
positive;The figure of the ophthalmologist and the young nobleman are therefore relatively identical in their personal history!
positive;The 20-year-old Scarlett Johansson (Lost In Translation, The Girl with the Pearl Earring) also does not make any mistakes and plays her role constantly well.
positive;Interestingly, that one has tracked this party after all the years.
positive;This is one of the nicest movies I've seen.
positive;It runs without a kind of dialogue, monologue or conversation.
positive;Ever since I first saw the film, every time I see it, I've got corn skin and a broad, psychychotic grin on my face.
positive;It's a great movie.
positive;With an oscar-würdigen KostÃ1⁄4mdesign and massive scene pictures trumps up â€žLichtâ€œ.
positive;Grandma I liberal this movie, which was and is just awesome!!!
negative;the film is as slow and eventless as the life of the adolescent that it portrays - interrupted by endlessly unpleasant violence of the script.
positive;Actually, the action is limited to destruction, destruction and... destruction.
positive;The film or book proves the opposite.
positive;"So I can only highly recommend ;) Love Grüße clemY"
positive;I think it's the first comedy Lynch made.
positive;Director and screenwriter Joss Whedon was an almost inhumane body to inspire millions of fans as well as critics at the same time.
positive;Original comedy with top actors, which however loses some drive in the course.
negative;Jack Black will almost forget after the movie.
negative;I don't want to draw any comparison to the book (which, by the way, I didn't like too much either), as the film stands alone for itself.
positive;This makes her president Snow (genial Donald Sutherland) very clear right at the beginning, she must continue to play the love for Peeta ( Josh Hutscherson).
positive;Mega good movie.
positive;Above all, we are a clique (all ca.
positive;I notice this myself, as I spend most of my time in wien and get to know myself from the supermarket.
positive;I just have to watch this movie at least every year, because it's so awesome.
positive;Spitted with beautiful performances by Julianne Moore and Danza (who is really great as Jon's father) the film convinces as a small but fine comedy with satirical aspects.
positive;Great story and great actors!
negative;He plays that really credible :-).
negative;"The senators are also named in this way; Senator Gaius also remains without surnames and thus a meaningless figure, as is Falco; on the other hand Senator Gracchus has only one surname, but no first name."
positive;But exactly on this scheme I have personally seen myself for a long time.
positive;"Conclusion: Even with the x-th time I still like ""Shining""."
positive;A very sad, but also extremely recommended film for the fall.
positive;I was in the sneak and I looked at him with four women and a man.
positive;"Carie Ann Moss as ""Trinity"", and always very faithful to their occupation members!"
negative;So if you know the original, you can't really do anything with this, if you first see it, you will find â€TMs nice â€TM but at no time unusual.
positive;Nevertheless, Episode III is a really successful movie.
negative;Part present ...
negative;The idea that I had through the book and the cartoon series from the 80s of the world of Alice was not transported in Tim Burton's film any closer.
negative;Is she afraid the audience wouldn't want to see her in other roles anymore?
positive;The old couple are the messengers from the afterlife who bring the new roles into their film (e.g. Betty) and bring them back again (they urge Betty to kill herself after the murder of Rita).
positive;Family and friends are important!
positive;And in between?
positive;Also great actors and nice pictures.
positive;There are in fact a few unusually bloody places, but I don't think that the life purpose would be, that speaks IMHO only for the consequence of the staging.
positive;In addition to really excellent driving scenes and a great camera work, of course Hemsworth and Brühl impress in their roles.
positive;How she flirts in discos and the alcohol to get rid of her grief.
positive;Absolutely recommended!
positive;But that's all he's told.
positive;It's exciting and not as unrealistic as the original...
negative;"In order to be honest, I don't understand why the hell this grumpy movie got a number of 7/10 points on FILMSTARTS.De, or say it like this: I would have understood it if movies like ""Dance Flick"" or ""Little Man"" had the same number of points, although in defense of the other movie you have to say: that they didn't try besides all the nievolose nonsense still great to swing the tolerance club around topics like: family values or friendship."
positive;Also the technique seemed quite ground-breaking, since one had e.g. no 3D hologram computer, as in meanwhile practically every sci-fi film and if we already talk about computers, I must of course praise the effects of the film, because what you get here is photorealistic!
positive;However, the film also has smaller weaknesses, which is why one should not condemn all critics of that time.
negative;The movie has an open end but just a bad one and I was totally disappointed.
positive;:-*
positive;I've had a good time.
positive;But Izzy has found her own way to deal with dying.
positive;A story of two young men who explore their continent, so alien to them themselves, and thereby perceive more and more what injustices reign in it.
negative;The question that asks itself for me now: Is a fourth part at all still meaningful?
positive;Boom, I watched the movie completely.
positive;And in addition, Disney manages to create a new character on Lightning's side, which has both wit and depth and creates real feelings.
positive;Apart from these two points, The Comeback is a really great movie, extremely rousing and very entertaining despite the length of over 2 hours.
negative;the next story with the haselnut and the small oak horn find everything super funny, but unfortunately I don't!
positive;However, I felt the last attitude of the film before the credits as completely inappropriate and inappropriate for the entire scenery of the film.
positive;How can you talk about story in an action fantasy and video game movie?
negative;The second part of the film, which depicts the fighting, is just like the introduction far too long and unobtrusive and also here it is teeming with repetitions.
positive;If the Asian invasions were perhaps minimally less, it would certainly have given 4.5 stars.
positive;Just like Winslet.
negative;The film is not a masterpiece, but in large part.
positive;Femme Fatale is an unusual thriller in which the focus on feeling a story (instead of analyzing a story) and the director's admiration for the cinematic form work incredibly well.
positive;Masterpiece!
positive;It is well thought out, actionful and extremely exciting.
positive;So what makes Gladiator an absolute must?
negative;Jean Reno has worked in much better movies like *Leon* or *Ronin*.
positive;I particularly liked the purity of heart of all characters.
negative;But the confusion does not stop.
positive;I don't care what film critics and professionals say about this work.
positive;In addition, it must be noted that 3D is not necessary for this film.
negative;Johnny Depp tries to save what is to be saved, nevertheless the film remains far between the expectations back.
positive;==References==
negative;Nothing.
positive;Even if a few scenes are quite over the top and almost already splatter without much blood, the movie only makes a real laugh, even if I didn't like the senseless militant part, but otherwise the movie was top.
positive;The pictures shown in this film are of great intensity.
positive;"The horror lurks in the form of Elvis Presley's vocals, dream visions are ""Von Winde Verweht""."
negative;Whether it actually after this bad continuation a 3.
negative;The sloth Sid annoys, the savory tooth tiger and the mammoth are boring.
positive;The beginning was structural engineering, the hammer, albeit nonsensical, that's probably true.
positive;A fun, tailored to Allen and Johansson, in which especially Scarlett Johansson doesn't make a very good figure.
positive;Some people may consider the things from a different angle.
positive;I like this movie I can watch it again and again ^^ really recommend
negative;There's the problem.
positive;But it's a film for all who want to see an extraordinary story about life and love - picking up, sharing and deep-rooted.
positive;Solidly made food with which there is no boredom, whether now more brutal than other films (in relation to the comparison of the BBC with Sin City) is to be put aside, since something like this is always subjective to consider.
positive;An absolute must for every horror fan
positive;Perhaps even a artistic impression, since the film is strongly drawn in form and content by a suggestive and deep psychological imagery.
positive;Fascinating in all of this is also the camera work, which makes the film look as if it was filmed in a single, long take, as are stars like Naomi Watts, Edward Norton and Emma Stone in the supporting roles.
positive;In the beginning, it actually still looks as if we had one of the well-known comedy-tatorte from the pen of Der Schuh-des-Manitu co-author Murmel Clausen (Weimar) or Stromberg-Schöpfer Ralf Husmann (Dresden) in front of us.
positive;Anyone who can get involved in the scenario experiences it with full force and hardness and thus the film not only brilliantly, no, it inspires and stimulates to think.
negative;When you're really bored.
positive;As a fan of post-apocalyptic scenarios, I already watched the film Solarfighters enthusiastically.
negative;Basically, this film has high potential for a serious story: the main character is a policeman with private problems, his â€œSchÃ1⁄4tzlingâ€ in the film a criminal who became a miscarriage of justice and it is also about the whole deportation and refugee theme.
positive;The motto of the Olympic Games also takes J. J. Abrams to heart in the sequel to his hit â€žStar Trek â€œ The future has begunâ€œ.
positive;Another recommendation: Snatch (Ritchie's comparable good movie, with almost identical cast)
positive;Morgan Freeman(Edison),Josh Hartnett(Black Dahlia),Ben Kingsley(War inc.)
negative;Story, atmosphere, autism, etc. Hooligans is once again a cheap smack of an epic film, which is transferred to the usual scheme in the Hollywood film factory.
positive;It perfectly underscores the oppressive atmosphere that builds up in the film.
positive;I don't know any actor who has always made such professional films.
positive;The plot is straight but interesting, and the dialogues and characters are just fantastic!!
positive;Maybe also because some from time to time seems consciously overlaid by a few degrees.
positive;The camera is very high quality and adds great drama to the situation.
positive;One should enjoy these 105 minutes and afterwards think about this tragic story.
positive;Who knows Nolan knows how his films are structured.
negative;Possession is the desperate attempt to divide exorcism into new, fresh ideas.
positive;A masterpiece!
positive;I like the bizarre handwriting of Tim Burton anyway, but this movie is really great!
positive;In addition to the - excuse - affable Batmobil is explained by Batman's equipment almost nothing.
positive;I laughed a lot and found him really super funny!
negative;"A censored version (less murder & manslaughter, less noise) could easily be ""from 6J."""
positive;The spectator embarks on a journey through time into a world that seems credible and tangible despite or precisely because of the meaningful stylizations and the grandiose mixed tone effects.
positive;It is an emotional methapher against the hamster wheel in which we rotate daily and from which there seems to be no way out.
negative;In principle, there is little to report.
positive;The movie has everything you need from an entertaining action evening with friends in the cinema!
positive;This movie is so full of little laughs and with a giant laugh the end-haudrauf-scene that is just unspeakably funny...
positive;For me this worked and I didn't get bored.
positive;"It's not a ""movie trip,"" it's not a fantasy story."
negative;Even identical twins certainly have something different and are not just clones of each other!
positive;He is, so to speak, the driving force of the team, the good soul and morals in person.
positive;Keanu Reeves is also the ideal cast for John Wick.
negative;if it goes pure after action and in how far a film should entertain me, then I can only say that I was much better entertained as Furious 6.
positive;Let's let the little Störenfried Logan aside, then Sexy Beast is basically even a Song of Songs on true friendship, love and solidarity.
positive;"!,... you're standing there for 15 minutes just stupid, you don't have time to think about it...."" hä?!"
positive;"Unfortunately, the movie came out here only on video â€"" why actually??"
positive;Of course, it's all about Wall Street again.
positive;Well Edwards had seen the movie himself and said: good movie, but only 5% truth.
positive;Can I highly recommend!!
positive;Robert Porter was ultimately a vehicle for him after he saw no meaning in his life.
positive;Once again, a strong contribution from Asia, which unfortunately went down on the international (Western) market.
positive;A creepy good adaptation of the book.
positive;You therefore feel with every character and so get deeper and deeper into the movie soong, which so quickly does not let you go.
positive;Rather use the â€œEchensartigenâ€ , than the â€œSüße, fluffigeâ€ , but for the real version of the Raptor.
positive;The whole design of the film reflects the inner development in each sequence.
negative;Even average (5/10)
positive;I was counting on a blue teen movie but I would really do it!
positive;Who does NOT watch the movie in the cinema miss the best movie at all.
positive;At the beginning, the second part is still at home in the quiet waters.
positive;The tone is also phaenomenal good.
negative;We watched the movie with several friends (most of them Woody Allen fans), with everyone there were very long faces after the performance !
positive;Finally a football movie that does not (only) deal with football!
positive;You can't laugh anymore and that Rogen and Efron are so good at harmonizing!!!
negative;He lays down everything that does not please him at the present time.
positive;As far as the action, effect and also the 3D are concerned, everything is said...just phenomenal.
negative;Honestly, every ZDF report about the Royals has more style and class than the implementation of this work.
positive;The structure could not be better.
positive;"In order to come back to the change of tone towards the end: If it were not inside, it would have become even more predictable, what ""Don Jon"", at least for me, would have set rather lower evaluation capacity."
positive;From this intimate bond, in which one is always there for the other, results in a deep, if not similar friendship over time - for both seem to know that it cannot exist in the long term under these relations.
positive;Absolutely worth seeing drama!
positive;However, the final confrontation between Potter and Voldemort would have earned a little more drama.
positive;The plot of the film is very exciting and surprising in between by one-two unforeseen turns.
positive;with friendly greetings your ball-blitzmaus
positive;The wonderful thing about this film are not the acting achievements, nor the superior intellect of the film, it is much more the great ingenuity of the plot.
positive;They were completely unnerved and asked if I would like to have their old truck stop cassette from youth time :/.
positive;It occurred to me that in the 2 hours in the cinema I saw a documentary about India a gangster thriller and a love movie at the same time.
positive;And it succeeds completely, although this is perhaps because she has chosen a film in which she plays the central character, but still does not have to wear the film.
positive;Finally a movie without a typical Hollywood cram.
negative;The Emperor's new clothes.
negative;These are to the greatest part rather boring and without sense and mind.
negative;the movie was really not bad and had some good scenes, but unfortunately they were not always particularly funny and original.
positive;2012: the ex-driver, Jensen Ames, is pushed into shoes by the murder of his wife.
positive;Conclusion: One of the best entertainment films in recent years.
positive;No, you can't.
positive;As a spectator, we can morally evaluate and interpret the protagonists (superior).
negative;I would have imagined the movie differently.
positive;Something special beautiful.
positive;A movie that you absolutely need to watch with your wife - if she is romantic and likes to watch such movies.
positive;I have to say that before sunset really surprised me.
positive;There can be no winners...
negative;Technically, the film is fine, with some crazy parts, all of which have to do with the projections and the devil.
positive;She cost her custody for her daughter and her career.
positive;The focus on the long and well thought out dialogues may be somewhat irritating.
positive;Personally, I'm also a fan of Edward Norton.
positive;And even the humor was not too short - the whole cinema room was agreed.
positive;Can something else go wrong?
negative;As with most other characters in the rest also.
positive;The decisive laser sword fight between Obi Wan and the Darth Vader, which has already become by name, is the longest in the whole Star Wars history.
negative;Unfortunately, only a very distasteful cinema visit.
positive;Strong also, as in the end surviving words come to speak, among others Doss himself...
positive;"For example, in a scene about the first part of ""Gremlins"" is pulled here."
positive;That's exactly what he's acting at.
negative;Nominated for the Golden Globe as Best Comedy???
positive;"The beginning is a little lame; unconditional tension is also not really given."
positive;If you have understood the film and know the scientific theories that are underlying it, the film is really great and offers material for stimulating discussions.
positive;So go in.
positive;After the ingenious first part, I wouldn't have thought that a sequel could still surpass that, but Step up 2 the Streets has made it more than possible.
negative;I read in reports that in America many visitors had to leave the cinema early, because the film is too violent.
positive;dominate the underworld, their leaders are unscrupulous and the police are battling around with correspondingly extensive problems.
positive;"""Fucking Fish"" is a gentle teenage romance that feels through and through real thanks to the two great leading actors, completely free of exuberant kitsch or strange clichés."
positive;if you want to laugh the fiml is really perfect...no milestone but thanks to carey a laughgarant
positive;To this extent, no other film of any genre has done so yet.
positive;The physical force with which Crowe distributes his Bud White locks is in a stark, but excellent contrast of vulnerability driven out of the character.
negative;The comparison with Twillentht is quite misleading, because here the love story has a relatively small part and the attention here lies quite clearly on the imaginative world of the shadow-jäger.
positive;:-) Well, I just want to say that the movie is really stunning and I would like it to be for me from such movies (I mean the love in this movie and of course so beautiful men like Hauro :-)) Moreover, I personally found the movie better than Chihiro's journey to Zauberland because in this movie much too much was wept.
positive;Because even if some think the story for Plumb or once, I find it excellently implemented.
positive;The film brings it as close to you as a film can.
positive;From the food to the weapons and the capitol, everything is oscar-ready.
positive;Jamie Foxx plays convincingly, although his character has some clichés, so she is nevertheless realistic.
positive;The 13.09.2018 is already fixed in my cinema schedule!...lg nina
positive;But the next step...
positive;So, the film I liked very much about itself.Well you should already be rocky fan or at least have seen one of the parts to form a opinion.Silvester surprised me in this part with real acting can.The film rather quiet and atmospheric. waits at the end but with a really beautiful finale and pleasure skin guarantee.
positive;Short and scarce -> Genial story, perfect shy player performance by Will Smith, good fear scenes and very nice shock and feeling moments in the movie.
negative;The episodes are inconsistency, are somehow unmotionally borrowed from a button, which makes me realize no character traits.
positive;Conclusion: A must...
positive;This disease, which Gloria died of afterward, once again gives the whole a better tension.
positive;After almost 30 years, I still hope for the 2nd.
positive;Haven't seen such a horny thriller in a long time.
positive;"Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) and his company were not an abstrusely composed ""world destroyer"" antagonists, which I felt was very pleasant."
positive;Especially from the eagle's perspective, the feeling of Middle Earth can be transported uncannyly and an unprecedented perfection sets itself up, which is maintained throughout until the end.
negative;The star cast is only available on the paper - apart from Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman the other well-known faces have practically no relevance for the film - and draw the contrast to the Lord of the Rings trilogy in this regard all the less.
positive;Intelligent, deep-rooted, entertaining and surprising.
positive;Unfortunately the film has some lengths in the middle part, which clearly the ideas run out.
negative;There's an example.
positive;short and painless The film 2014!!!!!
positive;PS: Can only recommend the engl.
positive;So by my opinion, saw is the best movie ever!
positive;Mr.
positive;This movie is a masterpiece and not just for Western fans.
negative;Tom Cruise took on this stuff in the 1990s and brought the film Mission: Impossible, based on the series, to the cinemas in 1996.
positive;A well-made film with good effects and one of the best films in the X-Men universe!
positive;He has a very intrusive kind and one would like to quote his seats also gladly.
positive;We saw him several times and analyzed where there are hidden clues to the resolution in the film (and there are many!!!!).
positive;It will be the kath that came into the headlines some time ago because of child abuse etc.
positive;His life is a coma...
positive;Honestly: who believes to get all the actions of the book in a film visibly presented has in the end a film in front of him, which one can only call as a limited entertaining.
negative;The imagery is well done.
negative;But it's also not so important, it's all about stunts from moving scrap vehicles in the desert and explosions in the second cycle anyway.
negative;Sometimes just boring and many inconsistencies.
positive;I'm sure you're looking!
negative;Accordingly, the film is not in itself coherent, but rather bumps from scene to scene.
positive;Grandios!
positive;Especially the combination of Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton as the main player was just awesome.
positive;It is also good to read the book about the film before.
positive;You can laugh and cry just perfect.
positive;However, he rejects abortions.
positive;==References==
negative;Conclusion: Extremely twisted, almost mysterious stripe that you can or can't ravage - I didn't do it anyway!
negative;"So I can't start all too much with the movie except for the ""hold on and everything will be fine""."
positive;"The film is historically incorrect, if someone expects something like ""Operation WalkÃ1⁄4reâ , will be surprised."
positive;"He searches the whole country for his favorite food: ""Twinkies""."
positive;That's all you need to write.
positive;"Paul Greengrass also proves with this film that, according to movies like ""The Bourne Conspiracy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" he does not rely on his success and lay down on the lazy skin."
positive;"Who ""see the brothers ... and die?"""
positive;"He's like a mix of ""Frech Beast"" and ""Girls Club""."
positive;"Similar to ""21 Gramm"", the film is not chronologically told, which fits perfectly to the story."
positive;The coloration is pleasant and warm, as well as the synchronous speakers carefully selected.
negative;The actors have put themselves well into the roles and you could exactly feel what they felt.
positive;At the moment, a scary fear seized me - everything seemed so real!
positive;The strip shines with very many successful computer effects and plentiful battle animals, a mixture of oriental mysticism and wild chases.
positive;Ship.
positive;The dialogues here are magnificent.
positive;He is really TOP!!
positive;What makes the film much bigger, however, is the atmosphere, the optics and the general mood.
negative;A bridge with great similarity to a building from a well-known German anti-war film, in which the whole futility of such defense actions and the war is shown in general.
positive;Conclusion: In every respect stone-old, but in a very own way fascinating and still worth to be seen.
positive;Definitely nothing for popcornkino lovers.
negative;The protagonists' acting skills are there, but what does it mean if the story is shuffled together?
negative;Despite the last 30 highlight minutes, I can't recommend the much too long guessed movie to adult fans.
negative;Yes, it is.
negative;The end will not be revealed here, is clear ne!
positive;"""We all travel through time together."
negative;"Quite funny but not to laugh in the sense of ""HAHA"" but rather ""HMMM"" with a slight grin on the lips!"
positive;If you're a fan of the show, the movie won't be able to, but for happiness, tasters are different.
positive;The whole film therefore seemed very European, almost like a pleasant French dialogue film in the style of a late Woody Allen.
positive;Many children have partly run out of boredom and out of fear from the cinema.
positive;He allows the massacre.
positive;The Nice Guys is a comedy from 2016, which has a running length of 116 minutes.
positive;How can you destroy a film ending like that?
negative;The actors are all quite unknown and replaceable, yet they perform their roles without problems (which is not particularly difficult with the simplicity of their characters).
negative;But well, let's whistle at it: if you swallow the completely overlaid story you can win from this high-tech Potter variant a lot of fun, high speed and colorful, quivering special effects.
negative;But hey, it's finally a monster movie!
positive;This film, carried by a melancholy beautiful soundtrack, reveals the horror of war and a possibility, such as children, who cannot yet conceive of the world as a whole, can process this cognitively.
positive;I don't think so.
negative;All the mistakes and unfaithful scenes (the end is the improbable high point!)
positive;Although in the end it may be one or two characters too much, but they all form a really nice team together, so that doesn't get annoying and even if it might be a few characters too much, everyone gets a backstory and you understand each character, also because they are really interesting (in the horror genre a true rarity).
positive;Sean Penn plays only a supporting role in this movie as his brother, but fills it strongly as usual.
negative;And let's be honest, most people find the film so dolle because of the 4 or 5 ultra-brutal scenes that I didn't expect.
negative;Let's say the case is that a woman hit a man and stuck with him in the window instead of driving to the hospital in her garage is true but only that.
positive;The story was well thought out!
negative;They are back there again and would not have to come back at all.
positive;He has a dense atmosphere and is going through exciting.
positive;Clear 10 points, and I now also belong to Clint Eastwood Fanclub :D
positive;There is suspense and partly the action is also quite rapid.
positive;Then it's not the man who dies, it's the woman who dies.
positive;Looking at the film as an experimental film, it can in turn be seen as a kind of random product, which would mainly refer to its appeal from its avant-garde unconventionalities: referring to itself or even to itself, ''Gerry'' does not seem to be at all appropriate.
negative;On the contrary, I find such a story extremely bitter, especially when the boys help themselves with TV and video psalms and get along with it.
negative;Great pictures.
positive;In many scenes, the music of John Williams is a total indy-feeling.
positive;Personally, the wrongly condemned actor had to convince me of his talent already after â€žCosmopolisâ€ or â€žLost City of Zâ€ , but in GOOD TIME he delivers without question by far the best performance of his career and one of the best acting performances of the 2017 cinema year.
positive;Film of the extra class.
negative;In the home cinema it might still be possible to do it halfway.
positive;Best Marvel movie in my opinion.
positive;The people who don't want to get involved in a Disney fairy tale with princesses and a lot of singing are told that this movie is really outstanding in its genre.
positive;A modern classic and my absolute personal favourites.
positive;for half a minute, but as far as the infallibility and power of the shown is concerned, one of the best.
negative;....] There is a complete review to read on the FILMCHECKER blog.
positive;they speak of the able.
positive;I particularly liked that one got an insight into the private life of the GDR ́ler and into the professional life of the Stasiangögerigen.
negative;That's too bad.
positive;Music is awesome, camera guidance is sometimes spectacular.
negative;I refer here only to the pseudo-fine-minded admissions of those who derive the suspicion of masterpieces from the numerous existing levels of meaning.
positive;This is mainly because the director mixes the most diverse genre wildly.
positive;However, the filmic implementation for many film lovers is an impressive innovation.
positive;Those who criticize must undoubtedly be able to do better.
negative;Every time she appeared in front of the screen with her eternal smile, I can cut one in her.
positive;But he made the bill without the psychopath Don Logan (Ben Kingsley).
positive;Those who expect a slasher in the style of Scream are just as disappointed as fans of torture films ala Saw.
negative;That dwarfs are superior builders, likewise.
positive;I don't believe it.
positive;The tension curve is fantastic, the film never goes out of breath, which is due, among other things, to good turns.
negative;Not because Sarah Jeffrey and Matthew Espinosa are playing it so badly, but because the film is going in that direction.
positive;Quite the contrary: humor is not too short.
positive;Nevertheless, Lin makes it really crash here.
positive;However, the Regissur Sijie Dai would probably like to present the political problem in China as much as possible, then he would not have marketed the film as a film of homosexuality.
positive;An ups and downs of amazement including some well-scattered laughs.
positive;really belongs to my absolute favorite movies.
positive;But the great characters just make fun.
positive;from this film you can let yourself be carried along, although the action is a bit confusing and you could ask yourself from time to time who has killed and dubbed who aba that around it all just rhymes again.
positive;Very recommendable!!
positive;I saw it only because of the good reviews and was very surprised!
negative;A little tension when Waltz captured Craig.
positive;The fact that the film also works so well, he also owes to his actors.
positive;Surya denounces the supremacy of the men.
negative;Can only recommend it to a limited extent.
positive;A man who has taken away 7 lives by himself is now trying to settle his debt for himself.
positive;"Tommy Lee Jones, too, once again excelling, as he plays this ""old man"", who has it on the one hand absolutely ""on top"" (in contrast to his underexposed young professional colleague), but on the other hand he doesn't come along with the meanwhile common gait anymore."
positive;At the beginning of the film, in the opening scene, I fell in love with the film.
negative;All the mutes of the spectators will become over the pile and the large resolution turns out to be an unoriginal twist, which only fades because it is so strunty.
positive;I think the movie was great!
positive;"However, when this is betrayed, the resistance fighters seem to have the victory on their side, but Ophelia's situation becomes more and more threatening, since the fulfilment of their tasks in the parallel world is also associated with great dangers... ""Pans Labyrinth"" can be seen as a parable on fascistic systems, which is especially recognizable by the person of the captain, who not only has unmistakable parallels to a certain Amon GÃ¶th."
positive;I really liked the movie and my sister!
positive;This can still happen in retrospect.
positive;For friends of demanding cinema highly recommended!
negative;After all, Rob Schneider is in a new role: as a director.
positive;The conflict between the two is already fully apparent by the pictures alone.
positive;Not too much action, because the story is also important for this part of the movie.
positive;The cast was cast with unknown actors in this country.
positive;They don't even have a real identity, origin, depth or real motives at Deadpool, why they do what they do now.Spoiler: Especially the accomplice of Ajax (hehe), which remains completely colourless except for the name A little shame, because here you could still get a lot out of the movie.
positive;What you started with in Casino Royale, actually more realism, less frills, is consistently continued in QoS.
negative;Overall, however, exactly these solid action sequences suffer from plausibilitÃ¤t.
positive;The scenario is quickly told an old woman asks to read to her from a diary on the deathbed, it is the diary of her former life-carried Benjamin.
positive;She's doing her thing very well.
positive;It is an entertaining pleasure to look at the revenge on a system, which is to be described by money and injustice.
positive;But the film also does woe for another reason.
positive;One of the best superheroes movies at all.
positive;WOW - how long has it been since I was so excited about a movie after the starting credits?
positive;This sequence belongs to the best in the whole movie.
positive;Kevin Zegers, as Tobey, conveys his character so close that I'm just fascinated by his acting performance in this movie and I hope that I can see him soon for a third time when he finally gets out of here in Germany on DVD....
positive;Of course, you should not generalize, but I have made my own experiences and many clichés were simply confirmed.
positive;With the simplest means Weir created an ingenious, dense corneal atmosphere, which makes the film even better than it would be due to the great moral questions and the grandiose actors anyway.
positive;For this dominating hard-pocketed, angular characters: The rebellion is at the crossroads and the leaders are divided in view of the soon completion of the Death Star.
positive;The fights are fast and great made.
positive;"The lemurs with ""I like to move it"" are also awesome!"
positive;Carolynn avoids all the problems in her marriage by holding Lester at the pole and outside, upholding the illusion of a pefrekten family.
positive;That's Niko's life no more and no less.
positive;In the Resumee, however, this hardly does a stop to the movie.
positive;This is the Splatter film at all.
positive;What his predecessor did wrong, however, is now done better, much better.
negative;Exactly this circumstance saved me personally but the strip.
positive;The director does not write too much national consciousness.
positive;But in advance a little hint: I am a big fan of the great Star Wars universe.
negative;The jokes are obviously no longer written by the same people who worked on previous seasons.
positive;The boy and his replacement father (Weston/Garard Butler) play their role convincingly.
positive;"So much in advance... ...I have to confess that I was a little skeptical - the case after his ""Sweeney Todd"", which I personally consider to be worshipable, I found for Burton in advance already dangerously high."
negative;I think Holmes is being devalued to a distorted, playful character.
positive;And I recommend waking up to them, too.
positive;Tom Cruise shines once again as Ethan Hunt and proves to be an absolute man when it comes to the fight at the highest building in the world in particular, next to it Jeremy Renner as potential successor quite well (the row with Renner's figure is supposed to be continued) and Simon Pegg constantly cares for small, nice laughs.
positive;See what's going on.
positive;You could follow the plot quite well, whereby you have to say again that I already knew the plot from the book.
positive;As a child of the 80s, I naturally grew up with a snortless action cinema.
positive;In my opinion, it's a great innovation.
positive;The directorâ€TMs Cut runs happily round and does not have a hanger, until the time has come for the last service of the Louise von Lengefeld and the great Störmer and DrÃ¤nger.
negative;And in this respect â€žThe Artistâ€œ is colourless and unique.
positive;In general, the film stimulates reflection and that from the very beginning.
positive;Tjoa, after almost a year went back to the cinema, in the right movie, at the right time.
negative;Because if the tank had not stood there, the SS would simply continue to march.
positive;But this is not only the director's merit, one should emphasize above all the acting performance of the actors, especially Jake Gylenhaal, alias Donnie Darko, who plays dreamlike and is certainly irreplaceable in this film.
positive;You can discuss the end, but no one will have to complain that the film leaves a big stamp behind: Continue!
positive;"Despite their differences, a friendship develops between the two, whose strength is put to the test when Julian targets a contract killer half a year later. """
negative;A potential hitchhiker?
positive;The networking of the social elite with the poorest of the poor is also brought to the layman.
positive;All in all, half the rent, where there were enough difficulties with the location for the shooting: In Berlin an unused hospital is available for such productions, but Berlin did not support the film.
positive;It is not as with Spider-Man that Peter Parker gets his hands on his forces and then briefly trains and swoops on criminals hunting.
positive;Sommerset: How would it be if we introduced someone else into the plot, who is like a father for the two friends.
positive;I'm looking forward to Mel Gibson's next movie.
positive;Can't see him often enough!
positive;Just worth seeing!
positive;Many dared not start a topic at first out of fear to catch the wrong spade.
positive;The drama is won only by the situation and the acting, which makes the whole realistic and more rousing effect.
positive;From the first second to the last, the strip convinces with a harmony between music, impressions of the 30's, action and acting performance, which do not give the viewer the slightest hint of boredom.
positive;The film is filmed extensively and technically at the highest level (keyword: weightlessness) Even if there are a few logic puzzles, the story also rises with you, even if it can't completely convince you emotionally.
positive;I'm not a Bruce Willis fan but was absolutely excited about his performance.
positive;Saffron Burrows as a supposedly egoistic model with survival instinct also knows to set accents.
positive;It'll bring new ones in line.
positive;We trust meanwhile technical devices already almost our whole life and our thoughts on.
positive;I also liked the acting performances very well and the music was great for the mood.
negative;so the film is for me very distasteful but two things I especially noticed and these are first of all the new synchronisation voices which really did me doll because they had longed for the old ones over the years and the second one that the film has absolutely little to do with the book and the abilities were totally unspeakable that was a mischief and harry potter comes in the movie RÃ1⁄4ber like a player the glasses is not at all completely unlauded anymore I almost in the cinema vomited this womanly hermine were finally once again for the film the eyebrow removed and this putt-hose ron can also only be seen where he is this wonderful gryffindor combat bath coat trÃ¤gt what I mean with it the eyebrow and this beautiful ron is not to be seen:
positive;P.S.
positive;The red thread is clear.
negative;Thus, the film claps 130 (!)
positive;Of course, some of the action is somewhat inconsistent or you can save yourself.
negative;But Gore effects and good performance of the lead actor hid his lameness.
positive;I recommend this movie with great joy!
negative;3.
positive;No one knew what was coming to him, and yet you have noticed that everyone understands the film as what it is - the best comedy.
negative;In both cases, the scene is absolutely disgusting, since individual fate locks and systematic extermination of groups of people is placed in a context of content that ends in rather clumsy anti-Semitism.
negative;";)"
negative;Good-looking actors who are loved by man/woman, therefore at least 1,5** but story is very weak and the feelings you have at the beginning are far from being kept by the weak acting performance and the weak plot.
positive;Overall, the film is simply scented - as the Berliner says.
positive;"Also I can only follow the very good reviews of ""Looper""."
positive;";-) I call it artistic freedom ;-)"
positive;The camera fluctuates between solid to very good, whereby the very good scenes clearly outweigh.
positive;However, without becoming really insulting, but always with a slight wink.
positive;Reitman managed to realize a loving work out of a simple theme.The film lives from his imaginative implementation and above all from the gradient acting performance of his actors.
positive;In the end, the film could just start over again.
negative;"The film's answer to these questions is simple: ""We are in a parallel universe with other basic physical laws""."
positive;Accordingly, unfortunately, I can't give 10 points, although State of Play certainly was one of the best, if not the best movie that came to the cinema in 2009.
positive;- Finn, a stormtrooper with a conscience.
positive;The cast, apart from Johnny Depp (who should have got an Oscar for the role of the crazy Sparrow) can convince completely.
negative;The conclusion and more criticisms under:
positive;The whole is based on the funny basic idea that the priests must have as much sin as possible to be possessed by demons and then kill themselves in order to feed them, with themselves, into the hell.
positive;Who believes that the film is only a thriller about the shooting bin Ladens from a very American point of view, which supports the film by far.
positive;The latter was above all quite grandiose, because Nolan thought it so, that one experiences the events from three different perspectives.
positive;Surely you need a slightly longer breath in order not to lose the thread in such a movie, but this is a challenge to the viewer and finally an absolutely wild two-hour roller coaster ride.
positive;The story is a consistent continuation of the previous films.
positive;Respect.. they harmonize dreamlike with each other..sad that it does not correspond to the reality!
negative;A certain seriousness also lacks the final sequence.
negative;Conclusion: â€šVictoriaâ€TM is not worth seeing unless you want to see a 240-minute film without editing and what comes out of it.
negative;(even if I wish one could) But with the success of the books the films were preprogrammed.
positive;However, the film is also nothing for very weak people and I think also not suitable for my life danger.
positive;Great twist super characters super effects.
negative;A film that has to accept the accusation of absolute inconsistency.
positive;'The ninth company' is a successful film about a troop of Russian soldiers in the war between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.
negative;Totally wasted lifetime!
positive;This film is so authentic that in some places I really had tears in my eyes.
positive;Actually, all fans should be damn happy that there is a real movie, because the Transformers are actually pretty sucked out.
positive;Is she just a rich woman's game ball?
positive;Every now and then, even on foreign topics such as the deadly tobacco consumption and the HIV virus, this causes a very interesting aftertaste.
positive;Tell nächtern without evaluating or explaining.
positive;Part though the mainstream most suitable Star Trek film is, but also ingrained trekkies as I would like very much.
positive;It's almost creepy how embarrassing exactly these characters occur in my environment, partly with the same, confused stories.
positive;How can it be that Lincoln's sponsor will let his clone drive after he realizes that the outside world has little idea?
positive;Because the dialogue and details loadiness is still being pushed to the top here.
positive;"Sure, the people of the MNU say that right in front of the camera; then it must be true..."
positive;So'n Oscar film halt: Director Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Meryll Streep in the leading roles, the latter nominated for an Oscar, and a real case depicting ... joa, as was to be expected, just so that one would have nominated the worthy Steven even more.
positive;Quickly still in the cinemas, before he can no longer be seen there :D
positive;"I'm not going to go into details of the movie now because I'm honestly too lazy ;) From me 9 out of 10 points."
positive;Conclusion: Short, funny, exciting, skurill, bloody, unconventional - everything is true and everything works!
negative;Conclusion: Too many actions that come together with a somehow very unsympathetic figure.
positive;In the fourth part you will also have its true joy, as well at the awesome action scenes, which - of course - are absolutely over-the-top.
negative;Viola Davis must have done something hugely wrong.
positive;Too bad this movie isn't so well known, because it's one of the 10 best movies of all time.
negative;That's why the joke is too short.
negative;1. the film was fully synchronized (at least the copy in the Cineplex) - why this is the question... finally the trilingualism was an important stylistic means 2. boring love story between the opera singer and the opera singer 3. the film is very superficial.
positive;The musical background in moving moments was a sure grip but nevertheless similar to Hollywood, which contributed to the overall athmosphere phasewise.
positive;How this honest, good woman sacrifices herself for her child seems superhuman, but if one thinks a little bit about it, one realizes how true all this could be.
positive;But since it is not fast enough for the members (uncle and aunt) they engage Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angela (Michelle Monaghan) to find the child.
positive;But... unbelievably good pictures, a soundtrack that is pressurized in the cinema chair and good acting performances by almost all actors.
positive;Elyas MÂ ́barek and Karoline Herfurth also do their job well.
positive;For that he is wise.
positive;All these interpretations can be seen in the mixture of home invasion thriller, horror movie and satire - while I am already wondering why so many people attest to the movie humor.
positive;If you want to see a gangster thriller that doesn't turn into a comedy like so many others, you just have to see this movie!
positive;Conclusion: A small, fine and mean movie.
positive;Even today, I can remember very well individual scenes.
positive;As in many other films, the main character here must prove his innocence.
positive;My happy grin was from there at least not to get out of my face.
positive;Only delicately inspired leisure-men will this movie not agree!
positive;It is essential that there should be a future for each other.
positive;I didn't know it was going to be like this...
positive;Memento thus remains continuously high-tensioning from the first to the last minute and leaves the viewer no time to breathe.
positive;As if the everyday comic structuralist Jacques Tati and the relationship realist Eric Rohmer had arranged to meet in Vienna...
positive;9/10
negative;Agent movies are really great!
negative;A farce and caricature that makes the evil presence of the nasty beasts puff like a fart in the wind and degrades them to comic figures (remembers very unpleasantly of misadvised game-mountain ideas such as e.g.
positive;Conclusion: Tuning and very entertaining popcornkino and an excellent lead actor and few Schwächen.
positive;The movie really went to heart.
positive;Jared Leto finally got the opportunity to play a different role than the boring darling and mastered the task surprisingly well.
positive;Keep it up, Mr. Dolan!
positive;Soundtrack is awesome (Dropkick Murphys, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones..), Stars, Stars, all Super!
positive;And as with the story, the action has knocked me down the chinlade several times and every time I thought I saw the highlight of the movie, one was put on it.
positive;No deep dialogues, no long history, just action, knocking on from front to back.
negative;Conclusion: No film you must have seen.
positive;This shows that there are only rarely gay relationships between cowboys.
positive;The protagonists of the individual storylines fit perfectly into their respective environment.
positive;A really good comedy!
positive;That we are.
positive;This results in an extremely high entertainment value, and it makes fun to watch Raimi's creative ideas.
positive;In these rocky, branched catacombs, primitives grow up, which is perfectly underlined by the stick-dark images, rarely illuminated by light torches.
positive;"Actually, it should be a work that everyone is happy (in my school the film became a mandatory event on World AIDS Day) and everyone will have seen it once – and if not, you should definitely.Conclusion: Painful death drama and grandiose court movie â€"" moving and class!"
positive;Really highly recommended!
positive;It comes rather like 2 very different friends who tell about meaning and nonsense of your life, and let the spectator - quite beside beian - participate in a very unusual working day of their life.
positive;Classic & KULT ?
positive;23 is empathetic, perfectly timed, great played and really masterfully filmed.
negative;5/10!
negative;There is no atmosphere at all, the film doesn't bother me, it lacks depth, I don't find access to the characters, the landscape seems artificial, the acting in large parts hears.... Conclusion: NO THANK YOU!
negative;Helen Mirren plays everything in the ground and doesn't even have to retrieve her maximum.
positive;â€œThe film is specialâ€œ sounds like a nice description for â€œthe film is disabledâ€œ.
negative;I'm done.
positive;I already saw the movie on Thursday and now I'm going to write my opinion.
negative;That with the end was exceptionally kept to the basic script allows me to give the film two instead of just one point.
positive;The actors - above all old masters De Niro and Pacino - play in best form, the score fits harmoniously into the action, transports the emotions as it should be and consists to a large extent of synthetic edges (e.g.
positive;All in all, a wonderful film that leaves its world unexplored enough to stimulate the imagination.
positive;"But ""So dark the night"" convinced me from the first to the last minute."
positive;I saw both the BBC filming as well as the one from 1940 and must say that none was as vivid and realistic as this one.
positive;Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp were the ideal cast for this movie.
negative;* Although I like the X-Men characters and their movies very much, Logan's story left me cold like a dog snout this time.
positive;Who likes funny dialogues and can laugh at Monty Pythons is right here!
positive;The boondock saints rock and that without hollywood-pr-machine!!
positive;But I think this one point is not worth a whole point!!!
negative;But not a single horror action happens here until 10 minutes before the end!
positive;Eric Banna also perfect in his role!
positive;That's all you need to say.
positive;Who knows who knows what material is still waiting for us for the release as Director's Cut.
positive;In intensity and perfection, this scene is no longer to be surpassed and allows the viewer to swim back and forth.
positive;Everything you need, humor, tension, drama and love has been packed into this film.
positive;After a long, little effectful intro (which starts with the childhood of her WATER...) the film slowly gets on its way after about 30 minutes.
positive;Great movie!
negative;Now we have him the senseless, totally unexciting movie that eigtl didn't need... and yet everyone runs to the movies to see Brad & Clooney.
positive;"Ggr... ; )"
positive;What only stops, despite the captivating, confusing story: The logical aspect!
negative;Through the bank away it lacks however of really cool situations, intelligent dialogues or also something like a supporting score.
positive;For example, the outstanding Ellie Arroway played by Jodie Foster is called Jill Tarter in real life and is a respected and respected astronomer in her professional circles.
positive;Tom Cruise's journey through the night is a feast for the eyes, confusing and magical at the same time.
positive;Basically good, but unfortunately abused.
negative;After a few months I felt the urge to take my life, because my sadness, whose reason I did not know myself, was so immensely great and I never thought I could be happy in my life again.
positive;I don't think the logic words are so important in such films.
positive;A brutal spectacle for eyes and ears.
positive;The movie made me appreciate how rarely it is possible to do movies.
positive;What remains is the question, masterpiece or not?
positive;For campers.
negative;"The soundtrack, however, is really good, only a little bit intrusive individually and the scene with the song ""Nirvana - Smells like teen spirit"" is not to be overbidden in lack of clarity and you would have been able to save yourself completely."
positive;Genial Story Genially implemented.
positive;Sinister has caused the same positive feeling in me and I can only mention very clearly at the beginning of this review: strong performance!
negative;But I give him the half because as I said, he just put a parr class and I felt well entertained
positive;On arrival on â€ ¬Faraway Downsâ€œ the mood changes, now it is serious if ever, even if a few (intentional) jokes are installed again and again.
positive;Watching Theodore Twombly walk through the streets of a not too distant future with his bright shirts and slowly learning again what it means to love and live is simply wonderful.
positive;"""2 Days Paris"" feels like a modern, European reinterpretation of the once very popular Screwball comedy in America."
positive;In order not to betray too much here, look at the strip in any case!!
positive;just right for hours to two
positive;In my view, it is a very successful film, which I have seen several times to this day.
positive;The whole is brought over so that one as viewer again and again fluctuates back and forth.
negative;At the first time still quite nice, at the second time probably rather overwhelming.
negative;I often felt like I was in a silent movie, and the movie became boring.
positive;even if waltz delivers almost a one-man-show and thus attracts the greatest attention, it is nevertheless a film that leaves a more than good impression in the whole.
negative;For Mark Wahlberg, however, this psychopathic boy has been a good springboard.
positive;They're just perfectly chosen.
positive;1.: a super powerful acting performance is offered to you!
negative;If you already advertise the movie as Prequel and it is actually no one at the end.
positive;ALso....at once look and enjoy!!
negative;I therefore think this film is mercilessly overshadowed, but put it to everyone who can enjoy di Caprio with naked upper body in kitsch colors and away from any inner and outer logic.
positive;A better score would have by the way more binding to the story and the characters can create.
negative;There are many ambiguities and everything is confused in the film, although everything is explained in the end, but as it turns out, this is just as unspectacular and boring as the whole film.
positive;To be honest, I can't understand why the movie is supposed to be a disaster, as other critics call it, just because it's alluded to in the moods, etc.
positive;I thought the movie was super funny.I was laughing almost all the time.
negative;Naomi Rapace masters this challenge quite well and manages to play every character so differently, that at least I often forget that this is actually always the same actress.
positive;Be it the restless pacing of the film, its great atmosphere or the curious events the Raimi gradually peels out of the sleeve.
positive;[...]â€žThe Walkâ€œ is a film full of joie de vivre, winking and engaging when Joseph Gordon-Levitt invites one from the torch top of the Statue of Liberty to accompany the multi-annual path to his legendary walk.
positive;Lukas ́ life is shaken with it.
positive;She only acts briefly, in a wheelchair, in a bed, talks, moves her arms.
positive;The course of the action is more or less predictable, but always comes up with surprises.
positive;I watched the movie with my daughter, 9 years old, and since then it's her favorite movie.
positive;It's worth it.
negative;Who hopes for a certain magic in the movie can wait a long time.
positive;Of course there are unfortunately too many new faces about which one could also shoot an X Men movie, but then we will probably still see X Men Origins parts in the cinema in 30 years.
positive;- the length.
positive;exciting, action-packed, magnificent to watch...perfect cinema entertainment.
positive;The story is quite predictable, but an outstanding leading actress and almost continuous action make the film an entertaining and entertaining movie.
positive;"Anyway, who makes both and the cast really expects a solid and ""serious"" film is anyway to blame."
positive;And what the film misses at the beginning of tension is getting better and better with the ongoing film.
negative;(That's what you do with prisoners in Starfleet.)
positive;Lots of action, great pictures and beautiful story.
positive;It's about the Chinese drug boss Timmy Choi, who has been caught by a car accident in the hands of the police and is now waiting for the death penalty because of his drug offenses.
positive;"Very big cinema; or also ""Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
positive;As if you were live with it.
negative;Why not?
positive;Don't miss, gosh!
positive;would see it again at any time!!!!
positive;And yet the incredibly beautiful pictures fascinated me.
positive;... Oh how forgetful, I am not married at all') also provide for exhilarating moments.
positive;Super Mix of Kill Bill, Watchmen&Marvel Comics and Coming of Age - movies, such as Superbad.
positive;The story is well-known and knows to come along especially in the second half.
positive;A breathtaking mix of different genres, such as action, comedy, splatter, drama, satire and a bit of horror and remains in the heart a romantic film.
positive;Of course, the director invented nothing new when he shot the film in the form of pseudo-documentation.
positive;Approach monoperspective, very one-sided or with fabled bytaste, so many criticisms!
negative;In this case, the purpose does not justify the means.
negative;It is a shrewd strip that Richard Shepard staged there: a mixture of black comedy, drama and thriller.
positive;At the end, however, the film turns into a hard-hitting thriller and even I was very impressed at the end, as if the showdown was overwhelming and exciting – even if the end is rather unsatisfactory.
negative;That's something for Sunday drivers.
negative;Unfortunately, director and screenwriter Rodrigo CortÃ©s go through the horses.
positive;I'm gonna go back to the movies tomorrow and watch it again.
positive;"For fans of Underworld and vampire films, the film ^^ The film taps to the end of the 1st part, which makes the story beautiful continues...Kate Beckinsale as Selene looks really sharp ;D There are many chars coming."
negative;They're boring and unspectacular.
positive;The worst thing about the movie is that Topher Grace alias Venom with very little screen time quite loose Maguire stares the show, because this boy has what Maguire does not have, charisma!
positive;Jeremy Mockridge is the upper hammer that is sooo sweet!Well, unfortunately, he's too young for me!But he's soo mega hammer horny!
positive;I have seen the film before a long time ago and was enthusiastic about the great equipment, supposed to be called from the harsh scenic beauty and the rooms with these rusrikal furniture.
positive;On the other hand, a not entirely new, but hardly illuminated feature of the gene combination is once tried to be incorporated into a film.
negative;Ees also gives other movies on which you can save.
negative;Here comes the film of the year 2007: Sunshine, a pseudophilosophical work with a story drawn by the hair and unrivalled by logic/physical errors.
negative;For this reason, it is also revealed at the beginning what is to be done at the end (Moses Tables of the Law).
positive;It is to be based on two True Events.
negative;In general, there were so many parallels to â€žDeja vuâ€œ or â€žThe Jacketâ€œ, only that much more remains in the dark, especially as far as technology is concerned, because as far as steel is concerned, one will probably never know.
positive;Man, the movie's killing you!!
positive;The action scenes are gigantic!
positive;So who can or is offered it on site.
positive;Yeah.
positive;However, one should not be sagitated in such a way, because the filmmakers really take part in the bottom drawer with their gags.
positive;The finest of superhero popcorn cinema.
positive;FAZIT: In this way Jenkyn's film has his quirks (dinner Bösewicht, too naive Diana and could have been 20 minutes earlier), so she manages to find an ideal middle way in many areas.
positive;we have also spoken in the school still very much about it, about the actual topic actually the at all times existing danger by atomic power plants.
negative;3.
positive;A bad subject, cruel images, incredible that it really was once.
negative;That didn't work out, so it comes to a brachial attack of the actual genius without superiority.
positive;"This is precisely the genius of Hitoshi Matsumoto; it is not about the apparent film and the story itself, because it merely serves as a demonstration of the statement."
positive;Particularly noteworthy are Kevin Spacey as boss and Jamie Foxx, who just has a lot of fun here as a bad boy.
negative;For the demanding cinema visitors it is nothing, because to thin, immoral (dream > risk of the family) is as illogical.
positive;"Hey, even if the story after the release of Adam ""The Tank"" Brody is quite wobbly (was partly too much of a baller), it was a great movie."
positive;I thought the movie was great.
positive;A little throbbing and predictable but with a top cast and a few laughs are there.
positive;it is one of the most horrifying horror films I have ever seen with my friends, and we have already drawn in almost all more or less known horror films... (saw 1+2, creep, helloween, silent of the lambs, pschyco ...) the 2nd part we will also borrow soon.
positive;now the boy comes with his second - self-directed - film around the corner and leaves me surprised at the end back.
positive;After a long time finally another action thriller of the old school.
positive;Successful cast but somehow that's not enough, mood doesn't want to come up to the last instance, there are logic puzzles and somehow I miss the last consistent flair of a Dracula.
positive;"Only in the finale there are some fantasy and horror elements, otherwise ""Indiana Jones and the last Crusade"" is almost quite ground-breaking."
positive;Even if you haven't seen part 1, you understand almost everything
positive;The competitive behavior of the Nightcrwler among themselves only to catch the perfect story and without fear of losses.
positive;"""Moneyball"" is a very entertaining drama with a good-tempered and convincing Brad Pitt in the leading role!"
negative;I don't have it and it's absolutely incomprehensible to me.
positive;Ask for answers if anyone had any idea!!
positive;Two different worlds meet, but they understand each other immediately.
positive;the end is at least not as I expected, but very good and fits well with the rest of the movie.
positive;The movie is so incredibly appealing.
negative;I went to the cinema with very high expectations, since the comparison with Casino Royale Immanuel was already very high in my eyes.
positive;The criticism about the credibility in the film is not justified in my opinion.
positive;The actors are all top.
negative;Kills should be better than capture?
positive;But I would like to miss out less on the sensational acting performances of all the actors - above all, of course, de Niro and Pacino.
negative;While Arkin used to annoyed trying to scare people off.
positive;Awesome!!!
positive;Because the films and, above all, Transformers don't deserve that.
positive;One day Max inherits a house with a vineyard from his uncle Henry (Albert Finney).
positive;In the beginning he seems quite banana, because the feeling comes up quickly one would only see a typical space conquest film again, but the actors are very good and the representation of the feelings allows a really great dive into the film completely.
positive;also for this movie with michael dougles 5 stars a super performance an exciting story and uncut
positive;The Chinese don't get away so well, so I can understand that they were a little angry...
negative;Star Wars is interpreted here rather as a children's film, but it shouldn't really be.
positive;It's a very controversial work.
positive;"The ""Panem"" series is a rare special case for me: it is the case where a story is hyped, but with everything is also a proper work and a solid basis behind it."
positive;The story is consistent, uncomplicated, exciting and does not contain any logical mistakes.
positive;There are some scenes or quotes that I have in my head again and again and I think that's a good movie out of which he stays in his head afterward and you deal with him.
positive;As in the original, the remake of Evil Dead does not offer an absolutely captivating plot (which a horror film does not necessarily need), but is nevertheless excitingly staged and promises no boredom under guarantee.
negative;"if I want to fact, I go to the bib ;-)"
positive;Never, I'll just say it now.
negative;Why don't we see the haunted festivities of the Elbs in the forest of the DÃ1⁄4ster?
positive;==References==
positive;He had a lot of fun watching this movie.
positive;What do we really know about the world and what happens on this and when we know it, how long does it interest us?
positive;You've played both of them very well.
negative;"""Well,"" you think in the end."
positive;The film tries to illustrate the problems and mistakes of the Iraq war to the viewer through impressive dialogues.
positive;"At the appearance of the ""Masamunen-Schwinger"" even tears flowed and I myself was about to cry in some scenes."
positive;It just fits everything in this movie he pulls his own line from beginning to end through what I think is awesome.
positive;Some partly satirical comments of the chractists not only show their insides, but also encourage to think about their situatuin.
negative;But nevertheless, I also find some positive points in the whole number.
positive;is familiar, or after watching the film reads through the true events, but will quickly find that one has composed much of dramaturgical reasons and has greatly simplified the political circumstances.
positive;Totally beautiful film, love in detail, great equipment.
positive;HELL, a fim that rightly belongs in the cinema.
positive;But one thing has to be considered: if you see this film you should pay attention to it that it is the 20 minutes longer â€€œ director's cutâ€œ version â€ , so that the â€€œ scene becomes more meaningful for me and my former math table neighbor Adam â€œRing Trickâ€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€
negative;If you're going to hold on to it for so long.
positive;The U.S. Congress and the government had - only from the motive of maintaining their own neutrality during the Napoleonic wars in Europe and for their own protection had had no reason to have a warship built on one of their own shipyards for any of the European warring powers (even for the old devotees from the independence war) - certainly not from the extremely valuable and rare possessions of the Virginia oaks, from which the American frigates were built.
positive;The guys wars forces and play with it it is suddenly extra edge and band device because one of the guys was always abused by his father!
positive;Top
negative;You didn't have to grumble.
positive;The plot leads you skillfully around the nose, which I have missed since SAW 1 anyway painfully.
negative;But nevertheless you will neither warm with the exchangeable characters nor skin one the story of the socks, but gives itself ultimately satisfied with the simple shock effects to pull through, especially when murder greedy mutants control the ship.
negative;Also the plot has a beautiful surprise!
positive;Take off your glasses.
positive;I find the film perfect.
positive;Here they are much more loving.
positive;"Michael's friends have affinities, they don't get along with the separation from the ex, or with the fact that they're father....also that's the most normal stories in the world...just like Jenna's parents, who only live next to each other after 30 years... And precisely because it's all so normal, so really, so resemblable, ""The last Kiss"" is a beautiful movie, which you can understand and which you can think about even if you've seen and heard it a thousand times."
positive;Overall, I liked him well to very much.
positive;A really ingenious action comedy, enjoying cult status and getting it right!
positive;Roman Polanski has created a great work with this film.
positive;There they must fight against a mummy, which eats the souls of the old.
positive;You also notice to the main actor that they are in their element.
positive;The cinema visitor is guided behind the scenes of a man whose media self-presentation, combined with the staging of his products in front of his million-fold fan community â€ , in the hall or in the live stream or later at youtube (steve jobs presentation) - already has something sacred in itself.
negative;Not because the story is so complex, but unfaithful.
negative;Friedrich, alias always to the point actor gwisdeck, gives the film the rest.
negative;, Killer (From Dusk) , Lawyer (Hardfall), Depp (Burn After Reading), Soldier and Treasurer (Three Kings) , Smart Gangster (Out of Sight , Oceans11,12,13) or now as a word carter , Mißrauischer Profikiller.
positive;The telling by way of shows.man has continuous tension and action.
positive;Since the film is not generally explained until the end, it leaves plenty of room for interpretations and, which some might not like.
positive;And to say it in advance, I think Andrew Garfield is cooler than Tobey Maguire than Spiderman for worlds.
positive;And yet his son receives from him something that other sons may not get from their fathers: hope and imagination.
positive;Perfect emotional cinema.
positive;Telly Savalas also gives me the best Blofeld.
positive;Once you've seen Machete, you know, it's pretty much all right here.
positive;A moody and cheerful summer comedy, cut from the beginning to a â€œ target audienceâ€œ and made in TV format and quality â€ , so the expectations of history ect.
positive;A film that closes the hearts and leaves behind a smile under tears.
negative;7.
negative;For the students of Hogwarts it is obligatory to wear their enclosures within the school.
negative;I found the film very original, because you can see this in many other high-time films too and therefore the end was quickly predictable.
positive;With 2001, Stanley Kurbick created probably by far the best sci-fi film of all time.
positive;Not as far as their acting is concerned!
positive;An unusually unpathetic war movie with a great Alicia Vikander.
positive;So if you're in a bad mood, you just have to go into this movie...the mood is certainly changing abruptly!
positive;I can understand who the guy doesn't feel, but I looked over it.
positive;Viewed with distance he is admittedly bored.
positive;Although the race shares and the agent story don't harmonize with each other (especially since the car races really didn't interest me very much), but the wonderful agent-persiflage let me be feverish until the end and even surprised at the end.
positive;During the course of the action there are many turns that make one believe again and again in another explanation or another outcome.
positive;He likes more and you want to find out more.
positive;The scene in the restaurant is unlikely to remind you of Miss Doubtfire, especially if he suspects the clothes to be confused there was no stop!
positive;My wife was different.
negative;That's why I already went very critical in this movie.
positive;Five points, great....
positive;The film captivates from beginning to end.
negative;Keep each other quiet.
negative;This is done in the style of war of the worlds, The day after tomorrow, 2012, Independence Day, Contagion, Invasion... etc. I think the list could be extended by some titles.
positive;a lot of action .
positive;In my opinion has earned several Oscars and awards!!
positive;It shows on-going sportiness and a psychologically interesting unpredictability.
positive;Very funny movie you can watch with the whole family.
negative;stops after the movie.
positive;Today, her creativity and healing is more popular than ever before and her compositions, which also appear in the film, have been experiencing a renaissance for years.
positive;Big movie!
negative;In any case a lot was filmed with the money, after all one spends for the film over two and a half hours (plus advertising) in the cinema chair.
positive;Johnny Depp plays the leading role again, as he did twice before for Tim Burton.
positive;My girlfriend, who was there, had read the book.
positive;"Only ""Pan's Labyrinth"" gave me a little more advice."
positive;Thereby brother and sister have no good relationship or actually no relationship with her father, to which the two have for years no longer have any contact.
positive;For Fulms like this love and enjoy the European cinema
negative;Conclusion: Passable approach, but totally bulky and me lead actor staged!
positive;The effects and actors go perfectly fine.Very nice strip and worth seeing!
negative;Who expects a brullkomische comedy, however, is defamed.
positive;Absolutely watch, a wonderful film that also reveals a lot of criticism of the (American) way of life.
negative;The basic equipment and principle of the film is quite interesting and as a spectator one comes again and again in the grumbling, what one would probably do so everything.
positive;(Whereby Helge Schneider sometimes unpacks the absolute brullers, the two would certainly fit together well in a movie) As soon as Leslie Nielsen or Frank Drebin comes into the picture, I start to laugh broken, the guy is just absolutely awesome!
negative;Honestly, how in the world can you give this movie 8 out of 10 points on average?!
negative;Somehow I couldn't make friends with the movie.
negative;Simply ridiculous.
positive;The hall laughed, trembled with excitement and left the cinema with a really good feeling.
positive;<3 I can just recommend this movie!
positive;wow the movie is so awesome, isn't it?
negative;Up to a certain point its acting sophistication is not quite as mature as with some other colleagues, but Johnson is very well aware of this and cares also here again that one can not be bad to him, even despite the absurd script.
positive;But most recently after the quantum leap in the last third(?)
positive;Pink is somewhat dissatisfied with his name.
negative;From Disney nothing bad can come, for that were produced to good movies of it!
positive;I'm going to take a look at the other two parts of trilogy.
negative;Conclusion: don't waste your time and money on this movie.
positive;Particularly noteworthy is the constantly maintained tension, which is maintained by only two main persons.
positive;The last third picks up tremendously, especially through splatter scenes, as they were certainly not yet seen in a German-language production.
negative;Not for demanding cinema fans with bit to high expectations!
positive;It's definitely worth watching, the movie money is worth it.
positive;very good action and special effects, actors and their performances are top up in the smallest supporting role and the humor is also not too short.
positive;And Raymond's probably superhero!
positive;Of course, if you have a Prof.in physics, there are already some places somewhat questionable, but my God, this is a film that should entertain us and I was entertained in full lengths of the film.
negative;What was said, how was acted and why, was secondary.
positive;But this movie seemed different and I wasn't unmasked.
negative;Basically, I like movies with historical backdrop, scenes and action.
positive;Only the emotional entanglements of the dream-like main actor let rise up here and there Gänsehaut and give an idea of what an abstract-elaborating dream labyrinth is capable of, which strengthens the spectator himself in a small sense crisis and raises existential questions that Nolan might have escaped from us.Always the psychological illumination of the main characters and the associated manipulations are atmospherically dense and convincing.
positive;Even in the first scenes, drastic means are used to provide the viewer with a real picture.
positive;Overall, a very successful film.
positive;I don't understand the reviews Don't bend the story with a bad end and so on.
positive;After the disaster in the Kremlin, the IMF is completely dissolved.
positive;His pointed jack arms and his most amusing comments lead to the Captain America and Thor becoming almost extras.
positive;The whole thing is captured not only miraculously by the camera, but also exciting without end!
positive;Robots have stayed back to clean the earth.
positive;Mia Wasikowska as near-adult Alice is also a discovery: just as she is fascinated by all the wonder delusions around her, because she rediscovers the wonderland, because she now leaves her first trip there as an ever-recurring dream fantasies so they have to decide what is the best not only for the wonderland but also for her.
negative;But you can look at it.
positive;the half a little before it to plätschern.
positive;I am completely incomprehensible why there is talk in the criticism of vampires and garlic.
negative;"The ""herbs "" are not necessarily part of that philosophy, therefore, they are, God helps instantly, shot to porridge."
negative;Well, the scene is original, the bizarre characters partly quite well occupied, but all in all, what's above average about the movie?
negative;The good ones must finally win and the bosses get all their just punishment- very realistic.
negative;And even more so if 3 people from a distance of 1 meter with uzis shoot at you.
positive;"Drawn ""Küss den Frog"" at old Disney classics and yet is somehow more modern."
positive;I mean, of course, a part of the pattern has remained (I'm not saying which part!
negative;Too bad!
positive;"I can recommend this movie to everyone who would like to return to the ""good old humor"", have a soft spot for crazy but lovable characters and also do not want to miss the good technique of a blockbuster."
positive;Thank you, Mr.
positive;Stoker is such a movie where I would like to have more options between 4 and 5 stars.
positive;The movie really makes terror.
positive;==References==
positive;I wanted to watch the film, although the complete subtitle was known to me in advance, in the original way so by the way.
positive;The first thing to do when watching the film is of course the crazy comic look.
negative;After the really cool trailer I didn't expect you to bring the story from A to Z so uninspired.
positive;------------------------------------- Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Black's best-known works are in the cover of detective history.
positive;In addition, 3D is an absolute duty, since the deep effect makes sense here.
positive;It dissolves into millions of crabs, makes nine strudels later?
positive;Very horny!
positive;Really good movie :-)
positive;For the most part, Little Miss Sunshine is simply a matter of taste, but for me it's an insider tip!
negative;I'm actually built close to the water, but the movie didn't affect me so emotionally.
positive;"When Kurt Russell AND Kevin Costner play as ""Elvis-Imitators"", then in my opinion nothing bad could come out of it."
negative;That's nothing new.
negative;It was partly worked with great attention to detail.
positive;A film where one doesn't get boring, as he gives important background information in scenes that don't include action.
positive;Here Jackson not only sets us spectacular show values but also a suspenseful story that the spectator after the 3.
negative;"The story restricts itself to „get out of the car, kill and continue to drive"" and does not manage to convince at all."
positive;"""False Confessor"" is far from ""pseudo-intelectual""."
positive;Would interest me, how many of the extras have been lying really flat afterwards.
positive;"I'd have wanted to have another 1-2 more ""tricks""."
positive;While other so-called superstars are only concerned about looking as good as possible and acting cool, here is only about the moment!
negative;Wow, Mr. Spielberg.
positive;Of course, I was most curious about the visual implementation of the pictures, which really sets new standards in computer technology and conjures up fantastic things on the canvas that you have never seen before.
negative;There would of course be such a mobile phone cap as that of the too few phones completely absurd.
positive;During the film, I wonder how many people are doing like April & Frank... dreams of something big... dreams of something special... unique...
positive;But such trivialities do not scratch on the overall work.
positive;This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC!
negative;Was the plan that Hanna gets arrested and kills in the hearer Marissa, flees and afterwards drinks a coffee with Eric in Berlin or what?
positive;Romantic?
positive;I bought the movie the first time I saw it on DVD the next day!!!!!
positive;In addition, one of the best finals there is.
positive;Respect!
negative;Otherwise, in my opinion, there is nothing against filming this life, even if it goes straight up after the career break.
negative;In between you doubt even the human nature of the main protagonist since this can obviously also talk with dogs (what the dogs have to mean is naturally also not explained).
positive;You can only congratulate the makers on this work and wish Justin Bieber and his team a lot of success.
positive;In addition, the spectator finds out more about the home town of Zion and the people living there.
positive;Brad Bitt: Cool, Ryan Gosling: Great, Steve Carell: That's his best performance!
positive;The story is about a boy who killed his sister in a brutal way on a Halloween night.
positive;A typical film you can expect on a Wednesday at the Linden-Theater (in fact the film was there, but played on the evening of Germany) ... an unbelievably successful mixture of road movie, funny comedy, self-discovery and family drama.
negative;Those who are looking for a differentiated exploration of feeling worlds in the film, sit in the completely wrong cinema hall.
positive;In part, the film seems to be a little pessimistic with the man's almost fateful failure, but it is precisely this harsh attitude towards things that stylizes Antonioni into images of absolute desolation that create a dense atmosphere and thus captivate the viewer on the way to (necessary) death.
positive;Unbelievable that an ex prize boxer has gained as much fame and honor as Braddock, who before him and after him no one has managed and still as an old man in the business carried away so many profits, a rarity.
positive;Also the story is grandiosely told and becomes not a single second long breathing.
positive;"Worth seeing and thinking also for figure skating enthusiasts and ""ice skating hats""."
positive;But some people don't seem to be right!
positive;There's a lot of talk I usually don't like.
positive;And leave me a comment!
positive;It was not only full of action, but also very funny.
positive;story could be real, not such a far-fetched stuff.
positive;This effect is underlined above all by a partly suggestive camera work.
positive;Overall, I can recommend the film to all adults.
positive;"FAZIT: A well-staged film that inspires to think about guilt, sin, revenge, pedophilia, self-justice, death penalty, dangers on the Internet and much more, with good actors and a quite sloppily plott for me, especially through his final resolution at the end (""just the same Erin said about you"" or so), which some apparently have not seen any more."
positive;"But from the big showdown it becomes a little too clichéd and predictable, and in the ""Epilog"" a really kitschy and superficial happy ending follows, so to speak."
positive;John Cusack remains true to himself: he only takes over the roles that he likes or which bring him something - and somehow the middle rope are primarily small, silent roles in equally silent films.
positive;However, these passages make up the atmosphere of the book.
positive;Conclusion: Eraserhead is probably one of the darkest and most disturbing films in film history.
negative;Damn it, why do all in the beginning good sci-fi action movies always have to be so terribly flat and illogical?!?
positive;I guess I wasn't the only one: for me, the booted cat has been the screen since he entered the show's highlight in the second Shrek film and always the funniest figure.
negative;Rey is a too played Marry Sue, while Phasma is nothing.
positive;Hugh Grant is back!
positive;Don't miss it in the movies!
negative;The beginning is very interesting, the end fitting.
positive;Also remarkable: although it is actually a duller and hard gangster thriller he has in a sympathetic way a certain humor inside which makes him seem entertaining and loose.
positive;The effects have all succeeded well.
positive;One is emotionally immersed in this strange - and brutal - world, in which cruelties are presented as side-effects or at least self-understanding, so that one really does not get rid of the happening.
negative;The story is lame and the action is not exactly a reparation... FAZIT: a well-equipped film (kostueme) with nice pictures (London, city, interior room, Comp.Anim.
negative;Batman promises Superman to save his mom and the two will immediately become big friends.
positive;As bad is the movie not the shock moments are also not always predictable as written in criticism.
positive;Sometimes I found the movie really class(okay for those who don't know the game, incomprehensible and meaningless), e.g. one wonders why suddenly the animals rush out, why does the radio and the mobile phone crackle, what is with the end, so hacked off etc.
positive;funny German comedy.
positive;The effects are not always outstanding, but contribute to style or humor and never look bad.
positive;And the real Stauffenberg was another monarchist who faithfully served his country (not Hitler!
positive;Conclusion: also for a kinogÃ¤ngerin like me, who actually doesn ́t like dramen - whole, very big cinema.
positive;"The finale has then again decent lengths, although it has not completely achieved the intensity of the New York â€ , fight out of part one, but nevertheless a brilliant battle portrait and the disintegration idea ""Conquer Earth with Earth""."
positive;Goodman plays his choleric Vietnam veteran friend, who is quick to calm down and brings the Dude with his unusual ideas even further into the Bredouille than he already is.
positive;At least not all of them.
positive;I've never done it before.
positive;If you're not excited yet... then these films are nothing for you.
positive;morale is always the essence of the more powerful.
negative;His daughter changes the company and leads her life elsewhere.
positive;"""12 Years A Slave"" is a movie that you have to see because of the circumstances, but you have to have a very strong stomach and strong nerves in order to be able to endure the slave drama filmed by Steven McQueen in all its sad true hardness."
positive;I had never let myself be enthused for Batman I always found this too childish but one evening I watched this movie with my brother I was thrilled.
negative;"Somehow the whole thing seems as if one had put a few ""Akte-X"" episodes and the ""Matrix"" series in front and then asked them to tell the content."
positive;"The saying ""Treums are dreams"" fits here like a fist on the eye."
positive;But he is not the only one who gives the work its perfection.
positive;Unfortunately I couldn't see the movie in the cinema, but now on DVD.
positive;So there is a Christmas atmosphere, a small town atmosphere, which I stand for.
negative;Have the short film on my â€œNightmare before Christmasâ€œ DVD.
positive;In advance it should be said that I will not deal here with the content, but with the assessments and the reasons.
positive;'Conan' describes a world that is so familiar and whose simplicity and roughness emanates from a fascination that can hardly be grasped in words, but rather finds its expression in the encapsulation of Schwarzenegger.
positive;It is nice to see how long the friendships of the four women have lasted through decades and they are still there for each other today.
positive;There lies the questioning audience at least stoned on the mattress!
positive;This spell often loses itself in the course of life through reason, through learning or other reasons.
positive;Because what's at stake here is not the future of humanity, no, it's Star Trek itself!
negative;The Stirb Slow row has always been smoothed by its naturality and should have left it there too.
positive;Not to forget the supporting actors Alexander Ludwig and Elisabeth Banks play their roles just as one imagines them in the book.
positive;Whether young or old, whether comedy or musical fan, this movie has liked everyone I know.
positive;that doesn't fit, because he was so slimy to him now after the heroat bobs.
positive;I've rarely seen a body with so much radiance.
positive;A masterpiece!!
positive;"I'm already looking forward to ""Alice in Wunderlund""."
negative;He doesn't have enough blood and is too little horror I leveled him into the action film.
negative;"[... ""The Invitation"" gives away most of its potential."
positive;"""Moonraker"" is definitely the most uplifting bond."
negative;The story tries to be particularly clever and surprising in the end, but the end is simply forced and... stupid.
positive;"Thus, it is not quite inconceivable that Whedon is accused of his for the time being last work ""Age of Ultron"" family values."
positive;Not much.
negative;The dress is ok, the actors also go clear and should there be today's children looking at these movies and having fun it has my blessing.
negative;So instead of reopening the Second World War (this is important, yes, but there are just so many films about it), the story is used to be a memorial to modern society and thus gets a much more explosive and up-to-date reference!
positive;Also the soundtrack knows to convince.
positive;A good start is the beginning of the story, where you can remember your own childhood, and how terribly boring it is in a new, dreary environment without friends and toys, with parents who are always at work.
positive;He needs help, but at the wheel is the wrong woman, and she has the wrong friend.
positive;That makes him unique.
negative;The whole thing is underscored by a quite successful, though not infrequently somewhat kitschy soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat.
positive;Funny and sad at the same time.
positive;Then I took a look in his review archive and see there Fantastic Four (the first movie) with 3.5 stars !...Wow.
negative;Well, as an old movie freak, I'd also like to give my mustard to this movie.
positive;She makes mistakes, admits mistakes and doubts about herself.
positive;A film that undoubtedly moves!
positive;When I saw and noticed in the sneak preview it is split I thought it first meal oh god, because I am not a fan of such movies at all.
positive;Pierce Brosnan convinced me, too.
positive;But if you're into action, you shouldn't look at this movie, you should look at it.
negative;I watched this movie (District 9 /in the English version) in Melbourne.
negative;I've seen much worse movies, but the movie just misses a three-point rating.
positive;The film has a good complicated story and huge pictures instead of level-less ballers a la Avengers!
negative;5/10
negative;I was simply incorrigible - and is a wonderful film, which in his time presented a great Pixar object and in front of creativeness almost overwhelmingly.
negative;It is self-evident that it is with him a great-delusional law.
negative;Nevertheless, there would be potential for a 3.
positive;"To overcome a waiting time I looked at this ""children's film"" as an adult and I was very pleasantly surprised."
positive;The joke, the stiff David Niven (as opposed to the sporting, gallant real James Bond ala Connery) and the closing scene at Casino Royale is the smooth laugh par excellence !!
negative;But if the movie was once in a genre, it also implemented this well, only the constant offspring have somewhat annoyed.
positive;Who wants a blond 007 with sail ears?
negative;At no time has one the feeling to have to deal with more than one experimental arrangement.
positive;The second time I thought to myself: This is not about action and if there would be more action, the film seemed constructed and tailored to the same action.
positive;"But my sympathy is not only due to the sympathetic, large-scale hero who is going through a development, but first of all to the fact that ""Thor"" is rather a fantasy film with real-world elements."
positive;We can be proud of our country in these respects.
positive;And both can be glad that Hunt can keep his joy and Lauda his reason.
positive;some scenes are quite masterful.
positive;Since Batman's Dark Knight (last 20 min's) i didn't watch movies like your movie.
negative;"From then on, this horror strip is only a must-see of all those horror films that have already worked before him with the ""10 little Negerlein"" system."
positive;No one who has seen the Rambofilms and other machinations with Stallone in the last 30 years can have expected an intellectual highlight.
positive;Overall, a very successful film.
positive;Overall: a successful cinematic appeal to us all, finally to become active for Darfur.
positive;No teen movie, as I thought.
positive;I was very excited about the first part, but it was finally a movie with which you could really grumble.
negative;This is enriched with mentioned sexual subjects to the Sadomasochist, as well as a rugged mix of Haneke-DePalma-Cronenberg-Hitchcock bonds.
positive;----------------------------------------------------------------- The third chapter is called Â‘German night in Parisâ€ and makes a leap in time of three years.
positive;For me personally (!)
positive;After the talkative trailer I was pleasantly surprised to see an equally well made film.
negative;By the way, these were also all the main actors.
positive;â€œThe Green Mileâ€œ has the same prerequisites: the prison motif, again a template by Stephen King and again Darabont for the screenplay and the director â€œ and with Tom Hanks an excellent character actor in the leading role.Although the film comes from the pen of Stephen King, the whole is a slow, very quiet strip without explosions, bodies and only with very few horror effects (Coffey spits out a mouse swarm after every miracle act).
positive;The timing is perfect, the effects, especially the acoustic ones, are brilliantly placed.
negative;You shouldn't even try to break your head.
positive;We don't have any children, but he's probably something for the whole family.
negative;It deserves no detailed criticism.
positive;To put oneself in front of the sight with a good mood, and then to immerse itself in a very narrow history of the framework action, which, however, increasingly addresses the existential basic questions, naturally in their way.
negative;"This ""lincoln"" can offer quite simply a lack of entertainment."
positive;Rambo looks rather dangerous.
positive;The action that the (overdrawn) fight against the great Apollo Creed represents brings the film to a successful end.
positive;For me the best zombie movie and at the same time one of the best remakes of all time.
positive;----------------------------------------------------------------- Boxpromoter Turkish has a problem: just before a big fight organized by the gangster boss Brick Top, Turkish's partner Tommy can pull himself off and her fighter Gorgeous George is sent by the Gypsy One Punch Mickey in a baruckle fight on the boards.
positive;Basically, it is the case that the so-called â€œgoodâ€œ in the film do evils and the â€œgoodâ€TM.
negative;Horror is not wrong, that which I have seen (but) - especially the husk or its connected theory around the question what would come now after death - is ridiculously absurd nonsense.
positive;Kurzweile and tension supported by good acting performance let the spectator experience the oppressive tight of the phone booth.
negative;However, the accompanying midwife behind the border is taken into custody by the police while trying to distract her after Kee's water burst.
positive;But these do not matter so much.
positive;"Just like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" this is for me the perfect example for a perfect film."
positive;Three years ago in the cinema, he was great, but now I really understood him on TV.
negative;In the it seems often running, the process practically then with questionable points, important people and their concerns simply fall out of the film, and the personal attitudes of others change much too unmotivated.
positive;necessarily look at
positive;My personal Iron Man 3 experience was this year in spring and that although I hadn't seen the movie yet.
positive;In any case, a recommendation.
positive;It is reproduced in detail.
positive;Since it cannot be proved, it could also be true and thus meet each of us.
positive;A pagan fun 8/10
negative;The story has gone very wrong and most dialogues seem flat and without proper meaning.
positive;Who expects a highly complex action here is wrong.
negative;He just appeared, let his extremity play, and left again.
positive;If you have seen it in German, I would like to ask you again to look at it in English.
positive;"For once not with raised index finger, but as a ""tourist"" in the middle of it."
positive;The best movie ever made!
positive;"Pleasant as ""Syriana"" - which became too much for me with its widely branched four plotlines and the different time levels at some point - ""Michael Clayton"" does everything right - provided you are a lover of movies like ""The Insider"" or ""Good Night and Good Luck""."
positive;The Artist is not only a tribute to the silent film, but also a love explanation to the cinema!
positive;Because somewhere both grow to your heart.
positive;Wonderful TV movie!
positive;Spontaneously I have decided that this film now stands at No. 1 of my personal best list of the Star Skrek films.
positive;Nevertheless, his films have been rather solid to quite good in the last 10 years.
positive;I can only recommend, and is also better than gunfire movies like black hawk down, windtalkers, 1968 tunnel rat.
negative;Who stands on films from this time will be the drama thriller of the probably for Rowlands the most famous role that she ever had very much liked.
negative;In fact, this film is about 100 minutes of talking on average and yet you only remember the dying victims after that.
negative;Well, from a romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant, I would have expected a little more.
positive;Also, that the main character from 85 to about 10 years old always looks like a person - you can recognize Brad Pitt every time, be it under still so many age changes - inspires you simply.
negative;The film wants to polarize and get into conversation through such scenes, e.g.
positive;It has almost something old-fashioned, like Clooney and Co.
positive;Something like that is new and we hope that it will open the eyes of the Germans (Bürger like politicians) at the end!!
negative;"Every documentary on the topic ""Elser"" is 100x more interesting."
positive;Similarly, the evaluation of the word changing is the fact that the film focuses on architecture, landscapes and people in its nostalgia in an extremely aesthetic way.
negative;Strange, but the heroes always die with Him, only one not!
negative;A few on-liners are already there, about a very amusing elevator scene, but straight the adults among you will do themselves here with the laughing hard.
positive;but this is pure nothin' of fixed relationships.
positive;A grandiose performance.
positive;Beyond that, the duel of the two pilots was probably the best template for an exciting Formula 1 film.
negative;The actors play solid and want to get off with this story.
positive;The 3D underwater photos are great.
negative;Depending on the numerous logic errors, the characters are very woodcut and the actors are seen in part their pleasurelessness.
positive;And what's going on has not yet been seen.
negative;Nostalgia, how Stallone likes to spread them again and again and you automatically feel good as a fan.
negative;The film is designed for today's young people and makes within the scope of its one thing quite good: silly, funny, nonviolent and with nice actors.
positive;but also the sound is atmospheric and super fused with the pictures.
negative;Wow, who would have thought that?
negative;The film also draws heights and depths from beginning to end.
positive;In the end, the film shocks something, because you don't necessarily expect it to be... sending without end!
positive;When Cobb is hired by a Japanese businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), for a very special mission he sees the possibility of finally returning to his children to America, which he had to leave head over head when he was suddenly sought by the government due to special circumstances.
negative;What would have made me laugh, however, is the pseudo-constructed message, which just seems so terribly wrong in this movie, like a flying penguin, the worst of which is that it is pushed so unscathedly clearly on your nose, that it really gets the last arm lamp.
negative;"His ""smoothed"" facial skin makes his gestures and facial expressions sometimes seem grotesque, even ridiculous."
positive;For hours you can still discuss little things in the movie : eating, the other king, the fortress, the dog in the desert.
negative;"Conclusion: ""Carrie 2013"" doesn't do everything wrong and is quite enjoyable as an acceptable update thanks to two dedicated actresses, but should knower of the original at this point also be a warning."
positive;World War I.
positive;Finally a horror movie that stands out from the others!
positive;In the Castro district they open a photo shop, which quickly becomes the meeting point of the gay scene, for whose rights in the district and beyond Milk is increasingly active.
positive;The portrayal of Hashishin!
negative;"Ultimately, it is only the name Will Smith, who lures the visitors to the cinemas, where they use their smartphones to inform their ""fans"" at Snapchat about their visit to the cinema instead of following the thready story."
positive;I find the highest rating appropriate.
negative;Severance is completely irrelevant and without fresh ideas.
negative;"I think this movie was a movie too much in this ""Night in the Museum"" series."
positive;I've been thinking for a long time, but I can't think of a better movie than this one.
positive;I give the film 4 points.In my opinion he would have earned 5.
positive;In my opinion, one or the best film ever.
negative;Part 1 was awesome, part 2 was unfortunately already overwhelming but still acceptable, part 3 is degrading.
negative;"Just as he is a prime example of how talented characters can get a lot out of it, so he is unfortunately also a prime example of how a completely overlapping violence scene, which also makes up the end of ""Hannibal"", can destroy a film in the truest sense of the word, or the impression that you get from the film, can make."
positive;"By and large, one can say that ""Flight"" is a fascinating drama about the shattered and failed personality of the Williams ""Whip"" Whitaker."
positive;Shutter Island is a...
negative;"But a minimum of credibility and charisma with the ""bodies"" and also with the ""good ones"" would already be desirable."
positive;Personally, Inland Empire fascinates me very much.
positive;Of course, you have also given away a lot of potential straight Laurence Fishburne you would have been able to install quite a few game minutes longer and the end would also have been a bit longer and more detailed but I think with such a movie it is always very difficult not to make any mistakes.
positive;I find the wild horns totally cool, but nevertheless I find it a pity that this was the last part!!!!!!!
positive;I'll remember it for a long time and buy it on DVD.
positive;So come on down.
negative;Color game is super...Contents okay
positive;There are X moments where you just think what would you do in this situation?
positive;Without spoilers I can only say that the film is very, very perfect and has just as perfect cast and can keep up with at least all other parts!
positive;That he did a great job here, that with several good faces (Billy Cudrup, Lawrence Fishburne, Keri Russell, Ving Rhames) the supporting roles have been completed and that Phillip Seymour Hoffmann is currently presenting an Oscar as a Bösewicht (but rather pale which is not because of Hoffmann but because of the role) - all this doesn't really work out because it's a Tom Cruise movie.
positive;Dewie Cox plays his role excellently, he is the decisive factor that carries the film and makes it a must-see experience.
positive;have gone other ways.
positive;"Jason Behr (a.k.a. Eliot guest) plays the role of the helpless victim, who tries to use his intelligence at first and carefully diplomatically oppose his tormentors, later increasingly desperate also turns to ""his audience"" in order to finally completely resign."
negative;But in front of loud effects and animation tricks, the plot gets totally into the background.
positive;the story was partly very predictable, but still failed its own charm.
positive;In the movie there are many good dialogues and really great!!!
positive;And I love that.
positive;Upstairs I wrote the film would pull the floor away from you in a moral sense.
negative;The introduction of the gruesome nun, which is responsible for the undoubtedly best scenes in the film, is equally pleased.
positive;What Goyo can trigger here for emotional moments by very committed actors is strongly reminiscent of the best blockbuster times of the 80s and 90s.
positive;Hammer Action movie.
negative;The attempt of a large-scale story - completely gone into your pants because far too complex.
negative;I've also tasted it..........
negative;The strip is quite ok by hand, but does not convey any statement beyond simple entertainment - most of all about the futility of film business and life as such.
positive;"First of all to the ""Hater"" and ""Amerikahasser"" who rate the film so badly."
positive;This distinguishes him from several totally cheap stripes with stupid dialogues.
positive;But it is serious to the young ladies and the not much older poet.
positive;Matching to the parents a bit twisted by the style of clothing but cool.
positive;The film is full of emotions and feelings.
positive;Horny story looks really great.
positive;"In addition, ""The Book of Eli"", just in the second half, is very religious."
positive;His co-stars are also well laid out, above all a rough-legged but nevertheless good-mature Sean Bean, as well as Jessica Chastain, Michael PeÃ±a, Aksel Hennie, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan as astronaut colleagues.
positive;However, I would like to praise here still a scene - the Sternensänger-Scene.
positive;"Not without reason does Campino, as a photographer Finn, find out in one question: ""What do I lack?"" He lacks what he is looking for."
positive;Would otherwise be boring.
positive;And then I could finally see him.
positive;The driver is nameless in the movie, but that didn't stop him from being a cult figure between the creepy film figures already.
positive;What do we expect from the implementation of a comic book, which, in my opinion, has not been propped up with soooo imaginative dialogues.
negative;Only convince the pictures.
positive;And for all who have not read the book, a reason to buy it now as a pocket book.
positive;But by now I've seen him over 20 times and just find him horny.
positive;exciting and gripping until the end.
positive;A sensationally good film that captivates you from the first second ... and that with the simplest means ... like the chess game ... little gestures that suggest a lot ... Sandrine Bonnaire plays incredible, from her face you can read everything, for this role she would have earned every film prize.
positive;Very well entertaining.
positive;the last part of the nolan batman trilogy sees the light of the world.
positive;Granted, one must want to see these in order to recognize them.
positive;8/10
positive;"what I also liked about the movie \""Like\"" now nit knows how to write it better.. that he doesn't have a happy end!"
positive;Thank you very much!
negative;A distasteful film, which does not convince, does not accomodate and at the end due to the unending (loving?)
positive;I have to say: The film remains very good, but there was one thing that really gave me very negative.
negative;Positive is certainly to note that Zach Galifianakis as Allen is just absolutely super.
positive;I just can't get enough of this movie, and I can watch it over and over again, and it overwhelms me every time again.
positive;Pan's maze is one of them.
positive;It's worth seeing.
positive;Cara Delevingne has the role of antagonist with Enchantress, but is quite fine in her role but in my opinion somewhat misplaced.
negative;Neither the well-known actors nor the excellent equipment could pass over the medium script.
positive;A little bit slow and a sympathetic hero.
positive;The film had 4.8 million viewers in the ARD.
positive;All in all: What should you wish for more?
negative;How cruel.
positive;"The topic of the film is quite up-to-date and the message I understood so that neither Michael nor Bruno leased the ""right way of dealing"" with the stimulus topic sex for themselves."
negative;Well, it's not that movie.
positive;In addition to Oliver Wood and Rodrigo Prieto, hardly anyone masteres the art of creating dynamics so well without it degenerates in hustle and bustle.
positive;Superman is ode because he can do anything and can only be attacked by this lame kryptonite.
negative;Before that, however, thereâ€TMs gives an exhausting and almost quaint story at the Chucky in a house with a warmly unsympathetic family creeping around and the figures gradually reduced.
positive;I cried with laughter.
positive;Harrison Ford blooms up almost more than in Star Wars 7, Jared Leto is so eerie (and visually incredibly cool) that the skin of the garden grew stronger and Ana de Armas, as well as Sylvia Hoeks or a great Dave Bautista convinced me completely, just like the Swiss Carla Juri.
positive;Action scenes=Super With a lot of heart and brain.
positive;(I only realised at the end that the story was autobiographical Still no rental has found itself, but I very much hope that this will succeed.
positive;The dialogues are perfectly worked out, the music fits absolutely brilliantly and already the story is a smooth success Must have seen!
positive;Easy to use!!!
positive;You take away the inner tornness of your character without a wink, you can also guess by his gestures and facial expressions what he must have gone through himself.
positive;Very well recommended!
negative;2.In an unwinnable war, people die for a country that treats them like scum.
positive;"He urgently needs money to save the casino ""Rabbits Foot"" inherited from his grandfather Lucky from ruin, because the real estate shark Steve Lavisch is after the store."
positive;The first part is definitely the most thirsty.
positive;I would also like to be so careful that in such a situation I can take 7 minutes to think.
positive;The film impressively shows the feeling world of the three referendars with all the heights and depths again and also manages to reflect and criticize the state school system.
positive;If I could, I would congratulate the actors all on this successful movie...
positive;The film is a mixture of high voltage thriller and A beautiful Mind.
positive;"Or also in the age of Facebook and Youtube again rise to the ""leader""?"
positive;Also our German actors (Berkel/Kretschmann/Möhring) set short and precise accents.
positive;He plays his role great and I liked it very much.
positive;this conflict occurs again and again in the film, without all too much attention.
positive;In order to beat Bane and stop his destructive mission, Bruce must grow beyond himself.
negative;Look at the original.
positive;"After much distortion, producer Andrew Hauptman acquired the remake rights already in 2004 from the author Paul Abbott, who with „€žMord on page 1"" (title of the German TV broadcast) had landed a full hit and possibly did not hold anything from a sale of his material."
positive;Here, too, attention was paid to tapping contacts to Django from 1966, so the same song is played.
negative;Especially since he was probably not a saint in this regard.
positive;You feel sooo with the little one.
positive;The way the women were treated in the institution and were there deserves my respect.
negative;The film has structure, comes classically with a few actors, music and set fits.
positive;An aging painter has not painted for ten years, his muse (and wife) no longer inspires him, the masterpiece that has begun remains unfinished.
positive;Classic Rodriquez!
negative;"It is again a very nice ""ammi-filming"", which unfortunately missed the actual philosophical background."
positive;Panzer) There is no suspension of the performances of the actors.
positive;Especially the main person is an impressive actor.
positive;With these beautiful and real pictures director McCarthy makes a lot right.
positive;I, too, am a big fan of â€œNightmare Before Christmasâ€ , which can be used as a comparison, since it resembles â€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€
positive;Rarely from the very beginning, I was tossed so persistently at first sight.
positive;There's only half a star trigger for tiny inconsistencies.
positive;"Paul Greengrass remains true to his style from the ""Bourne Verschwörung""."
positive;"IV: \"" Once the Jedi were the centers of the galaxy before it became dark in the world.\"" and dark it was really."
positive;This may also be due to the fact that there are too many characters in this movie.
positive;In the beginning the story is quite ok, also understandable somewhere.
positive;Very nice to see how everything is sharpened and how the bow is beaten to the fourth part.
positive;Especially in a counter-overlay of the bell tower scene from Fitzcaraldo - once played by the duo Robarts/Jagger and once by Kinski, show the genius of the century talent Kinski.
positive;Steve Buscemi also plays a very good role.
negative;The two incoming bounty groups have similar distinctive leaders: there is Santana (solide: Jordi MollÃ¡), who with his latino-like name and appearance makes the temperamentally unbalanced.
positive;I've seen so many movies with Bruce Willis that I can't imagine him without that voice.
negative;Up to the point with the recording of surveillance video, from then on everything suddenly makes no sense anymore, everything that happened before and after.
negative;tja, it remains a faded aftertaste, that once again too much LÃ¤rm (au on the part of criticism) was made.
positive;The film changes from past in the future and the change is done very well for that the film is so old.
positive;The movie changes fabulously between dramatic and amusing scenes.
positive;"""Inception"" is definitely not a mainstream movie from Hollywood, for that the movie is far too complex and profound."
positive;It's about aliens who land on Earth and whose intention humanity is trying to find out.
positive;A clear recommendation!
negative;In the end, this mixture also goes beyond the lack of substance in both stages of action: the chemistry between the shady buffoon and the drunken tourist is already doomed to failure on paper and a rather hair-sharp idea.
positive;Dialog joke, situation comedy, rugged types were present.
negative;"Correlation of the whole, his master bullshit: ""Even good marriages must live through terrible years""."
positive;The emotions increase to a maximum.
positive;Without pathos, without kitsch, with quirky additions (a duck walks excitedly and lost beautiful on the platform of the drilling island around, surrounded by the impressively roaring sea from the canvas - a lost homopÃ¤rchen enjoys the seclusion of the drilling island and makes dance performances - a sensual cook searches for every dish the moody music- Hannah sits like the cook on a children's swing and they swing past each other ) and especially with wonderful music inlays, which counters the sad depths of human indulgences the beautiful lightness of the musically transported joie de vivre...
positive;Strange.
negative;Marketing strategy number two would then be Everybody's Darling Jennifer Lawrence, which is similar to the film poster, brought into the center.
positive;It becomes particularly clear that also back-ups are to be accepted and people who are dear to one must be left in the desert.
positive;The script is masterly and the music fits perfectly.
negative;This trilogy serves as a small appetizer before you look at the real Star Wars series.
positive;All I have to do is agree with the FSK.
positive;The less affected environment does not make it easy for the all too obvious victim to move out of the victim's role into society.
negative;Then five robots.
positive;It reminded me very much of his performance in True Detective and only for that reason already worth seeing for fans of it.
negative;For non-smokers, the film is a torture.
positive;Event Horizon is absolutely successful.
negative;But it is much worse that the film could not let me immerse myself in his plot or feel sympathy for a character or curiosity about the story.
positive;"Because I think the movie ""does"" out of the cinema."
negative;"And in order to put a little gaze on it, one lets the ""hero"" ride on the battlefield of all cowboy-manier gen horizont (sch)reiten!"
positive;Only the role of Amanda is a bit...well illogical but what should...everything in everything a very good movie!!
positive;The effects generated on the computer unfortunately stand out clearly in some scenes and cannot be hidden even by clever cuts.
positive;Conclusion:Very successful film.The tension curve is gradually getting higher, but suddenly stops at the far too short finale.Nevertheless, I find the film good and very subservient.
positive;Back to the actual: In action and tension the film is almost not to be surpassed.
positive;This lies on the one hand at the atmosphere and on the other at the wonderful backdrop.
positive;Even if ARD documentary films (also by Stefan Aust) offer more background information, this film provides an entertaining event thanks to the well-played roles.
positive;Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, the two authors of this film, like to tell the following story about their film: The two were present at a performance of â€œThe first contactâ€ in order to experience the reaction of the audience up close.
positive;SAUBER DANIEL AND YOUR TEAM CONTINUES THEN!
positive;The viewer is also given a lot of space to think.
positive;Although I admit that I am a big Saw fan, The Ring was definitely a pleasant variety and has prepared me almost more cheese skin than the last SAW part.
negative;But apart from her disneyesque singing, Vaiana is a very sympathetic heroine, whom I immediately put into my heart with her attachment and courage.
positive;apart from gollum, but this is due to the present, the struggle between smeagol and gollum, because here the soul life is actually pronounced.
positive;Although the film itself is rather a B movie, it has some psychological depth to offer, which also determines the uncompromising, ingenious end.
negative;:-( One point of special effects and one of the flying monkeys because of... that's all I can give.
positive;A really horny movie... only with a bit of an absluss gig at the end...
positive;Sad, touching, stimulating to think.
positive;I NEVER heard anything about the novel before and can't say if it was well adapted.
negative;The creatures are always only to be seen fighting in the beginning and before you can get involved in the situation, you jump to the next.
positive;All actors performed very satisfactorily.
positive;Well I found this Potter really very well succeeded I have not (yet) read The book itself, but: It is quite clear, at least it should be quite clear to everyone that a film can never reach a book!
positive;Why not five stars?
positive;And is he perhaps on the soundtrack???
positive;This zombie horror really makes fun!
negative;The actors are okay, though not unusual.
positive;He does not create or romanticize any side, he captivates with wonderful recordings and does not shy away from drastic scenes.
negative;The film simply offers nothing special and is just boring in the end.
positive;Oh, and they danced too!
negative;To the story...
positive;==References====External links==
negative;As I said, the story sounds exciting but the execution?...
positive;What I liked so much about the movie is that I really did it, that didn't happen to me in a horror movie any longer.
positive;Through the observation, one comes to a serial murder on the heels.
negative;The plot is like chewing gum and you can hardly talk about humor!
positive;Remarkable that there is still movie(s?)
positive;On the other hand, Blanche is the usual lady of the time.
positive;And the action is pretty much the best thing there's ever been.
positive;Ok the movie can't keep up with the action of King Kong, Narnia or the Army of the Rings but it's still so beautiful and the actors fit the movie properly.
positive;The slow pace is OK at first, but in the second half it gets a little too slow, especially the end.
positive;I find my ideas, which I imagined, when I read the books, are far surpassed.
positive;a small negative point is that the action should be a little more heavy!
positive;Rightly, she wears the red jacket and white sweaters in the scene at the mailbox in front of the house by the lake (Valentin's Day 2008).
positive;Unfortunately, the search for the soldier James Ryan drags itself a little long and also make dialogues are quite close.
negative;In addition, the stripe has been available from back to back and does not really offer anything new.
positive;Hi hilary duff and olive james are my favorite stars and that you have made a movie together that is also full of romantic and very cool I find the super
negative;"It looks like you need to be ""fan"" of Final Fantasy to understand what's going on in this world."
positive;I would decide for Oldboy if I were to stand between the two before the election.
positive;while the spectator is fevering towards the end, bond and his companions prepare themselves for the last fight.
positive;Every gag is sitting, the running gags are extremely funny and the dynamics between the two main actors is just huge cinema.
positive;I was in the sneak preview and of course I didn't know what to expect.
positive;Perfect popcorn cinema is offered here.
positive;Hammer Story, great acting performance, especially by Rosamunda Pike.
positive;Why negative criticism simply does not experience any evocative relevance, is easily explained.
positive;A clear recommendation both for school classes and for thriller fans!
negative;"From a moral point of view, the film cannot be regarded as successful: to use a ""14-year-old child"" as a decoy for its own criminal activities."
positive;The end, one of the saddest I've ever seen...
positive;At the beginning you really sit there and think: Helpe.. when she goes into the Moulin Rouge everything becomes very fast and colorful.. but so is the movie and you have quickly wanted to.. Already alone like Ewan McGregor talks about love.. oh beautiful...
positive;After all the information I was at first quite skeptical whether the whole effort is worth for such a survival fight.
positive;"Since this positive conclusion is only scratching at the surface of ""Oblivion"", I am all the more surprised about the comparatively poor evaluation against material battles that are more suitable for mainstream use such as ""Ironman 3"" or ""Star Trek: Into Darkness""..in which only the form packed in sensationally passing picture cascades is paid homage, behind which however any content/deep movement has to step back."
positive;And he dares to be thrillingly short with just 75 minutes of length and not to keep unnecessarily â€ ¬Füllerâ€œ.
negative;Only the ears as chosen scene stands out and can partly influence the atmosphere of the film positively.
positive;Conclusion: Stunning scenario.
positive;Here, as hardly in any other film, it becomes clear what humanity is still able to do to or expect to do to others to this day and today.
positive;Conclusion: Very engaging image of a suffering young woman and a denied love - painful and sad!
positive;I thought the movie was great!
negative;There he meets Emil Rottmayer (Arnold SChwarzenegger) and so they form a plan.
positive;For an exciting and exciting film evening, the film is only highly recommended!
negative;For thank God what happens and the Chinese come , and are evil to the poor Tibetans ( Sarcasm is inappropriate on such serious issues).
negative;"My favorite criticism on IMDB sums it up very well in one paragraph: ""Darth Vader, err, Darth Maul - umm, I mean Nero - has this huge, gigantic awesome Death Star - err, I mean Mining Ship, that can destroy enter planets."
positive;TOP!
negative;The catch on the whole thing is that the movie takes way too long to really get to the point.
positive;Why this film is so important to me, I can not really describe clearly, But it tells the story of a boy who discovers the time travel.....By the way, the whole whole whole healing world of the suburbs is deconstructed and the moral concepts of the Americans are questioned..In addition, the omnipresent question: What is normal???
positive;The sympathy of the Ellis is sometimes already scary, because it may shock or move nothing longer.
positive;I'm sure you're looking!
positive;This doesn't sound as intense as in the road battle of Winter Soldier or the tunnel chase in Civil War, but the action is more massive and less uplifted than in some other MCU film.
positive;However, the resources of his planet are exhausted and he is about to perish.
positive;FAZIT: Absolutely worth seeing!!!
positive;I have seen today the German version in 3 D and will grant me in two weeks the English version.
positive;There is a detailed review on the FILMCHECKER Blog!
positive;But they won't forget the movie that they saw him so soon.
positive;No character development to see: No, not at all.
negative;About the ghosts.
negative;When I started to watch the film, I thought that I had to deal with one of these teen high school movies again, whose story you already know too well.But what followed was really surprising, both positive and negative.On the one hand, I thought it was good that the story was shown without any risk of any loss, on the other hand, I found that Tracy's change was just a surprise.This whole story with the credit card didn't really make much sense to me.In addition, I found something of the evie's character, which has already been very manipulative for its thirteen years.
positive;"""The Valley of the Worlds ""Iraq"" perhaps does not contribute to the cultural dialogue, but it also shows the actual conditions in Iraq, the human-inhumane conditions."
positive;And how you spent it.
positive;With clear pictures, which should actually stop everyone from ever toasting this damn stuff, also hopefully all of them will be prevented from doing so.
positive;In my opinion, the preview did not hold the 100%, but I would say that 95% has already held it.
negative;2omin are still quite ok, but afterwards everything becomes very predictable and superficial!
negative;This film is simply predictable, has no poets and is grotesque played badly by the main actors.
negative;The reviews ranged from flop to epic, I wanted to enjoy this movie completely unbiased.
positive;I'm sure that's also due to the budget, because the way I read it, the movie cost only $200,000.
negative;This short detour should probably show that the drug war is complex and on the other hand people are also standing.
positive;Here he plays the hijacker Ray Marcus and steals the show for everyone.
positive;However, David Fincher finally manages to stage a great strip due to the strong script, which never gets boring at a minute.
positive;They want to be coveted and promoted and not just: do you want to go with me?
positive;The black humor and that is quite good, in my opinion.
positive;So I found the movie really heartbreaking.Z
positive;The other actors of the film are only supporting roles, they convince however nevertheless all.
positive;As I said, the sets were fantastic, Ghostland had a wonderful sense of terrible images captured by a wonderful camera.
negative;The only actor I bought the show was Joel Basman as Tommy.
positive;Our actions have consequences, sometimes good, sometimes bad.
positive;Only yesterday I watched the film in the cinema.Whoever goes to the cinema with the expectation of a typical American staged thriller, will have a problem with the film.It is just a German film and in my opinion a good one.
positive;Do not regret having looked at him and wait eagerly for the 2nd.
positive;So many great funny moments.
negative;"Apart from the absurdity as such Then still these sins of the 90s (if I see these frontal car driving shots from the studios I get cases); a, as already mentioned in the film start review, quite weak Nick Nolte."
negative;He's not really going through a development either.
negative;The film is said to be an anthem to democracy, but criticizes everything that constitutes a democracy.
positive;This movie is the best movie I've ever seen.
positive;"And so it is one of the greatest achievements in Spielberg's career that he is not as complex as with the gruesome ""baader meinhof"", which did the terrorist simply condemned, but is interested in their motivation and let both sides enter into a metaphorical dialogue."
positive;It is not a simple science fiction film with the eternally well-known elements, but it waits with nevertheless surprising but for me as happy-end-lovers not exactly beautiful turns.
positive;I find the expressionless facial expression of Nick Cage just hammer, actually that's why it's worth seeing.
positive;Result: Tastes are different and that's also good.
positive;"Nevertheless, the film captivates over long distances, which is also due to the acting of H.Ford and T.L.Jones (but whose Oscar award - especially in comparison with the then nominated L.DiCaprio and R.Fiennes - is not necessarily fair; a nomination would have sufficed assu...)."
positive;In my opinion, a cinematic masterpiece, and a very clear recommendation to see the film in 3D in the cinema.
positive;But Casino Royal I find a very good movie definable Bond is no longer the SUPER AGENT.
positive;The characters are to cuddle and the film has just heart!
negative;So if you have sorted the actions for yourself, then a lot of banalities and absurdities are revealed.
positive;So I also start with my big criticism of Cameron's Sci-Fi Actioner!
positive;But first of all: It is about Johnny, who is sheep-daughter and, in order not to do his work alone, support of the Romanian guest worker Gheorghe, who gradually fall in love with each other.
negative;While Alexandra Maria Lara's appearance in the role of the witness of the indictment detained in the concentration camp can be regarded as Cameon, Brune Ganz (,,,Der UntergangÃ¢ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ ́ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ
negative;even if the acting performance is ok, an all in all weak movie.
positive;Although topics such as loneliness (as in LiT), meaning of life (as in LiT) are addressed, they are not as good and profound as in LiT.
positive;So, best conversation.
positive;in each of these scenes, a mixture of wit, pointed mono- and dialogues and a great sense of delusion emerges.
positive;Chalie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, and many more.
positive;But I was relatively positively surprised by an action movie, which is relatively fast, impulsive and exciting.
positive;Introducing the licenses make the film a little more beautiful to watch, shame that the 2nd and 3rd.
positive;The young people could be even better with the Lindsay Lohan version â€œHerbie Fully Loadedâ€œ from 2005 â€œ but for someone like me who has seen the old movies uncountable times uaf ARD it is nice to do it again on DVD with optimized image.
negative;In itself, I always find films of this kind very good.
positive;Saw is one of the few horror movies that has a really good and intelligent plot.
positive;In the film, the war takes place in 2017 if I have this in my memory - in reality it is supposed to take place around 2024 (according to Pentagon documents) when the Chinese have finished their aircraft carriers with atomic bribery with a possible first strike of North Korea â€TM Dokutip â€TM€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€
positive;Recommended!
positive;Good actors.
positive;I have rarely seen such a bad trailer for a then quite good movie.
negative;The critique of film starts is not a critique, but only a subjective leftist anti-Bush slogan driven by the film that proves all forms of stupidity and manipulation that this film expresses.
negative;All right, let's not overdo it.
positive;Already the film title was chosen very cleverly, he stands nevertheless for the time at which he clings to Summer.
positive;But now to the film: I find David Yates has learned his mistake from the fifth part and made the film so that he does not get too hectic and yet he has brought in everything important.
positive;So many people are concerned about every little thing.
positive;"Great scenes depict the emotional sensitivities visually and make them tangible (e.g. Spoiler: when Lars emerges from the bathtub, the aunt suddenly sits on the edge of the tub and searches for the conversation with him... she doesn't want to give him the impression of being an ""intruder"" ...) and also very fine and amusing representation of interpersonal interaction with trickery, paraphernalia (keyword: Christmas dinner!!)"
negative;Would not be bad, if not many recordings would become so dark!
negative;The production, however, prevents the film from degrading to total catastrophe.
positive;We, who live in a completely globalized world, have still not managed to develop a universal language.
positive;With this film new fans were won, the production costs recorded and the optimal starting position for a second film created.
negative;The question of how to give real superheroes in real life would be really exciting.
positive;"But above all, kate winslet surprised me, so far as I was an actor - one could forgive me - only found so medium - apart from the ""reader""."
positive;If you don't find a shocker like this hard, you should go to the psychiatrist.
positive;"Overall Tropic Thunder comes very fresh and funny, but somehow the ""kick"" is missing to play with the elite, a successful, good and funny movie."
positive;Otherwise you can say nothing more about Akira than that it is an unforgettable, in all filmic concerns grandiose masterpiece.
positive;The trigger is a dusty treasure box that Amelie accidentally finds behind a tile of her apartment.
negative;Part so soothingly removed from the usual uniform porridge!
positive;A beautiful entertaining movie one whose story you know, but not made in this way,cool.
positive;but the worst for it is obvious that he feels strong with his measly self-consciousness only if he can degrade it.
positive;In the first hour there are also a few scenes that seem a little work of art, e.g. by sudden atmospheric turns, but that is only next to thing, and does not change the overall impression otherwise.
positive;Policeman Asger (Jakob Cedergren) later in the evening gets the telephone emergency call of a kidnapped woman (Jessica Dinnage).
positive;He gives the whole thing a rough, kernely charm and just plays great and totally likeable.
positive;the best and most impressive is, however, the conclusion, ***SPOILER*** as andrew/teddy sees his fault and yet decides for a life as a 'monster' to escape his memories is the strongest scene of the film.
positive;The story is simple and yet full of so many emotions.
positive;You take away the tough guy who's only pursuing a simple goal.
positive;It's a nice movie.
positive;In addition, the atmospheres were always very appropriate and the interaction of the actors came honest and genuine.
negative;At least the movie made me laugh.
positive;That such a genieler film not everyone felt is almost already clear.
positive;Already that alone is something I really want to emphasize again.
positive;Every movie fan should have seen it.
positive;Daniel Craig is excellent.
positive;"Against the background I can only protect the head, if here people express your opinion, who have already seen ""many Krasseres"" or which the film simply bores."
positive;"^^ However, Landa, in spite of/because of his diabolically eloquent presence, is the absolute audience favorite, whereas the Basterds, due to some of their morally questionable actions, should give the audience a boost - with this, Tarantino turns the classic image of the ""radical hero"" with which the audience identifies itself and the ""dark villain"", and thus provides a controversial view of the actual pro- or antagonists."
positive;Wuff
positive;The trailer had convinced me to watch it in the cinema.
positive;There they are, the bunch of assholes Marvel promised us.
negative;The whole idea of this movie is so bad.A very bad movie, point end out!
positive;The movie is actually much more, which one cannot express in words.
positive;It's awesome in 3D!
positive;Who in the world still wonders why birth rates in Germany today are lower than in the final phase of the 2nd century?
positive;In our imagination we are Jeff, it is we who lie half naked and tied on a table and are looking for a way out of this seemingly hopeless situation.
positive;Halloween - The Night of Grey is a timeless classic that provides for masterful entertainment with every sighting.
negative;Since the film is based on a true event, it must have been that way.I can only protect my head and such scenes are too high.
positive;Eight points for me.
negative;The experiences in the animus were for me the reason why I watched the film end because those were the strong scenes of the film.
positive;"The rest of the cast was also solid, whereby I would like to highlight Ana de Armas as ""Joi""."
negative;I only know two things that are so hot, an ice cream and a car model.
positive;"Very entertaining, actually family-friendly (well, I had to laugh dirty when the shield card philosophizes about the magical forces of his ""tail"";-) film, in which you are always animated to laugh at least once."
positive;The content is banal, so the archetype is all the more refined.
negative;If the fictitious parquet and these Japanese, for example, would have orcs, because of me also Höllenorks, one could have the much more relaxed nodding, yes enjoying or having fun, but so remains the taste-degrading ideology in the back of mind, which stands behind all this.
positive;You must have seen this film trilogy (at least 1 time) (more often, however, does not harm at all)!
positive;But I see the films as a great whole and stick to my evaluation of 4 stars, so one under Lord of the Rings.
positive;first only the goal of the award ceremony with itself.
positive;That was especially nice and this scene, the movie and of course the great performance of Sean Penn remain firmly stored in my back of mind and I will gladly remember this movie back.
negative;And Jonah Hill in particular is hiding an unruly left unsympath of whom hopefully an image of the dear fat buddy does not harm.
positive;In any case, you can quickly see if the film feels like it or not, so you lose only a little time.
positive;This film is simply an absolute highlight.
positive;After both of them have come home for a long time, Bambi gets the order from his father to train Trinity as a horse thief.
positive;The movie wouldn't have worked like this in Barcelona, for example.
positive;Not the typical little comedy that you expect under it - but nevertheless a movie with a lot of heart and a lot of fun.
positive;And yet, during the film, one notices that both women have a particular feature: they both feel this mother instinct, which is simply evolutionary and which slumbers deep inside each woman.
negative;This movie is just an insult!
positive;Recommended for open-minded cineasts.
positive;I don't like to imagine what would happen if 70 bombs explode daily on American soil, people are shot in churches, American soldiers are abused in prisons, and their women are raped in front of you.
negative;Kickass 2 by Jeff Wadlow offers a sovereign continuation of the first part and seems constantly anxious to meet fans of the crazy first part.
positive;A further mystery of film history, at least for not Isider.
negative;For 2 hours in a laundry dryer glotzen is much more exciting!
positive;The actors are also very well chosen... it was a pleasure to see the movie =) And he is very romantic as well.
positive;You can look at it!
