negative;unfortunately not quite.

positive;A masked killer has captured the family, only the little daughter seems to be still hidden somewhere and so Arkin decides to help her.

positive;First and foremost, however, is Omar Sharif, whom I consider one of the best actors of his time.

positive;Back to the weeds.

negative;The fact that the film also rightly did not get a Goldjung is largely due to the, in my opinion, for whatever reason, the Oscar nominated screenplay.

positive;However, the aliens themselves are not mentioned in the film.

positive;"""Man of Steel"" is a pure action spectacle."

positive;"As for Thomas Newman's score, in ""Skyfall"" he rather returns to the roots of 007 and thus puts us in the classic Bond feeling."

positive;The first 2\3thirds of the film are absolutely world class, creating an absolutely riveting tension.

positive;This is because the film is based on true events.

positive;just perfect i find the film totally good!!!

positive;"To bring his son ""home"" Thomas sets off for France."

negative;Hi, we also watched the movie because it was hugely hyped.

negative;Bibi bravely steps in as a substitute, scores a few points and - of course - gets in trouble, because a girl can surely only score points when she's been hexed.

positive;In general, the entire film is full of bombastic action and breathtaking special effects that really doesn't have to hide from the competition.

positive;In combination with the recorded commentaries of various radio and television commentators, this creates a real racing feeling for the viewer, even if these scenes occasionally seem a little confusing.

negative;And the story was also more than laughable.

positive;The stage light from the ice rink was directed to the aisle running toward them, where Nancy Kerrigan was weeping bitterly.

positive;The review is very appropriate (even if it spoils a lot!

positive;I was incredibly impressed by that.

positive;The only thing that was missing is Q who wants to put humanity on trial again:-) This movie is the proof that Star Trek is better than Star Wars!

positive;Therefore, there was plenty of scope for action, and a Robert Downey Jr.

negative;Sigourney Weaver plays her character super as usual, but unfortunately this has hardly anything to do with the replay that you could only admire after the 3 first parts.

positive;An absolute firework display of special effects.

positive;Of course, an absolutely predictable love story should not be missing.

negative;Furthermore, the ending disappoints all along the line: everything suddenly takes a good end - of course completely surprising - which no one could have guessed...

positive;Perfectly flimsy and staged re-launch of the series, in which the humor is not missing in just the right dose - we can look forward to more!

positive;Music only appears when someone turns on the radio or record player in the film.

positive;All in all, a very good comedy that you should definitely check out.

negative;Nevertheless, if two more films are shot, that will not be enough.

negative;To express it in school grades: It's as if you first wrote a 2, then a 4 and last but not least a 6!

positive;but who fan and as a small child could already inspire for the two monkeys^^ will be fully satisfied!

negative;The film is by no means weak, but it's not more than average either.

positive;Nevertheless, I had to grin almost continuously at this ingenuity, especially Charly captivated me.

positive;There was also more in the 1st quarter.

positive;But this subject matter made sense in the Bond films' efforts to offer something as contemporary as possible.

positive;The vocal performances are excellent, captivating with a rousing production.

positive;Even though Praunheim is present here as the protagonist, as in many of his other films, this becomes visibly secondary as the film progresses.

positive;The absolute highlight is of course the final showdown against the devil himself.

positive;Both films have their raison d'Ãªtre, as the opening of the story conveys a completely different feeling.

negative;"Only a few ""highlights"" (I can only call these due to the fact that the rest of the movie is just bland) like Marcellus' saying (""I'll work you with a blowtorch"") or Butches' saying (""I'm American, there names have no deeper meaning"") save the movie from being a total crash for me personally."

positive;The gloomy atmosphere in addition and especially the absolutely terrific performance of the two young actors.

positive;Damn ignoramuses!

positive;unbelievers have no knowledge of the bible.

negative;Unfortunately spielts the no longer in the cinema, but that has really absolutely class!

negative;the end also very good!

negative;2.

positive;Sure, it's not for everyone, but if you're into movies like The Wedding Crashers or the classic Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, this film will surely make you doubled over in laughter.

negative;Even I, as a woman, have to admit that the men in the film are kept very small.

positive;for example, snape's memories or harry and dumbledore in the anteroom to the otherworld... the film took its time for that, and that was a very big plus!

negative;I mean Seymour didn't even get the chance to show his skills.

negative;"""Sensitive Chris would break up over the breakup - yet he can't help but continue working for McCauley and indulging in gambling addiction."""

negative;Film-noirish to Hitchcock-like, worth a look, even if not one of the really big bringers from its time.

positive;would be seeehhhrrrr net.

positive;Likewise, they were not so convinced by the still unknown Al Pacino.

positive;The film is shot at a remarkable pace.

negative;Even though the acting was solid in parts, it didn't save the film.

negative;The idea is also very good.

negative;The hint at the end, what could have happened to Jimmy, then throws any message, which was propagated the whole film long before long, over the heap again.

negative;All in all, a tame, boring film (and we weren't expecting an action tearjerker or anything).

negative;In my opinion, partly yes, but there is still room for improvement.

positive;But with Harry, I'm disappointed.

negative;In my opinion the worst work of tim Burton.

negative;the movie is soooo bad.

positive;Great cinema what awaits you here!

positive;Thanks Peter!

positive;Fans should not miss the editiere Ulysses Cut.

positive;At the same time, Burton pays tribute to old-fashioned horror films in his own way, bringing gothic, loud and bloody horror to the screen, especially in the opening scene as well as the apocalyptic showdown.

positive;To @Andreas now now calm down again, ok?!

negative;5.

negative;"Also, it doesn't seem as overloaded goofy and cheap as ""Batman V Superman""."

positive;After Jurassic World, I'm now trying my hand as a film critic again.

positive;Thus, the father figure is likely to be much more than an extra-idian in disguise - namely, the incarnation of a being who has access to all thoughts and ideas that have ever existed in the universe (or, even more metaphysically, a being who embodies all these thoughts and ideas as a kind of world spirit).

positive;Again and again, clues appear that he is not able to interpret.

negative;"Both together don't work and the result is a bumpy script disaster like in the last ""007 adaptations""."

positive;This is basically quite simple (at least nothing really new), but told in a time-shifted and somewhat chaotic way, so that the viewer is kept spellbound.

positive;this movie is just great it is the first in the series that is always dark and doesn't try to make everything as kid friendly as possible which is why it is one of the best in the series

positive;I think this film is brilliant because it expresses many things that everyone has in them, it is very much based on the manga and anime, which is rare in film adaptations of this kind.

positive;I also love problem films, film noir and the like, but: this is loose, breezy, casual.

positive;one of takashi miike's best films not a pure action film but rather an action drama conclusion: a film worth seeing that hollywood could never make

negative;The film starts very quietly, but then increases until it loses tension again after a while.

negative;I'll stick with the books.

positive;Leave this movie where it is!

positive;And the New Die Hard is the best action movie I've seen in recent years.

positive;Top!

negative;But this is not a big negative point.

negative;"The dramatic gestures and closing rhetoric of the teacher near the end do not fit the much too short and much too ""simple"" development."

positive;There is not too much action but not too little either, all very well balanced.

negative;Secondary.

negative;Temporary impotence in superheroes is also addressed, here we are shown that the man is deeply controlled by his vulnerable psyche and may need a latex costume with action foreplay to harden his masculinity.

negative;"So that one then also gets to hear such completely enigmatic attributes as ""family"" and ""friends"" in the hanebulous finale."

positive;As in almost every one of Burton's productions, the environment (as well as the actors through their specially designed appearance) seems almost surreal and thus very mysterious.

positive;The film is exciting throughout and provides a few laughs with a light breeze of healthy humor.

positive;Negatively, I noticed some time jumps unfortunately because the first meeting at the airport is simply overplayed although I can not imagine that Godzilla would let him escape so easily or the Mato was on the same.

positive;When someone like him is suddenly nominated for a Golden Globe, it makes you sit up and take notice.

positive;The staging is captivatingly precise, the film over 2 hours not only exciting, but also emotionally gripping.

positive;He shows what war does to people and how it changes them.

negative;no matter how good the acting of the two main characters is, the film itself is not.

negative;The charm of a Terence Hill, as well as some supporting characters worth watching, kept me watching the film in its entirety and made the experience more than wasted time.

negative;"In this film, said ""initial phase"" lasted 80% of the film."

positive;Worth seeing...

positive;I hope for more parts.

positive;Even 24 hours after watching it, I keep thinking back.

positive;Star Wars wouldn't be Star Wars without Return of the Jedi Knights, and all three parts are equally the best films of all time.

negative;You can't be serious.

negative;Elysium, on the other hand: clichÃ©, banality, unexciting.

positive;The images are striking and very expressive, and the stars are convincing in their roles as four drug-addicted individuals heading toward their demise.

negative;Tight plot, suspense, action and an outstanding lead actor.

negative;the film takes place in the year 2035, the protagonists are already in their mid-30s, but apart from will smith often have no idea what took place in 2000, very unrealistic!

negative;Both very original and funny.

positive;Hello I can't say it any other way: the film is a classic.

negative;So, if I want a well staged car chase, I'll watch the classics like Bullitt, Ronin and Taxi 1 for all I care, but this is really just bad.

negative;"In the run-up I read things like ""visually stunning masterpiece"" or ""a 3D experience"" and thought to myself that the film is surely not that bad."

positive;Fun remake with a cool cast and a lot of wit!

positive;My tip: go there, rejoice in stubborn winegrowers who love their land and their vines That still exists!

positive;When it suddenly became clear to me that Josh Hartnett was in cahoots with Bruce Willis and on a merciless vendetta, I was more than convinced by Hartnett's performance.

positive;"After cross-reading the reviews, I'm surprised at the polarization potential that is apparently inherent in ""Sin City""."

positive;But up to this point, the film was just great, and knows how to inspire with many Stromberg typical laughs!

negative;Of course, the image of the male role and female role is (unfortunately) still almost everywhere, but a slightly different view of it would have been good.

positive;Yes, the story presses the tear gland - but in a positive sense.

positive;Two other changes have also met with tasteful criticism: First, there are the new - better - special effects.

positive;The two are convincing as enemies, partners-against-will, but also as the first signs of sympathy flash between the characters.

positive;Especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johanson!

positive;Does not matter because otherwise heart, feeling ect.

negative;I was in the mood for some mindless action and I got what I expected.

positive;One is reminded again and again that this is fiction.

negative;Nothing at all!

positive;All in all, I left the cinema satisfied and wanting more, despite higher expectations.

positive;The film exudes an incredible mood, a bloody freedom, between danger and fantasies of omnipotence, as if de Palma had filmed GTA in the eighties - only without the open ending, but with the logical consequence, the insane scream that echoes until no more words come out of the mouth, but blood.

negative;Presents everything that is wrong with the modern media world.

positive;"Everything that needs to be said about ""Psycho"" has already been said."

negative;another one is alive..in my opinion, then maybe someone would have noticed that it is just an evil game..would be only logical or?

positive;Story, humor, actors, logic, thread, etc..     For me a milestone in film history and probably the best film I have seen so far!

positive;The ability to dream yourself into a fantastic story and experience a wonderful fairy tale...!

positive;The film confirms in all respects that even the extra-iridescent can evolve and adapt to modern times.

positive;Step up was quite a nice drama in which a street boy becomes a super couple with the prima ballerina.

positive;"With ""Following"", Christopher Nolan has succeeded in creating a truly outstanding noir thriller that exudes a very special atmosphere, especially due to its low-budget production."

positive;If you are a TMNT fan.

positive;And it was breathtaking.

positive;One of the saddest.

negative;Hardly any suspense, extremely stupid characters and an unbelievable storyline

negative;The dialogues were unfortunately often flat and incoherent, but a few were unexpectedly clever.

negative;A few more tombstones blasted into the air then the whole thing would be a bit more exciting.

positive;A (not necessarily new) but very well realized story, cast with great actors.

negative;A collection of uninteresting characters (office hacks type), entangled in a spindly constructed case that doesn't add much either.

positive;I must say that German/Austrian cinema (Weingartner is Austrian) can surprise me every now and then.

positive;Every single film a small masterpiece - connected only by the theme, love - and the city that gives the film its title.

positive;"Verdict: ""Hostiles"" is hard, sad, extremely rousing, quiet, relentless and leaves you silent before the credits roll."

negative;Acting performances are solid, no outliers up or down.

positive;It should be said that it is perhaps the best Star Wars part, which lives through the humanity of each character, the old flair and the new story about the Force.

positive;The bottom line is that The Thing From Another World is a creepy, exciting, bloody and action-packed splatter shocker of the old school that really makes your blood run cold.

positive;The Jackie Chan movies have never needed a great or deep story - this one doesn't either.

positive;Nice that there are still such films with such a cast!

negative;A subject too often and never well filmed.

positive;Even though the film is not technically outstanding, it has interesting dialogue & makes you think.

positive;Especially the point, you know how it really was, but imagine the situation from the point of view of a resident, wouldn't you have exactly these prejudices?

positive;Good decision!

positive;What was very nicely done was where you opened the glass coffin and the clearing had such a beautiful light.

positive;"One thing ""The Wild Bunch"" clearly shows, however, is that violence fascinates above all else."

positive;Atmosphere: Here the film scores all along the line!

positive;I do not wish any of you to ever get into such a situation and have your soul sold.

positive;The audience has to swallow the opening scenario like Sandra her pills.

positive;"In any case, this film is a very very successful spectacle, which is not only the perfected visual style, but also that this story is exciting, creative and very nice gloomy with the matching black and white harmonizes, so that a very cool mood arises and maintains a certain kind of ""Sin City"", but there is a little more comic in it, but this keiensfalls negative for this film or even for ""Sin City"" affect."

positive;I have already seen the film in English in New Zealand.

negative;But what's the point, the characters are just empty shells either way.

positive;Because what we perceive today as a string of high-grade clichÃ©s was born here!

positive;While the machines around them duplicate the records, they have something unique.

positive;The story is very thin in the process.

positive;"""Into the Abyss"" is more appropriate."

negative;The action just about gets by even though far too little of it is shown.

positive;There are no real lengths, the soundtrack is terrific, you're just really entertained for 111 minutes.

positive;On the other hand, a version with a resolving twist would perhaps be too classical and not as artful.

positive;Starring Nicolas Cage, very well done (!

positive;Verdict: Really worth seeing funny comedy

positive;The light, easy staging as well as the naturally raunchy (but not insensitive) subject matter make sure that an hour and a half flies by and that you have a few laughs (although the scene in which the Kinsey family sits at dinner and Kinsey discusses detailed sex topics with his wife and children is so awful that you want to sink under the table).

positive;The night scenes are very exciting, although it is predominantly one's own expectations that freeze one in the cinema seat.

negative;In the end, he is the hero.

negative;the good old game what the camera does not show, you do not see / hear!

negative;Unfortunately, the film is not particularly convincing in the way it is made.

positive;What emerges on the canvas are dream fantasies, are visions and illusions.

positive;You should definitely take a look at it.

negative;Tomb Raider by Roar Uthaug strives to make Lara Croft a normal young woman, and I have to say, I find that completely silly in a jump-and-run action cracker.

positive;I have the film and can judge it better for me.

negative;The film comes to the 1.

positive;"I saw ""Looking for Eric"" at the sneak yesterday and can say that the Filmstarts review captured this film very well."

positive;The actors are completely convincing.

negative;There are definitely some good gags and allusions, but above all there is a lack of suspense, which I still felt in the previous films: Never does the preparation of the heist come into serious danger, every problem is quickly solved, serious antagonists are missing.

positive;Of course, this requires a special, cinematic empathy.

positive;"I also think that word-of-mouth is ultimately much more positive than the ""official"" reviews were at the beginning."

positive;the 'murders' that are actually 'suicides' are anything but unimaginative gorehappen.

negative;"Friday Night Lights left us with only one question at the end, was the \""Based on a true event\"" at the beginning the legitimacy for an unspectacular film?"

positive;there is a wide range of horror films.

positive;Episode 1 was great and so was Episode 3.

negative;Thus, we have a lot of clichÃ©s what fall into Gerne action, adventure and romance.

negative;"Particularly creepy were mainly not the ""shock"" moments, but the logic holes."

positive;Why wasn't Matt Damon arrested for that at the funeral!

positive;Overall, even though it may not have sounded like it, I am more than satisfied with the result.

positive;So the two set off for the far north and it all turns out to be different than expected.

positive;The actors are convincing in their roles, something that is essential and important in a film like this.

negative;Well-known actors in a gangster comedy where that certain something is missing.

positive;"By the way, those who are afraid of being tortured with the depiction of mass murders like in ""Blood Diamond"" are hereby reassured."

positive;A father who is absolutely trying like a lion to fight for his kids, and it's going to be tough because dad has nothing left to sell.

positive;Of course, African culture is woven into the film.

negative;in my opinion, it is also stupid when mr. mann mixes this film style with glossy shots, which could not be more atmospheric.

positive;The presentation of the images are also in a class of their own.

positive;Normally, something like that leaves me cold, but not with this film.

positive;"A very good film that simply shows the real reality in the largest Camorra neighborhood of Naples; there is the highest drug consumption in the world, all drug addicts from the region come there by bus!"

positive;And here, too, there have been major fluctuations.

positive;Only the ending didn't quite appeal to me.

positive;"Right away : Michael Bay didn't mean anything to me- ""The Rock"" (pension-solidarity-supplement for Mr.Connery otherwise dull commando-soldier bullshit) and ""Armageddon"" (completely overdone, unrealistic asteroid-hero saga)on the other hand did."

positive;You aren't given much of a breather, as the tension is kept extremely high from the evil beginning to the bitterly nasty conclusion.

positive;Sure, Tim Burton's movies aren't everyone's cup of tea, but I really liked Dark Shadows.

positive;But with the bride - Ingenious.

positive;Sounds complicated, but that's how it is in some scenes.

positive;In general, the bridging function between part 1 and 3 was mastered in an exemplary manner.

positive;I have to admit that I suspected something along those lines, but it took a while before the penny really dropped.

positive;The casting of Jake Gyllenhall is also very fitting in my opinion.

negative;However, there are only two of these in the entire film and are thus far from enough to turn the tide and create several WOW moments.

positive;"And Tilda Swinton - after ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" - ""How did you get old, Tilda?"

positive;The claustrophobia in such a cave system alone is well conveyed.

positive;!It was just TOLL!!!!

negative;You can watch it, but you don't have to.

positive;Or the interludes during Snape's Occlumency class.

positive;I wonder what drove all the critics to give it such a bad rating.

positive;I think you are just awesome.

positive;Break in style in which the journalist Robert Graysmith is presented as an identification figure.

positive;The Driver is a very good film because the actors have been carefully chosen.

positive;There is absolutely nothing wrong with the camera work and sound either.

negative;E.G.:  Little Heinrich, (the name is already somehow a prejudice) who marches through the area with the Hitler salute.

positive;The film is just awesome!

positive;Mazursky's freak-out is verbally hilarious, in both English and German, whether or not it's funny against the backdrop of the lost chance to get his brother back!

positive;And as for the legendary shootout, I must say that I've probably never seen anything better staged!

positive;Gary King lives in the past, he can't let go.

positive;It is a pure entertainment film for not even a full 90 minutes.

negative;However, he had never done everything, so far he was only responsible for the Beautiful Meringue Hood camera technique, but here we want to try his skills as a baker/director.

positive;Simply ingenious and thrilling.

negative;"Since ""Shaun Of The Dead"", England has experienced something of a horror boom."

negative;The eigtnlich interesting story was downright spoiled by an action overkill.

negative;"If you've never really been interested in good dialogue, interpersonal relationships, character depth and acting performances in a war movie, and only liked the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" you'll certainly like the film."

positive;Disney follows up.

positive;It's amazing how much wit, charm and action little Ireland can muster!

positive;It's all more or less bite-sized portions from the comics, prepared in a way even non-experts can understand, and a bit lacking in suspense.

positive;On the contrary.

positive;elementarteilchen is in the same league as such ingenious new german films as herr lehmann or 23. ok, the film should probably run under FSK-16.

negative;THE ONLY ONE WHERE YOU DON'T THROW UP OR FALL ASLEEP.

positive;This is what successful new episodes of a series look like, carefully developing the characters, introducing a good and appropriate story and new twists and characters for further episodes - which hopefully will happen, with Alicia Vikander of course.

positive;"And it should always be remembered by all, ""We are all steaks!!!"""

positive;Thank you.

positive;Only the character Drax should not have been so flat.

positive;For me, these are the basic requirement in a good comic.

negative;As you would expect, the first part is by far the best!

negative;The film is a self-contained product and should not expect any further prerequisites from the viewer.

positive;The film sticks very close to its original and also surprises with some very good shock moments.

positive;"And that's where you want such films again these days, even if you could find Hitchcock's dream of a phone booth setting in ""Don't Hang Up"" a few years ago."

positive;But this was only a good way of expressing how quickly people of all ages are carried away by something like this.

negative;Part quite ok.

positive;Kitano plays his yakuza role perfectly.

positive;The story is really exciting thanks to the script.

positive;the actors were good, the plot great (finger in the wound), and the special effects didn't seem contrived like in some other films.

positive;or because many families in Hirushima have disabled children, and all because America is acting as the world's police.

positive;The film never loses respect for the people shown and refrains from judging its protagonists.

positive;"Conclusion: ""Sweeney Todd"" is a film far away from the mainstream and very unconventional."

positive;but when you see the film you are often really excited.

positive;The music is as always in a Star wars movie mega good, but I frankly lacked this main music of Star wars.

positive;Consequently, Bigelow doesn't direct like an Activision developer, and Boal doesn't write like trivial literary figure Dan Brown.

positive;"Nevertheless, Reynolds' variant does not lack independence; instead of intentional love stories, the focus here is on the insecure situation in the Roman province."

positive;I recommend this film to everyone: it is an important part in the history of the Third Reich (besides all the crimes that were committed) that everyone should also know.

positive;Similarly brilliant as the predecessor.

positive;Nevertheless: More of it!

positive;He meets young Yuri, who lives with her husband away from the village by a river, and recognizes in the husband his missing friend.

positive;And experiences on his own body how it is to be a bear. But then Kenai meets the little cuddly bear Koda who is looking for his lost mother.

positive;The approx.

positive;"Until questions like ""Where are you from?"" and ""What are you doing here?"" can be brought to the heptipedes and Dr. Banks can come into the use of a certain gift, a lot of time passes, but with Villeneuve - as usual - without boredom."

positive;The idea was innovative and ingeniously implemented.

positive;The film has a tpy episodic film concept (which is suspiciously similar to that of Magnolia), a rather sedate film pace, and lots of clichÃ©-laden characters.

negative;The last point, however, is that I could hardly recognize any film music here that could contribute a supporting epic effect with regard to the visual events.

positive;The film is partly a classic road movie.

negative;You expect more, but nothing comes.

positive;Otherwise it would be kind of witless, wouldn't it?

positive;You just have to get into it, because it has everything a movie needs.

positive;Exciting, emotional, funny, witty and super Characktere!

positive;It's hard to list everything that's brilliant about the film and why I rate it so highly.

positive;"But Tarantino's latest work not only combines the strengths from ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"", it also shows something completely new."

positive;Just like the special effects: Nothing outstanding but ok.

positive;Road movies take on something magical when they're done well.

positive;It contains the series' synchro, which I think is much more sympathetic than the old one (even if it wasn't bad).

negative;Shade!!!!!!!

positive;The film starts off rather trivial and nothing seems to come close to horror, but it successively develops into an extremely disturbing and gripping psycho thriller, with you getting into a rage yourself towards the end and wanting to get involved in the action right away.

positive;"I personally thought that ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a successful film, although the film has a few quirks, but what action film does not have that?"

positive;CLEAR santi is not MARADONNA and everyone who kicks can do the same (or almost*gg*) as him BUT that's not the point.

positive;In war, the murderer becomes the hero.

negative;Unfortunately, the character developments are not as well done as in the first part.

positive;The start is the finish.

negative;I loved the atmosphere and logic of this science fiction universe.

positive;Despite all the reviews, I have to say that the film is well worth seeing.

positive;The rugged and sometimes bleak beauty of the Highlands.

negative;Sorry but the movie is just bad !

positive;Moreover, the film gets by without pop culture references and thrives on its sometimes quiet, otherwise unobtrusive and cute humor.

negative;In short, I decided to go to the movie and then decide how I liked the new style.

negative;The viewer can't really get into it, the characters suddenly seem rather superficial, and besides, apart from the beautiful surroundings, there's not much to admire.

positive;So I found the film quite well done, is indeed from the plot like the Red Tide but much better implemented.

positive;Those who like humor and action flicks will get their money's worth.

positive;The characters act so comprehensibly and are so powerless.

positive;For this 9/10?

positive;My initial doubts about the graphics in HFR 3D were swept away and nipped in the bud.

positive;At some points, you can literally feel the powerlessness of this father, when he seems to bounce off authorities or entire justice systems, as if against an impenetrable wall.

positive;I mean the harmless film tips over from an entertainment film into a, on closer inspection, dark fable.

positive;- Combining realism, dirtiness and coolness.

positive;Jimi is just great!In the first part he was good, in the second he was better and in the third best!The wild guys are generally just coooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative;What is he trying to tell us and show us?

positive;An individual fate, but representative and symbolic for many others.

negative;The gangster comedy is really nothing special.

negative;So folks, please take this with a grain of salt.

positive;"In the eternal comparison between ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino,"" I take a stand for the predecessor, which I also noticed when I rewatched ""Casino."""

positive;From the description, it looks like a lot.

positive;"TARANTINO IS OUR MAN;FOR REALLY WACKY MOVIES;THAT SWIM AGAINST EVERY CURRENT!"

positive;Robert Downey Jr.

negative;The only thing that can compensate are possibly the scenes where Dastan jumps in time or the good panorama pictures.

positive;10 points from me!!!

positive;The film simply does not bore.

positive;Finally, nothing is held back.

positive;The camera work is pleasing, but - probably due to the low budget - hardly offers an outstanding image.

positive;Found the film very good.

positive;Human, romantic, realistic and dreamlike, in terms of facial expressions and gestures.

positive;Kylo, on the other hand, is like Anakin Skywalker, who likes to freak out and still feels fear.

negative;For me, the film is simply a loose, unspectacular plot with masses of blood, which is probably the only thing that should attract the viewer.

positive;"A western comedy for friends of rather weird humor; 60s spaghetti western meets 90s splattermovie meets 70s exploitation."

negative;but here, too, bay is gambling away its cards.

positive;The role of the author is outstandingly embodied by Sir Michael Caine.

positive;At the beginning, as with most thrillers, everything starts harmlessly but at the climax it gets really ACTION-packed.

negative;I almost fell asleep during some of the shots, even though I'm not really a cinema sleeper.

negative;It's technically good, the effects are worth seeing, the actors a class above the script.

positive;Part somewhat weak)but to the 4.

positive;An absolute sci-fi masterpiece.

negative;Why is Kylo Ren a joke character?

positive;"No one has been this deliciously nasty in a long time, and his character and makeup, as well as his motivation, are strikingly similar to that of Prince Nuada from ""Hellboy 2 - The Golden Army""."

positive;I had a hard time getting into the movie at first, since it was set long before my time ^-^ and then in France.

positive;So the movie was good.

negative;Conclusion: A lukewarm breeze with an unsympathetic main character!

positive;It looked a bit cheap - but also had only a marginal appearance.

positive;In my opinion, just about everything in the film fits.

negative;When at the end men in hats and couples in love run wildly through the bet, with the goal unknown, all hope is already emotionally lost.

negative;Gosling, who I super like to watch, remains pale and actually shows almost only one and the same facial expression throughout the film.

positive;Forget Jason Statham this film surpasses any film of his!

positive;Fans of Denzel Washington will get their money's worth.

positive;I actually went into the film with no great expectations, as I had never heard of the film before.

negative;157 minutes of high tech junk in gamer format are a single insult to the conclusion of this trilogy.

positive;Watcher or player, give risky tasks or take risks to win us money.

positive;So lovingly made, and only this synchronization, .... that falls on you only at an older age, what meaning but this grandiose synchronization wore ...     Great class, my children I will show this film aufjedenfall also times sometime, ha!

positive;The only thing that shocked me was the end because it was not really from the book but that does not have to be bad ... In any case, it is worth watching the film in the cinema!

negative;Primarily, this is simply because the production had far too little time.

positive;His son understands, the daughter does not.

positive;Had a few lengths and Christoph Waltz seemed unintentionally funny at times.

positive;well it wasn't a disappointment .it was a masterpiece what david o russel put down there .too bad he didn't win an oscar .the story is really good and the acting performance is also awesome crime film or comedy whatever that is only recommended.

positive;"Underworld, Resident Evil, etc. don't have ""scary moments"" either."

positive;Tim Burton has struck again.

negative;The plot doesn't even come close to the level of the first two parts.

positive;And both of them together make it serendipitously.

positive;The humor seems strained and cramped in places and also no longer clearly funny.

positive;"But it was also a bit funny that the mother kept calling Justin ""sweetheart"" or ""darling"" as if he was her son."

positive;I have not read any of Sherlock Holmes' books before, nor have I delved further into this person.

negative;His 'villain' is more than superfluous, he could have actually been cut out of the film completely.

positive;What I particularly liked about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was the first half of the film, when the viewer was showered with loud surprises.

positive;After reading most of the reviews here on the forum, I've noticed that most people here are unhappy with the fact that the movie doesn't stick very closely to the book.

negative;Built in 1950 and 1954.

positive;"All in all, ""Enemy of the State No. 1"" is a truly gripping and enthralling high-tension thriller that remains exciting until the very last minute!"

positive;then he goes down to his old department.

positive;"Inside Hollywood with Robert DeNiro or Sofia Coppola's latest work ""The Bling Ring"", Hollywood apparently tries to give insights into the world of the stars."

positive;Cinematic art and acting at its best.

negative;The film offers plenty of action and car chases, but that alone isn't enough for me.

negative;You could really see in the film that the budget was drastically cut compared to the predecessor.

positive;Even as a police officer, I can only give this film my highest praise, and I hope Lisa Wagner has many more opportunities to deliver something like this.

negative;the characters in this film could also be porn actors without a code of honor - see the rape scene.

positive;what is only very important is to let the animals live in their peace.

positive;This is all based on a 16 volume book series, so there's a lot of material to make this movie character go into a long series.

positive;Anna would be well advised to listen to her skeptical uncle, who advises letting the dead bury their dead.

positive;The only thing I would like to say is that there are very drastic setbacks that are hard to digest, which makes it not a normal romantic drama.

positive;The visuals are awesome again, and the effects even more so.

positive;Really very warmly done.

positive;i love christian bale.....he is just great.....and i love christopher nole.....he just makes great movies.....the story is made for cinema.....Fantastico

positive;If one is allowed to be a patriot, then in these cases.

positive;8/10

negative;But the ideas like to convince.

negative;I can't think of much more, but I had to force myself to go through the 1.5 hours.

positive;However, communication problems are the central theme of Babel, which is already revealed by the title, which refers to the Tower of Babel.

negative;"I went to see ""Hitch"" at the movies a few weeks ago and found it quite boring."

positive;But only until then.

positive;First cream.

positive;Abrams outdid himself with the second part and one only waits eagerly for his next project - Star Wars 7

positive;Ok, the main characters I still find mau, but also this time the penguins are the secret stars (is certainly not least because they are again spoken by the fantastic 4).

positive;So I have to honestly say that this was one of the best movies in recent years.

positive;:-) Is it a chick flick?

positive;Although I had to cover my ears (and in some scenes also my eyes) with every second word the actors said, the film still touched me.

positive;However, I found it very good, but also somehow very sad in some places.

positive;...when I read the last comments here.

positive;Black-and-white images with sharp contrasts and stark splashes of color, as well as perfect camerawork that would have thoroughly deserved an Oscar nomination, make every single shot a small work of art.

negative;I must say that the pig is actually only a minor matter and could well have been omitted altogether.

negative;I see it more neutrally: it's just a cinematic screwball about a weirdo who makes his surroundings bearable with his blooming imagination.

positive;Thank you!

positive;Cameron Diaz is incredibly serious and professional.

negative;Not only that many owls resemble each other simply times too much, rather the inexhaustible multiplicity of the guards of the forest are simply hardly to be overlooked.

negative;A few nice effects and that's about it.

positive;Exciting and lively film..... Definitely recommended!

negative;The only worthwhile parts of the film are the few, but impressive close-ups of the island of Iwo Jima while it is being shelled by the Americans (great special effects).

positive;Sarimaus

positive;"I gave it only 9, because some scenes are quite unbelievable (why don't the Trojans stay behind their ""strong walls""?)."

negative;Greetings?

positive;Then again, you put yourself into the rage of the tortured and would like to smack her.

positive;Great soundtrack and excellently acted and directed

negative;The personified evil is back again and does what it seems to do best: fight against a now fifth-rate (?!)

negative;He's just not an actor.

positive;Kekfkgjfuhudjcfiirififirugufkfifudjfueifidixjfkfgkfhntkfkfjcuekxkfkricidiccifffglfrllfgkfortirorigiforotigirifogiftt

positive;simply wonderful.

negative;But I would have expected a little more or they could have gotten more out of the basic idea of the film!

positive;In 90 minutes, an exchange year is presented in an extremely entertaining way, with all the obstacles, problems, but also joys and satisfaction.

positive;But that pays off pretty well in the end.

negative;In just such there is a certain sense of style and atmosphere.

positive;"The ""standard interpretation"" of the dream is not enough for me."

positive;Rather, he strictly an interpersonal story in a setting that doesn't seem so fictional to the viewer.

negative;Action scenes are so overdone, the main thing is that their Bond looks cool.

positive;During the dealer visits in the film, the socio-critical aspect of the film noticeably recedes into the background, and the trashy fun of unabashedly crude action is given free rein.

positive;- a few spoilers_ although I think you can spoil this movie without harming it.

positive;I was already from the 1.

positive;I rarely recommend movies, as I find most of them to be absolutely stupid and boring.

positive;For it is not so much that Luke is being hunted, but rather that he has to see how he is being antagonized and closed off.

positive;"only after hangover i saw ""brÃ¼no"", which i found hilarious (i know it's not everyone's humor, but mine is), so for a short time this was the best comedy, until yesterday = zack & miri showed me!"

positive;Diane KrÃ¼ger and Justin Bartha with his pithy oneliners also play top.

negative;The actual story, however, deals with a war tragedy and its effects on those left behind.

positive;After walking about 500 meters, I see them, huge monsters.

negative;After that, it fortunately gets better, but never reaches the intensity of the predecessor.

positive;After I drove 180 km last weekend to see this film, which I find very regrettable on the one hand, the special character of the film on the other hand by the quaint charm of that cinema far away from CineStar and Co.

positive;Joss Whedon is a genius!

positive;As mentioned earlier, the story is pretty good and interesting throughout.

positive;"Not much more needs to be said about this movie than ""Wayans Brothers"" !!!!"

negative;Because this aspect has unfortunately been given far too much focus.

positive;), the incredibly likeable characters, the great music, the exuberant happiness that the film conveys ... oh damn, I will not find the right words to logically express why the film means so much to me, I just recommend it unreservedly to everyone, even if most will just dismiss it as a completely irrelevant comedy!Conclusion: For me, the best, happiest and most versatile party comedy ever!

positive;Josh Brolin in particular is something you see more and more in cinema and he has an immense presence.

positive;Saw it 1 time, saw it 2 times .... Awesome movie.

positive;Sam Raimi's original was a true horror cult film in my generation.

positive;This movie shows me again why Batman is my favorite comic book hero.

positive;His story captivates with gripping and interesting twists that often appear unexpectedly and thus give the film a lot of impact.

positive;Or, everyone believed that Casino Royale with Daniel Craig could only be bad.

negative;Hello everyone, since yesterday I have now also seen T3.

positive;"Only very rarely does a film manage to bring its message to the screen as aptly, unobtrusively and entertainingly as ""Dallas Buyers Club"": an honest-to-goodness plea for more tolerance, more self-determination, but above all for more humanity."

positive;If you expect a thriller story or horror effects, you should stay away from this film.

positive;Hicks, too, has changed significantly in recent years and he has, how could it be otherwise, grown up and must gradually come to terms with the fact that he will follow in his father's footsteps, but he still can not really make friends with it.

negative;Now and then there are a few good laughs, but on the whole it is unfortunately limited.

positive;On the first point, I don't think I need to explain to anyone here the genius and formative influence of the director on posterity.

positive;Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the dubbing, since I only got the original DVD from the USA as a gift.

positive;This is clearly at the expense of emotionality and empathetic feeling in some important scenes.

positive;i was particularly pleased to see burak, a young turkish man.

negative;If you're not a Rocky fan, the movie won't do you any good at all.

positive;"when McClane is killing one after the other of his people, and makes him angry with his sayings (or should make him angry), this actor, who plays Thomas Gabriel, just doesn't get excited at all... he doesn't build up any anti sympathy, nothing at all, the opponents of McClane have ALWAYS been hated somehow, especially in 1 +3 Rickman and Irons were great, but this Olyphant is just bad and his whole ensemble as well, also the ""asia"" aunt is completely boringly designed and plays boringly... too bad, because good opponents are elementary important for a good hero."

negative;All in all, some pseude teen love drama that you don't need to see.

positive;It could not have been realized better and more emotionally.

positive;So whoever argues like this has probably only seen half of the film?!

positive;bomb film but probably the worst syncronization of all time.

positive;You just can't hold back the tears....

positive;The film reveals a decadent world that ordinary citizens neither understand nor want to understand.

positive;The film is peace and it shows us that every minute, even when it throws us into a battle between Japanese and Americans, so the pantheism in the film always pleads for peace!

negative;or the classic david versus goliath.

positive;He makes me smile, even grin, but never loses a certain sense of entitlement and every now and then he makes me very thoughtful, only to make me smile right back.

positive;The complex plot is charged by the rousing and symphonic music of Nightwish, which adds poetry and beauty to the darkness.

positive;I hope the film reaches and teaches many people.

positive;I do not like, but here they fit!)

negative;The problem here: If you absolutely want to be brutal in the film, then the blood should also splash properly, then an exaggerated-ironic distance to what is shown must become clear.

negative;Due to a high rating from filmstarts.de, which I usually trust to make a correct assessment, I went for this film.

negative;I'm really hoping that 'The Purge: Election Year' (out this year) will fill in my gaps there.

positive;Depp and Carter are great once again, as well as the rest of the cast.

positive;SIMPLY GREAT!

positive;The scenario of the film reminds one of movies like Roland Emmerich's ,,Independence Day'', ,,The Contact'' or Spielberg's ,,War of the Worlds''.

positive;In my opinion, the best films are those that succeed in creating a unique atmosphere.

positive;It's quite amazing when you look at the Norwegian film market.

positive;For example, in the book, Gandalf leaves the traveling community for a long time and is silent about his goals.

positive;Doesn't quite come close to the second part, but it's not bad either!

positive;My disappointment of the film is clearly Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, who sounds with his sentences and views as if he wants to campaign for the Greens.

positive;A film as powerful and incisive as a hurricane sweeping through an avenue of half-rotted trees, a storm of images that won't let you go for nights.

positive;"No one would ever do that in reality."""

positive;I don't think any better actors could be given these roles.

positive;Definitely watch it!

positive;Who has already had the luck in life from birth to live successfully and carefree.

negative;You have to remember that this is a children's movie.the first part was much more fun than the 2 and 3.but as it is with the movies the sequels are myst worse.I would buy it for my children but certainly not for me.

positive;Ok, so the title isn't exactly a bummer, but I still wanted to give the movie a chance.

positive;If that's not enough, a young talent like Mark Ruffalo also shows his best side in this film.

positive;The film gives you the feeling of a cult film and is in many places a homage to old blockbusters and classics like E.T.. Small lengths are unfortunately still present.

positive;Everything just fits...it's quite a work of art to pull the film off in such a geeky way over 2 hours and never lose the density of entertainment/suspense or comedy.

positive;"yes and think about his own life with the ""plastic""."

positive;In the end, this is mainly due to the actors and dances. Everything is just right in this film.

positive;^^, I've ers thought that the film totally boring and so is, abba then he was pretty good, the romantic parts war the coolest!

positive;"""The Templar's Legacy"" does its thing very well, though!"

positive;"Lets his pioneers quite incited and with the same fervor (you can sometimes even see the fire in McCougney's eyes directly) as the technology-enthusiastic ""We'll do it"" - 68 generation launch into space and search for the impossible."

positive;Unfortunately, the end is a bit too flat for me and therefore 1 star deduction!

positive;The performances by DiCaprio and Foxx are also outstanding.

positive;Nevertheless, IpMan 2 is better than its predecessor.

positive;But here it was portrayed without kitsch, without pathos, with realistic problems and multi-layered characters.

negative;That a film should somehow depart from the book and go its own way can't justify that.

positive;When one of the students finally tries to take his own life, Petra threatens to make the case public.

positive;Well, reaching a target audience with this work is difficult: children won't understand the irony and side-swipes, while older ones will be put off by the childish drawing style.

positive;So it's not surprising that he prefers to 'play' with a guy he finds interesting instead of hanging out with the boring gang members and gets mad when someone takes his toy away.

negative;But that is a matter of opinion.

positive;"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is well realized, so we immediately felt transported back to the magical world."

positive;And how human it all is.

positive;b) the far too early turnaround in the story, already after a little more than half of the film.

positive;"Chu manages to catapult a dance firework onto the screen through the very convincing lead actors (especially Briana Evigan as ""Andie"" and Adam G. Sevani as ""Moose"") also through the good soundtrack (by Timbaland, Missy Eliott, FloRida and T-Pain among others)."

positive;"The tone of the film shifts from suspenseful to dramatic to funny; every note is spot on and this makes for a nice change of pace."

positive;Always provided you like comic book movies and especially the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

negative;Everyone liked the movie.

positive;"He doesn't force an opinion on the viewer but lets him decide for himself what the viewer thinks is right in the ""fight"" against such a regime."

positive;"Maybe Luo Xiao Hu, the ""Black Cloud"" loves Yu Jen, but this is not true for Yu Jen, she is fighting (or just playing around)."

negative;End time atmosphere is missing here!

positive;Since the media is always about Tom Cruise being obsessed with Scientology, etc., you forget about it.

positive;This movie is just awesome.

negative;This movie is o.A.

negative;The continuation, I see just because of the grottigen end, exceedingly critically against.

positive;Very good film about the difference between love of adventure and love of country.

positive;The audience figures are also impressive worldwide.

positive;All in all, a really nice comedy!

positive;However, I have a question for all those who have also seen the film: What's in the envelope DiCaprio gives the psychologist before he disappears?

positive;No action bullet train is to be expected here.

positive;"I had expected a ""normal"" action movie and was very pleasantly surprised here."

positive;"However, the presentation of the film is really well done, even if someone who doesn't know the material can hardly comprehend the threat of a Sephiroth or Jenova, as it is somewhat underlit - be sure to watch the bonus DVD ""Last Order"" before the actual film."

positive;Very good film from the 70s!

positive;The characters seem so real and although the whole plot could be considered a bit overplayed, he spits the cold truth in everyone's face.

negative;The obligatory love story is just an uninspired subplot and the ending is anything but surprising.

negative;The cinema was 30% full.

negative;Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more depth, and I wasn't particularly convinced by the characters either.

positive;To do this, he needs blood and this is where Larry's consort Julia comes in... You can find the full review here:

negative;In addition, two excellent actors dress the two main characters.

positive;The film deals with the topic of immigration to the USA in a very differentiated and sensitive way.

positive;However, the action scratches a bit at the credibility of the plot when a somewhat dimwitted cop is able to take out 3 bank robbers by himself.

positive;The others also throw themselves full Lotte into the written words and so a bitter, hard family drama arises that does not deliver any visual show values, but emotional highlights.

negative;Adolescent book adaptations are increasingly becoming a genre of their own and increased extremely, especially this year.

positive;In the foreground for humorous interludes is of course Teddy Bear Ted.

positive;Now the subplots of the story and the shallowness at the beginning of the film give meaning and participate in the refinement of Jep Gambardella.

positive;A successful film with many exciting scenes.

positive;After the rather poor 2nd half of the year

positive;More is not to be revealed here.

negative;The world-famous mimes can't show off their acting talent at all.

negative;Bourn is of course a very good example.

positive;Delicate minds and fans of superficial Hollywood movies with happy endings should give this flick a wide berth due to the sometimes violent depiction of violence and the overall disturbing plot.

positive;I saw the film in Austria and am thrilled, although I normally don't care much for classical music.

positive;Went into this movie with a lot of preconceptions.

positive;In addition, the beautiful, expressive images and the strong characters are another reason to watch this film.

positive;That would be, on the one hand, a very good cast (Kevin Spacy as Lester Burnham), an excellent gripping story with many elements such as tragedy, drama and funny to satirical components.

negative;Entertain?

positive;Effects?

positive;The refreshing dialogues, appropriately adapted from the novel by neurologist Lisa Genova, also contribute to this.

positive;Orgies of Violence:    Braindead 120 Days of Sodom Cannibal Holocaust Cannibal Ferox Faces of Dead (all parts, despite fakes) etc Violent movies:    Dance of the Devils Re-animator Zombi Woodoo Day of the Dead Kill Bill etc Quite violent movies:    True Romance Running Scared Dawn of the Dead (2004) etc Average brutal movies: Pulp Fiction The Blob Scream (1+2) Schindler's List Saving Private James Ryan Dance of the Devil 2 etc Little violence Pan's Labyrinth (!)

positive;You can't identify or sympathize with any of the characters, who remain very flat except for Yuri, his brother and the arms dealer Weisz.

positive;Shocking , exciting , top !

positive;All the figures allow a look that excludes any sense of artificiality.

positive;But for those who like the penchant for aesthetics, the film is a must and will entertain splendidly.

negative;Just a typical straightforward revenge and conspiracy flick without surprises with some decent action scenes, bigger story holes and some very weak dialogue.

positive;3D, high frame rate.

positive;Highly recommended insider tip, the film would have deserved far more viewers in my opinion.

positive;"Zoe ""Annamaria"" Saldana (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") also plays a crucial role."

positive;No Oscar again.

positive;"And one more thing, Filmstarts.de: ""Happy Gilmore"" is a masterpiece."

positive;The subsequent escape of the protagonists - also great, what is there to deny?

positive;There are movies that are instant classics.

negative;Are you still there?

positive;A story with a lot of emotion, lust, love, joy and drama.

positive;The hundred and thirty minutes seem like twice as long!

negative;I always had the feeling that half of it was missing here, which also led to the fact that for almost the entire second act I had no idea what was actually going on on the screen.

positive;Unfortunately, you have no idea at all about good movies and plenty of them.

positive;Kim Basinger in ideal casting.

positive;The facial expressions of the lions are particularly well worked out.

negative;Of course it's just a short film and of course it's a bit bizarre, but those 30 minutes didn't appeal to me at all.

positive;The film also shows a little bit of the history of America.

negative;It only gets quite nice from the middle on.

positive;WÃ¤r the film badly finds has him simply not understood or with the topic nix am hut the insiders know what is meant by the film and what is criticisirt with it!

positive;He radiates an aura, a presence.

positive;So from me in any case 8 points.

positive;Bottom line: Kramer's goal with this film isn't up front, but it's there.

negative;It's all just muddled.

negative;i give this movie 5 points because some parts are drawn out....

positive;The story is very clear, and it actually works without much depth, but the light irony doesn't turn it into a total trivial work.

negative;And finally, there remains Legolas, who seems to have mutated into a super-elf.

positive;The rest of the characters are really just there, they don't get much characterization, but they do have a personality and so it's all okay, especially since we're dealing with a comic book adaptation.

positive;Absolute recommendation.

positive;"Our laws make it so easy."""

negative;That was it.

negative;"And the deliberately posed scenes, like the one with his ""producers"" and the one with Pamela (tell my grandma that was real)."

negative;I also found the story boring.

negative;Thus, the film is nothing whole and nothing half.

positive;The mental borrowings from 'Excalibur' or the sleeping potion in 'Romeo and Juliet' don't disturb at all, but fit well into the picture, which is often kept gloomy and thus creates the necessary atmosphere.

negative;Saw this movie in the sneak as well.

positive;"For fans of crazy space movies that don't take their own myth excessively seriously, ""Valerian"" will prove to be a lucky find."

negative;"The presentation is quite ok, it's a great, sun-drenched film that has the image of ""romance"" oozing out of every pore."

positive;It's all about Bullock, and rightly so.

positive;Everything is just right with this film.

positive;I came across the film rather by accident, and was totally surprised how good it is.

positive;We see a depressed sun and sultry suburbs.

negative;Since I had almost no expectations of the film, I was not disappointed...but also not surprised.

positive;I think the idea of making a musical out of the material is great.

positive;Garnished with action, great images, and broader approaches to family, self, and medical/technical ethics.

positive;But also the uncertainty he must feel about what may happen next in this hideous extermination machine.

positive;I have only seen this and the first Rambo part and this one really convinced me.

positive;I was equally unsurprised when I heard that the sequels were virtually shredded by critics.

positive;Unfortunately, I know few in my circle who appreciate this film.

positive;Very cool and magical!!!

positive;There are actually very few scenes like that here, but nevertheless you get your money's worth as a goosebump fan.

negative;Conclusion: I clearly hoped for more and am therefore already very disappointed.

negative;The main plot of the story, was so stupid that I am at a loss for words.

positive;Such a film is a stroke of luck!

negative;I'd rather watch Mary Poppins!

positive;A film that I didn't have particularly high expectations for in advance.

positive;(Probably supposed to embody the excessive amount of sensitivity of some women, which, however, is not exactly advantageous in view of the apocalyptic threat of the living dead).

negative;That's why the ending is so illogical that it screams spoiler: Is the whole perfidious plan of the underground based on the fact that the game leader is a rebel, all those who were already suspicious are in cahoots and the protagonist gets the idea to shoot an electric arrow at the dome at exactly the right moment, where two minutes later a flying ship picks up the lady?

negative;However, one then leans back willingly, lets it pass over one's head, and perhaps, contrary to expectations, it even turns into a nice afternoon.

positive;And especially his exaggerated ego with a tendency to overestimate himself and self-confidence, often gets him into trouble.

positive;Even during a torture scene I couldn't help myself, even though I'm not a fan of films like saw or hostel.

negative;"Then he is on the safe side with Gerard Butler in ""Olympus/London has fallen""."

positive;Thus, the film's successful choice of name should also be noted on the sidelines this time, which is logical even in the actual as well as metaphorical sense.

negative;Sure the figure play great but sure figure play bad.

positive;He also showed great courage with the ending and sent a signal that Disney doesn't just stand for love stories.

negative;In any case, I would rather pump the money into the video store than go to this movie.

negative;Instead of embodying the world of the computer (Tron 1), they decided to embody a simulated world (ala Matrix), but why the hell does everything have to be so mechanical?

negative;I am referring exclusively to the heavily abridged cinema version of Hans W. GeiÃŸendÃ¶rfer's film version of Thomas Mann's complex mammoth work, which I was privileged to attend as a high school student in a Kassel cinema.

positive;A reboot that made sense for once!

positive;Of course, everyone has his own opinion, but the special effects and the transformation of the kelien Ani to Lord Vader is simply bombastic!

negative;Perlman still cuts quite a figure, but everything else remains pretty pale.

positive;But this is never over the top and always fits the situation, it simply results from the actions of the characters and that is a long extinct art.

negative;The film starts well, has its interesting moments, however, I must say: There could have been made much more out of it!

negative;The story itself sounds like fast action or something like a video game adaptation where a troop of people fight their way through a utopian train, from compartment to compartment or level to level.

positive;The positive points of criticism are the absolutely brilliant camera work, the impressive scenery and the absolutely perfect realization of the story, which is based on a true incident.

positive;The appearance of the Spaniards and the open question of their function offer the viewer many possibilities to end the film according to their own understanding of the setting.

negative;Have the standards of the corresponding editors already dropped so far due to the Hollywood overkill?

positive;The film is really mega!

positive;You can also tell that the main actors are in their element.

negative;No further development, confused, confused concept of life, desperate struggle against old age - this is how Woody Allen presents himself.

positive;The script by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman bubbles over with quotations, satirical allusions, snotty dialogues, cool online characters and takes all previous comic book adaptations for a ride with wacky and very unusual ideas that you just can't stop laughing.

positive;The idea of such a terrible subject, like the murder of a boy with so much humor to implement is really brave one can assume that there is only a delicious leidenstortur of a film out of it.

positive;All three main actors play fabulously.

positive;"A really good film with lots of twists and turns and a completely atypical (and for that very reason strong character Bondgirl; alone the dialogue between 007 and her in the plane - that had depth!)."

positive;Placing this universe of the conquest of urban spaces at the center of a drama allows Florian Gaag to analyze graffiti in a more differentiated way than would ever be possible from the distance of the documentary filmmaker.

positive;The music also fits in well with the film.

positive;In any case, Tarantino has succeeded here a timeless masterpiece that you should at least have seen.

positive;I really liked it and it was a lot of fun to follow the movie.

negative;The beginning is quite well done and makes you want more.

positive;"The United States of the future has degenerated into a surveillance state in which attempts are made to solve the problems through the consumption of the novel drug ""Substance D"" (D for Death)."

negative;You don't get much smarter than what you learn in class and thus the film is unfortunately sub-par.

positive;By the time of the final happy ending, statistically he has noticeably lowered the crime rate in Paris and boosted the Parisian funeral parlors.

positive;Here as there a typical, normal morning at a school is demonstrated, one observes almost arbitrarily and randomly scenes of a normal school day which are shown again and again from different perspectives so that the scenes repeat themselves at several intersections (in one scene a student sits on the school toilet and hears someone throwing up in the next cubicle, in the later course there is the scene again from the view of the puker).

positive;The ending also leaves nothing to be desired.

positive;Great.

negative;Since John Rambo he has really become ugly again.

positive;Although the first fight scene can be accused of being arbitrarily justified in its existence, it clearly shows what The Raid 2 can do: Crazy camera movements in the tightest of spaces, incredibly dynamic pans and cuts, motion sequences brought to perfection and ingenious ideas within the fights.

negative;For me only ne mediocre comedy, tension goes against zero and the 1.5 hours seemed to me, exaggerated, like 3 hours.

positive;Lately, only a few movies have really thrilled me, where I could keep the plot in mind the whole evening.

negative;Thought the movie would be funnier (the movie was also billed as a comedy).

positive;The film is so moronic that it's genius all over again.

negative;Written by: Marcin Dylong

negative;The actors/characters are all unfortunately interchangeable.

positive;X-Men 1 had to introduce all the characters, but now that this was done, it could really crack.

positive;The dubbing voices:PERFECT!

positive;An absolutely awesome movie, I must admit, the best I've ever seen.

positive;I reject such an assumption, without wanting to give the word of a natural irreconcilable antagonism between individual and society, which always likes to develop behind the back, when people with their socialist ideals and visions - an absurdity to clothe the concept of socialism ideally - maltreat society, as soon as they have come to power.

positive;"The story could have been easily fit into a 90-minute movie and in the 148 minutes that ""Jackie Brown"" lasts, there are neither particularly varied locations nor constant surprises to see, but rather Tarantino pays increased attention to the characters and gives them every conceivable space that the plot does not need."

positive;You can just dive in, like a nightmare, but one that stays in your mind and you can relive over and over again.

positive;But how this idea was implemented is simply ingenious.

negative;Technically, the film is superbly made.

positive;Above all, through the dense narrative, exciting film, but also remarkable in its performances and its realization.

negative;Otherwise, there is nothing new, especially for anyone who knows the fairy tale - but that doesn't make the film bad.

negative;However, if you ask yourself how you can write such junk, how you can film such junk and above all, why there are good actors who play in such junk, you will probably not have found an answer to that yet and I suspect you won't find one in the future either.

positive;to all: this film is absolutely top class!!!

negative;a big budget comedy with a star cast, but churlish, unfunny, muddled.

positive;Head cinema -with great pictures- will probably never have a large fan base

negative;A good (fight) film, which advertises but with Van Damme, which appears but quite rarely^^ The training scenes are already cool made, nice trashy :lol: Otherwise, everything here is crap, only the fights are good!

positive;At home, this visual appeal is almost completely absent.

positive;However, there was also the one or other scene that gives you goosebumps when Dom

positive;It seems less contrived than in the new Wall Street movie, for example.

positive;Here we are clearly dealing with an action masterpiece.

positive;There's a person you're doing the tutorial with.

negative;I didn't find that exciting at all.

positive;I recommend this movie to everyone, comic book fan or not.

positive;After just a few sessions with Ava, he realizes that something is not right....

positive;These questions resonate.

positive;: Nice that there are still Disney movies with the original soundtrack.

positive;However, the Jesus role affected me deeply.

positive;It's all about the stuff around it: the actors, the conversations (Hello?

positive;"It happened in the nineties that screenwriter and writer William Goldman - to whom film history owes masterpieces such as ""Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid"", ""Marathon Man"" and ""The Princess Bride""; also ""The Ghost and the Darkness"" and a cucumber like ""Dreamcatcher"" should not go unmentioned (no one in the business has only good days) - created a script of exceptional quality in the quiet closet."

positive;If you're looking for a complex story, you've come to the wrong place.

positive;This one is actually told in five minutes and the twists are also limited, which I think is a shame.

positive;Evil'', Eli Craig has succeeded in creating a splatter comedy with pitch-black humor that is different, (hillbillies being hunted by college students!

positive;Especially with the latter, this film is absolutely revolutionary, and impressive.

positive;It is logical to insert an adversary against whom both will fight together!

positive;At their first meeting, Lionel pulls an involuntary stunt when he stumbles backwards into the streetcar.

positive;Even computer animation serves a higher purpose here, namely a metaphorical one (ant in subway).

positive;The priest belongs to the armed hunters.

positive;Will Smith as well as Gene Hackman play their best roles here.

positive;Inglourious Basterds has become a really strong and once again typical Tarantino film.

positive;By the way, the German version is cut, which I can't understand, because I don't find it overly brutal at all.

positive;Rarely are film adaptations better.

positive;Stunning.

positive;Although the third part is not quite as good as its predecessors, you still take your time to follow the Corleone family.

positive;Ryan Philippe, just like Laura Linney, does a very good job within the given possibilities, but you should be aware that this film stands and falls with Chris Cooper.

positive;The religious connection between Judaism, Islam (islÄm / Ø¥Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…) and Christianity was also interesting.

positive;The film left me with a feeling of trepidation, especially because that's how you experienced the time itself.

negative;This movie didn't scare me for a second.

negative;How can you sympathize with such a villain.

positive;"But I personally don't understand how it differs so much from other films in terms of quality, because for me it lacks that certain ""something""."

positive;Because what she sees are lies, deceit and betrayal.

negative;Good approaches, poor implementation!

negative;Especially the stuttering actor seems unbelievable.

positive;For adult audiences with a slight affinity for splatter, however, definitely recommended.

positive;This could have been solved much more elegantly.

negative;JOHN WICK doesn't have it so with women either.

positive;The film captivates and entertains until the last minute !

positive;The deduction is, however, at the end.

positive;The journey from baby monkey to leader of the monkeys, that's just a great view of a character change that I've seen so, so rarely.

positive;Conclusion: An absolutely gripping drama from Russia.

positive;Surprisingly realistically portrayed and very convincing.

positive;Masterpiece.

positive;His overall restrained playing is all the more haunting.

positive;diaz but this role was her best!!!

positive;"The character Karl remains for me a purely asserted figure; and Hans seems to have no problems at all, a kind of Alexis Zorba apparently, who wants to redeem us petrified big-city people from our everyday rigidity."

positive;I'll deduct a few points for the fact that the film is a bit too long at times.

positive;Just came from the movie and can certify this film a status close to genius.

positive;I would like to thank Claudia for pointing me to the German BBM forum.

positive;Definitely the scarier specimens of undead for me.

positive;still a very, very great film!

positive;I really like Thomas Jane as an actor and I liked him in his role.

positive;And that's where Borat comes in.

negative;Story itself confusing.

negative;Nevertheless, those who like Jean Reno may risk a look.

negative;A couple of friends, who want to do some caving, decide to go off the map into unexplored territory.

positive;"Alex Garland, the writer of screenplays for such notable films as ""Sunshine,"" ""All We Had to Give"" and ""28 Days Later,"" sits down in the director's chair for the first time for ""Ex Machina"" and didn't miss the chance to write the script himself."

positive;Partly I was really shocked what I saw there and this documentary has definitely left a lasting impression.

positive;Horny!

positive;The second part I liked even better than the first, which was already extremely good.When I saw the film (Part 1 u.2) for the first time I liked the first better.However, V.Cassel exudes an incredible charisma u. convinced with absolute versatility.

positive;"This criticism is obvious to everyone, but in this film, it is not nourished by unmistakable dialogues, as in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"", but drives the film forward in the interaction of the protagonist with his environment."

negative;Not bad but not really good either despite big names.

positive;The feeling and the idea of something truly terrible is imminent, is really well planted in the viewer at the beginning of the movie and forms the basis of the entire upcoming film.

negative;- Many scenes from the trailers are missing: No Cyborg rising into the sky with full visor, no visit for Alfred, no Flash dodging shots from Paradoxons and Cyborg also not saving a policeman and Steppenwolf's statement is missing.

negative;"When something is said, the most common response is: ""aha"", ""good"", ""ok""."

positive;A shocked mother who seeks justice and resorts to unusual measures, that's already the whole plotline where I thought it was about being able to present a culprit at the end.

positive;There are always people in the film who are just extras to eventually and finally get killed.

positive;A very exciting scene.

negative;From 3-4 interesting aspects, here was a nearly 2.5h long, dull, clichÃ©d, implausible, and towards the end very idea-poor fairy tale marketed.

positive;He plays Oberhauser really cool and emotionless.

negative;"I have to admit, I was very surprised when I saw the trailer for ""Bedtime Stories"" for the first time in the cinema and also that it didn't convince me very much."

negative;A lot of it seems cheesy and way too far-fetched.

positive;But all the characters fulfill their roles.

positive;For lovers of films in black and white an absolute must.

positive;But well, film is ultimately art and art is a subjective matter of opinion.

positive;This is anything but a B-movie.

negative;Every now and then the film gets an emotional side, but in the end it's annoying, because Smith plays the family man again!

negative;Sure there are a few messages at the end of the movie, but the movie doesn't really have a good story worth telling.

positive;Rather, it is about international cooperation, press, research and handling sensitive information in a world population on the verge of panic.

positive;Season and is supposed to be a foretaste for the 7th season.

positive;Looking forward to more from him and of course R2 and 3Po

positive;What a great film and those will now be surprised that I dedicated myself to such a film, however, there has been something where I myself would not have believed.

positive;I also ask that if there is a possible sequel, that Joss Whedon be hired again.

positive;Because I just can't picture Brosnan or even Connery as 007 in the most touching scene of the film.

negative;The story is just too flat.

positive;- makes.

positive;Conclusion: An aesthetically unbelievably brilliant psychological thriller with surprising developments, but minor flaws in the details, which are just at the expense of the behavior of the characters.

positive;The only thread in the action remains the Doc with his spliff.

negative;Conclusion: Loud and spectacularly put on, but tinkered with the franchise in a penetrating way!

positive;"The fact that the cause of the relationship crisis of the American couple (their third child died of the so-called ""early infant death"")."

positive;";)"

positive;The other actors are like in the series & at the end it gets a little exaggerated, but still related to reality!

positive;There is enough tension.

negative;Boah, that was a horror last night!

negative;You can immediately see what is real and what was created in the computer.

positive;excellent enemy are the borg, who represent something completely new in hollywood's oh so hackneyed enemy pool.

negative;So maybe it was the dubbing, but I think I've rarely been as negatively impressed as I was after this movie.

positive;In the re-synchro...well at most 4/10 I know: It's a bit weird to make it so much about the dubbing.... but please...?!?!

positive;In doing so, Barber sends his lead actor Michael Caine as avenging angel Harry Brown on the hunt for the drug dealers and gangsters who beat his best friend to death and doesn't care about political correctness in any way, which is perhaps one of the film's biggest plus points.

positive;The fact that Kirk holds a monologue at the end, which is untypical for him, I find quite appropriate.

positive;The fact that the bass is a bit lacking may be due to age, but on a full-blown system it sounds better than some contemporary TV series.

positive;Stunts and no cheap CGI effects.

positive;It's surprising that Jodie Foster isn't being used to promote the film.

negative;Who nevertheless goes to this film, I can only advise one thing: Switch off your brain.

positive;(Honestly girls, who is not melted at the sight of Jude Law?)

positive;This is his best performance in a long time.

negative;World War II.

negative;My girlfriend alone went to see it 3 times in the cinema.

positive;John Goodman's final fate is too off for me personally, as is Carl Reiser's ending (already shown in the preview).

positive;To mention a few more famous names, Jeff Fahey and Bruce Willis should also be mentioned here.

negative;''Unknown Identity'' disappointed me a little.

negative;Especially when she has all the inhabitants killed with her first official act...because she doesn't know what to do with them...After the time jump, however, the film becomes more banal from scene to scene.

positive;But the rest of the cast also does its job more than well.

positive;They present an exciting and fast-paced story spiced with a lot of humor and funny situations (keyword: Stark's communication with his machine helpers).

positive;I thought the movie was really good.

positive;Wonderful pictures.

negative;Stolen from a lot of movies and cobbled together wildly.

negative;It's amazing that no one has rated the film here yet, even though it's running as a blockbuster movie in almost all Cinemaxx cinemas and the like.

positive;Nice teen romance that has some sense of reality.

positive;Mills: Genius!!!

positive;Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece here, portraying the Maya and their culture as a frighteningly cruel yet highly advanced people!

positive;Why not directly at the Starfleet outpost, where Spock could already be?

positive;Di Caprio also shows that he is really a very good actor, just like Samuel L. Jackson.

positive;Of all things, a drama like this one contains what I consider the most suspenseful sequence I've ever seen in a movie - when Chris O'Donnell enters the hotel room where Pacino is about to shoot himself, the scene turns into a 10-minute psychological thriller that has you holding your breath.

positive;The ending is also successful, although not as surprising as Saw, but the viewer is satisfied with the ending.

positive;Some sequences are so absurd that you are happy to see something so cool on the screen.

positive;A chamber play which Hitchcok himself could not have done better.

positive;Good movie!

positive;The round is boisterous, one of the soldiers is celebrating his father's happiness and everyone is excited about the movie star in their midst.

negative;a suggestive question because - yes, it exists!

positive;Finally again a film about which one can and must think!

positive;Those who can live with narrative clichÃ©s, especially in the second half, will experience a great piece of cinema!

negative;Completely exaggerated action without sense and reason, which was cut way too fast and on top of that totally messed up with way too much shaky cam and any zooms-ins.

positive;the film makes you think about your own ending - your interpretation of the flood of images.

positive;The cast is top notch and all actors deliver skillfully.

negative;"----------------------------------------------------------------- In ""The Hijacking of the Pelham 123 Subway"" everything and everyone remains below their capabilities."

positive;A great film - excellently directed, superbly acted (especially, of course, by Cillian Murphy) and perfectly scored.

positive;I was also completely surprised by the harshness as it occurs here.

positive;so long, choizz

positive;PS: Better try not to get disturbed while watching, because that can really spoil your mood.

positive;You also manage to perfectly combine emotion, action, drama/tragedy in this film.

positive;I won't say a word about the content, because that is the big surprise.

negative;"And that's a bit confusing when the actual film is a film that tries to convey a positive ""get a grip"" feeling despite the sad hero and the unattractive basic constellation."

negative;"Batman Begins and ""The Dark Knight"" captivated and thrilled me immensely."

positive;As usual cool, casual and some sayings on the lips.

negative;Indeed, the Freemasons were at that time an honorable secret society composed of the best masons of the country.

positive;Visually convincing are also the main actors Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac absolutely convincing.

positive;I already thought the movie would be good (even though I couldn't imagine WHAT in the movie would be good), but for it to be this good....

negative;So an application for a nice vacation or a great destination Berlin in Berlin syndrome truly does not give.

positive;Well, I just saw the film with a friend at the SneakPreview and we were very divided.

positive;Since then I've seen him more than a dozen times and he still hasn't lost any of his class.

positive;But that's how it has to be in a film like this.

negative;I just didn't care about him at all.

negative;If you just want to watch something harmless and nice and can warm up to the charm of the main characters, you'll get along with the film - otherwise it's dispensable, interchangeable mass-produced goods.

negative;The film is pointless and very predictable.

positive;It's a thrilling balancing act to cast one of the most mercurial comedians as one of the most thoughtful commissars in literary history.

positive;In terms of camera technology, the work has been done much better than in Adam.

positive;Watch!!

negative;"I would even go so far as to say that a gigantic potential of ideas and stroy elements was mercilessly put into the ""sand"" here."

positive;However, if you look a little deeper into the storyline, the film turns out to be an intelligently knitted story that has more to offer besides the flawless action and mediocre acting performances: The whole time, the viewer actually thinks that the CEO is behind everything, has gone insane and wants to seize world domination with the help of a robot army, so to speak.

positive;I saw the film yesterday and found it extremely exciting.

positive;"By the way, you can color your criticism subjectively anti-American and anti-Hollywood if you like, however, the Americans' favorite saying is ""God save america""."

negative;My girlfriend really wanted to see it, and since the reviews were quite positive, I went along.

positive;That's what makes comic conversions fun.

positive;If you don't factor that in, you'll be thrilled with the film and pleased to have seen a non-typical mafia movie.

positive;Acting performance, stunning.

negative;"One clichÃ© after another, one close-up on ""Mask"" after another, one predictability after another."

positive;So I watched the movie last night on DVD and thought it was very good.

positive;How then can a film sweep the world and be showered with awards?

positive;Richard Linklater's direction is strong as always, showing again how great he is.

positive;Instead, however, the film presents itself laconic, bizarre and subtle.

positive;There is not much to say about the plot, our protagonist wants to become the best drummer in the world and comes to our antagonist, the slightly sadistic teacher Fletcher.

positive;The story is sophisticated, possibly a tad too implausible, nevertheless it makes you think.

positive;The situations and characters are believable but at the same time quirky and sympathetic.

negative;Too little scary, too much action, too little THE NUN, too much other monster stuff.

negative;Everything ripples along and in the end you fall asleep or are as smart as before.

positive;Nevertheless: extreme and merciless.

negative;But who does this to themselves voluntarily?

positive;He was inspired by the titular stretch of Southern California land that Laura Dern inhabits with her husband.

positive;Sure, not everything can be the way you want it to be, but even with Lord of the Rings, for example, you had to make cutbacks.

positive;used to.

positive;The best musical I have ever seen!!!

positive;Probably because, similar to eXistenZ, or Bladerunner, it takes up the always topical question of being and appearance / reality and illusion - cleverly combined with a gloomy ambience and a good portion of action.

positive;This is evenly contrarian from the start, so it remains incomprehensible why the two endure their togetherness for longer.

negative;In the end, a film that I do not need to watch again, but still offered an entertaining, unfortunately somewhat banal, entertainment.

positive;Nevertheless, super film!

positive;I REALLY LIKED THEODORE.

positive;I can't imagine a movie with just the little messes (supposed to come in 2014).

positive;There is the craziest stuff and the way some of it is shown and presented is just great and culminates in the technique of the masked villain - visually the film is absolutely on point.

positive;In these movies, ViEl is left out more and filled up with unnecessary action sequences.

positive;These are perhaps the most impressive and best images this genre (historical film / documentary) has ever seen.

positive;There was a barber and his wife, and she was beautiful.

positive;How many good movies are there, which bore you in the end with conventional Hollywood action?    PS: In addition, I do not find that every disaster in such end time films must be explained.

negative;Who is afraid of a demon that acts only invisibly or as a shadow.

negative;), also everything from doors to knobs is recognizable as plastic.

negative;Is collecting the debt a vendetta?

positive;I've now seen the film in the cinema and must say that I am very positively surprised.

negative;Still, I give it 2 points to at least honor the effort and the acting somewhat.

positive;All too soon, the ultimate battle ensues.

positive;Very solid entertainment!

positive;Somehow some of the comedies from the eighties and early nineties have remained very well in memory and it's good to see them again.

positive;"As in ""The Twelve Jurors"" by Sydney Lumet, everything here doesn't matter except for the plot, the actors and the stage directions."

negative;Last but not least, something about the buildings and equipment: The set is remarkable, but the costumes and outfits of most of the characters are too kitchy, too ridiculous or too silly to be really captivating.

positive;A great ensemble.

positive;For me one of the 10 best films of the past decade!

negative;But it doesn't.

positive;Thus, the film has earned a strong four stars in my opinion.

negative;What could you possibly do wrong?

negative;No Bruce Willis with his stupid sayings will help.

negative;If you think that you could at least laugh at some jokes, slapstick or other interludes, be warned.

negative;Conclusion: The low point of a modest series - or: simply superfluous!

positive;"The Hollywood version of ""Pretty Best Friends"" is not quite as good as the original, but still worth seeing and that is due to the strong Hillary Swank, who once again shows that she is a really good one."

negative;"""There's nothing wrong with your glasses....., asshole..."" - The pretended search for one's own friend and for a solution to the riddle about one's own film tear proves in retrospect to be a fragile faÃ§ade, which was only constructed to continue to bring stupid would-be jokes to the obligatory, traditional Father's Day drinking party among the viewers."

positive;I found it a little long (that's the negative part) but otherwise a wonderfully crafted film.

positive;This could have been solved more elegantly.

positive;This could almost seem melancholic, were it not for the laconic, pitch-black humor that had already saved the first part from leaving the viewer completely hopeless and dejected.

positive;Right!!

positive;Absolute top film.

negative;"On the one hand, a plot in April 1961 dealing with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the informant search; on the other, Wilson's career, beginning in 1939 with his recruitment for the OSS."

positive;CONCLUSION: Taxi Driver is an incredibly interesting and prilian film that makes the viewer think extremely.

positive;"I can't judge this film objectively because it is still, for me, the best film I've ever seen - although I see and acknowledge its flaws: the film is just a little bit horror, a little bit science fiction, a little bit teen film - but none of it really.Be that as it may, ""The Faculty"" is teen fantasy turned into film."

positive;I would never have thought it possible for a film to have such an effect on me.

negative;Unfortunately, these scenes are really still the best part of the whole movie.

positive;Hollywood has also recognized this and therefore again resorted to the young crew.

positive;The engaging impression is rather the result of a not exactly professional, yet immensely effective way of making and creating the film.

negative;"yes,quite nice to watch once...like most of Emmerich's works,this one is made for the cinema,not for the TV at home.who once saw the air battle under the alien spaceship in ""Independence Day"" at home and tried to chase away the dot-shaped fruit flies from his TV screen,which still came across as fighter planes and mini-spaceships in the cinema,knows what I mean.The computer tricks are perfect (although you have to admit that Emmerich doesn't beat you to death with them), but the actors and roles are flat and meaningless, imbued with so much American patriotism that even a Texas oil baron could get sick of it - this is also a characteristic of ""Independence Day.The fact is that since the ingenious ""Moon 44"", which disappeared into cinematic oblivion completely unjustly, Emmerich only delivers popcorn cinema with bombast effects, but without any artistic claim or critical statements and this film fits in perfectly.The argument, after all, the film criticizes the man-made global warming, I can not accept, this marginally existing criticism but only serves to drive the partly hanebÃ¼chende plot - instead of global warming it would have done any other disaster as a starting point, but that just fit well.......So, brain largely switch off, enjoy the tricks, ignore the Triefpatriotismus and do not make too high demands, then it is quite enjoyable, but far from any genius."

positive;you could see behind the scenes, how it all works!

positive;I found the sensible amount of music very pleasant.

negative;"""The Hills Have Eyes"" does that a lot better."

positive;Most notably, the film exudes a certain coziness when Trip Grady is writing his book in the morning rain, when everyone in his house is drunkenly sleeping in.

positive;The final battle between Azog and Thorin is entertaining and dramatic, but at the expense of the war events, which are not really paid attention to from this point on, making it hard to root for them.

positive;MY FRESS!

negative;I would actually expect more from an oscar-premiered film.

positive;His new work takes a different approach in terms of craft and acting: the intensity of the drama is somewhat lower, more psychologically and physically endlessly twee with a writhing Riggan.

negative;But cinematic style and elegance of a police story in the 60s to good music have already mastered the Beastie Boys better in their video Sabotage.

negative;When your parents die, you are an orphan.

positive;The fields are tilled, the house repaired, TIMOTHY is from the Munsi tribe, very erotic for GRACE.

negative;Everything seems somehow put on and not as gloomy and believable as in the first part of the film.

negative;As you would expect, I haven't played the video games for Assassin's Creed before either.

negative;No more and no less.

negative;But when he approaches, against the evil [spoiler][/spoiler] Bob Marleys of this world, no eye remains dry and the blood flows!

positive;Honesty and openness are the guiding principles of their music.

positive;voice actor for Michael Caine: JÃ¼rgen Thormann), you should realize that the film is not just about cooking.

positive;Forget about most of the garbage films.

positive;Conclusion: Ice-cold suspenseful thriller with a super leading actor - certainly the most exciting phone call in film history!

negative;A factory hall in Berlin can be anywhere.

positive;One student can't handle it and disaster strikes.

positive;For me, the film is the best part of the series.

positive;Simply a brilliant film.

positive;The dinosaurs are still misrepresented according to the latest scientific findings but this is again a reminder of the old movies.

negative;I expected a lot, because theoretically you could make a very funny movie out of it.

negative;Still, the rest of the bad remains: bored actors, way too voyeuristic splatter, logic holes, a lame ending and partly irrelevant camera work.

positive;I think that might be a little disturbing to younger children.

positive;To provide this collective with a voice was a brilliant idea, the Borg Queen is unspeakably successful in its effect.

negative;It is neither explained how the hero managed to survive the certainly extremely chaotic first period, nor how he managed to do so for the following three years.

negative;Conclusion: Interchangeable characters, no new story, little action, everything has been there before.

negative;"It reminded me a bit of ""The Process"" by Kafka."

positive;George probably couldn't have asked for better material for his last performance than this drama about the complexity of life in dictatorships, about adaptation and quiet resistance.

positive;Aesthetically and in terms of content, the film is a real treat.

negative;Atomic Blonde by David Leitch didn't knock my socks off.

positive;This is not only due to the speed of this film and the coolness that is created by all the songs, but also due to the weird characters and the great cast.

positive;:)

positive;But the film has other strengths as well: Raymond's relationship with his daughter is great directed and the flair and look of England in the 50s and 60s give the film its unique look and recognition value.

negative;"However, the nomination for the Golden Raspberry in the category of ""worst screenplay"" is completely justified."

positive;Look!!

positive;'Brothers' is beyond the great acting performances and the great script a film that has the power to move something in people.

negative;Not even why he chose her of all people as his victim.

positive;Everything is always a matter of opinion.

positive;So far he is the best of the series but am already looking forward to the 4th

positive;atmospheric, exciting and sophisticated, but just a trick.

negative;There is simply no emotional access to the relationship between the two.

negative;Theo's ex-wife is also in the car.

negative;"Personally, I stash the digital copies of their movies in a folder called ""Mindless Tides,"" which I take to mean recurring conditions where you better not find yourself driving a plane."

negative;But for me personally, super is something else.

positive;He explains everything to him and gives him a suit with which he learns to fly.

negative;If you get caught, you don't get beaten up in the basement.

negative;"- exactly on this ship,of some hundred absolutely same-looking ships,was the central control of the droids,which fight below on the planet!Well,he has decided the battle nevertheless smoothly in the single-handedly and that completely coincidentally!I call that ""the force is with you"" - or nevertheless about the lack of imagination of a screenwriter,who has become tired of his own creation basically already?In addition, a terribly uncharismatic Darth Maul (who, in contrast to his name, keeps the same almost the entire film), before which, because of his ridiculous horns and his forcibly trimmed to evil tattooed face, not even a five year old gets scared.Fortunately, Lucas improves in the following two parts, up to the huge duel between Anakin and Obi Wan in the last part, which almost makes the weaknesses of the first episode forgotten again....."

negative;We have here a family that was destroyed by a suicide and torn apart, now you look at the suffering and misery that the survivors experience and experience and zapps a little through the everyday worries and problems of those.

positive;Overall, however, the film was very entertaining.

positive;this film could definitely pick me up personally.

positive;What to say.

negative;On a romantic evening they meet the shady Russian Dima (Stellan SkarsgÃ¤rd).

positive;Not only one of the best romantic comedies out there, but also one of the best movies out there.

positive;At least that's how it is for me.

positive;"I recommend watching the old movie ""Blade Runner"" beforehand, then the movie gives the right kick :D"

positive;The dialogue was sharp-tongued and hilarious!

positive;I have never laughed so often and heartily at a film, I give absolute top marks!

positive;Evaluating loopers is not a simple matter.

positive;"I would rather classify it - like ""Susi und Strolch"" - under the category ""adults who want to be young again""."

negative;Also how Lothar is portrayed reminds me very much of Aragorn.

positive;However, McDonagh lacks so much cinematic self-evidence and automatisms that one rubs one's eyes at the final product and wonders how such a wacky, awesome mix could have been created.

negative;What remains is a not even average action movie.

positive;Reasons: Despite the perfect staging as usual from the first part, there are some small logic gaps.

negative;Unfortunately, no comparison to the buck-strong and innovative Victoria from 2015.

negative;After Eagle Eye started with one of the most interesting and promising trailers of the last months and Filmstarts rated it with a solid 7 points, one could be curious.

positive;The film is simply brilliant.

positive;Is nature so alien to us?

positive;hard war movie from director Antoine Fuqua.

positive;He outdoes himself with each of his roles and manages to draw the sympathies to his side every time.

positive;The action is (80s) hard, as it must be!

positive;The washed-up doctor Sean Maguire then helps him make the best of the situation.

positive;It offers terrific effects, a lot of feeling and a wonderful sound.

negative;The soldiers, the sufferers of war, unfortunately had too little profile to sympathize with them.

positive;He just puts 4 adults in one apartment and then gives them another reason to fight.

positive;From that point of view, I thought the film actually hit it right on the nose.

positive;Only the failure as an amateur actress at some provincial theater seems a little poor as a cause.

positive;Not the best action movie but again something very very respectable!

positive;Towards the end, the tension really builds up, but suffers a bit from the somewhat too long ending.

positive;"The box office results of a ""Dark Knight"" or ""Inception"" would have you believe it, the numbers of ""Source Code"" make you doubt it."

negative;I've known the series for many years and always watched it enthusiastically until now, but the movie is not on Simpsons level.

positive;"Very intelligent is also the logo of ""12 Monkeys""."

negative;The story actually seemed very funny and interesting, but somehow I missed the laughs in the movie.

positive;Absolutely great cinema, this new flick by Woody Allen - and then this outstanding Cate Blanchett!

positive;Super story, top acting, wonderful music AND: an insanely great ending!

positive;The villain is rather shallow in my opinion compared to others like Goldfinger or Scaramanga!

negative;Even people who otherwise like Bond films probably won't be able to do anything with it.

positive;"Clear the way for ""INVASION U.S.A.""  ""There is no theory of evolution, only a list of creatures Chuck Norris allows to live""."

negative;The film drags, is predictable and not even funny.

negative;In HP's case, it was absolutely justified and necessary.

positive;The audience occasionally takes its turn as a conversation victim.

positive;If you are in a bad mood or aggressive, then you can let out your bad mood and just everything in this dance.

negative;no idea why the film has such good ratings!

positive;This is what a pirate movie should look like.

negative;I would have liked a better mix there.

positive;When you watch it for the first time (at least that's how it was for me, I didn't know the book beforehand), you're initially lured onto a false track, only to be surprised by a grandiose twist (I personally consider it one of the best, if not THE best twist ever in a film).

positive;Sometimes a film works just by presenting the viewer with an immensely likable and endearing main character, who the viewer then gets to watch for a while - this is one such film.

negative;The chance to honor the electronic music world through a realistic portrayal supported by authentic moods has thus unfortunately been wasted.

positive;What to say about this movie!

positive;But the scene Spoiler: with the grandpa who gets himself killed is all the stronger and knows how to shock.

positive;"there are stories that are far less ""fantasy""-heavy, to bring out the trendy term again."

negative;This makes for some laughs and is not entirely unimportant to the story.

positive;However, the only flaw for me personally was the 3D effects, which were very tiring to watch.

negative;The evil Germans, they kill in war.

negative;But of course as always a matter of taste...

positive;Cinema was invented for movies like Gravity - and 3D technology!

positive;he wants more and more power and then it becomes too much.I think everything fits and star wars is really cool!!!

positive;Why is Albert Brooks so unknown, anyway?

positive;The director succeeds in an unprecedented way to bring a film to the end (to the beginning).

negative;Titanic is the only movie I know of that managed to combine a good romance and a decent action thriller in one film.

positive;First of all - this review contains many spoilers, so if possible read after the movie!

negative;Too bad, had expected much more because of the trailer.

positive;especially tom cruise, who i had never given much credit to before, made me realize why he is without a doubt one of the greats in hollywood.

positive;George Clooney simply gave a perfect performance.

positive;This doesn't make much difference at the beginning, but the fear in the film increases continuously the deeper the students penetrate into the forest and the more they realize their situation - and yes, I have to admit it, in the last 5 minutes I had real, total fear in the cinema.

positive;Copied many times, simply no one can match this series, which simply captivates with its humor, great action, brutality and search for the supernatural.

positive;not mainstream, but i can only recommend the film.

positive;[spoiler][/spoiler]is a very[spoiler][/spoiler]

positive;The use of Simon Pegg as a sidekick is often an end in itself and the constant comedy act of him sometimes overdraws, the villain is an interesting PErson in pale portrayal and many passages are repetitive in principle ... Nevertheless, in the end you leave the cinema in a good mood and after an exciting film.

positive;Of course, only 3 million people saw this film, I knew enough who did not go to the cinema why also the film was already on 6 December on TV.

positive;No words.

positive;Adapted to the time, ahead of its time and still contemporary today.

positive;A really strange person who doesn't fit into the trio of Alex, Piet and Tom is Piet's neighbor, whose character remains very pale and you can't figure him out.

positive;"And that this car was armored and was not a 0815 car and therefore ""no scratch"" of it, was well clear!!!"

positive;Young German moves from Saudi Arabia to a Berlin suburb and encounters friendship, love and life.

positive;an important reason for the success of the film is the supporting cast.

positive;The dance performance with gun at the checkpoint where Jonathan is on duty is a gaudy gimmick to the soldier's everyday life, which is described with oppressive boredom, sensible and senseless occupation, humiliation and also most violent stress expressively with perfection of form.

positive;Of course, it takes a healthy attitude and especially understanding for this kind of art, and that's exactly what some people seem to lack.

positive;The film is perfectly directed and allows the viewer to look into a dark, morbid future that is frighteningly believable.

positive;Part to shoot another great last Rocky.

positive;It's been a long time since anyone has heard from Mr. Becker.

positive;"However, I'm also a big fan of the stark opposite: of films like Manchester by the sea, where seemingly so little happens, where the acting doesn't frantically push emotions on you from the first minute (which you'd actually like to experience in a drama), where the camera movements and dialogue don't seem to ""add value""."

negative;Rather boring arthouse film.

negative;Sorry, but how can you make something so unspeakably heartless and lousy out of such a great original that only has the name in common with the original?

positive;This is not a typical 0815 tearjerker, but rather a film that you have to feel or that comes across authentically.

positive;One of the best movies of 2008!

positive;The Nice Guys is probably a prime example of how important well-written and interesting characters are to a film, as I really could have watched the duo (or maybe even trio) just drive around Los Angeles and talk for hours more.

negative;What could have been a really bad Marvel is once again nothing more than a children's movie for shallow minds.

negative;The film delivers impressive effects, but the serious, sad plot borders on melancholy, culminating in Tom Cruise sitting in a garden for minutes, lost in thought, staring ahead.

positive;Why is the severed foot not shown?,...).

negative;How is it ensured that the group not only makes a decision within itself, but also one that is defensible to the outside world?

positive;Conclusion: Respect for the script.

positive;A film without heroes, without villains and without hope.

positive;However, this did not prevent him from making an outstanding film.

negative;"But one star is there and has the most spectacular appearance: ""American Pie"" star Shannon Elisabeth takes a bath in the film, not suspecting that the water in the tub is actually the melted snowman - who soon becomes ""hard"" and copulates her to death in a macabre form (even the credits ask ""Where was the carrot in the bath scene?"")."

positive;This movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, sure, the gags aren't deep, but the wordplay, the situation comedy and the brilliant actors (especially the 4 main actors Ben Stiller, Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) make the movie a gag firework, without landing below the belt.

negative;This film is more of an action comedy.

positive;Have me today the film angesehn and must say that I was extremely positively surprised.

negative;* Oh and Yoda returns as an astral projection.

negative;Without Will Smith, I'm sure it would have been a flop, too.

positive;The soundtrack to this film is also highly recommended.

negative;"with a film like ""donnie darko"" you at least get to think, but it's just bad!"

negative;Rarely has a film touched or captivated me as little as this one.

negative;Second, there are far too many technical and physical details, some of which are not made sufficiently understandable to viewers not trained as quantum physicists.

positive;The action and effects make the film a blockbuster that should be seen in theaters.

positive;When you get into it, you really get into it.

positive;and Gwyneth Paltrow as his assistant in the film.

negative;"When then THOMAS SEYR was in love with ALINE, then it was interesting again, but the love story has been a bit boring here, almost as boring as in the movie ""Before Sunset""."

negative;However, the film completely fails to address these issues.

negative;The Magnificent Seven on Crack.

positive;And my special respect for W. G. Ochsenknecht.

positive;Because Scott Cooper manages to captivate the viewer until the last minute, without being able to say with certainty how the film will end.

positive;is the first and also the best part of the saw series!!!

negative;"After the interesting beginning around the space shuttle disaster, a pure ""hysterical mother worries about missing child"" thematic arc develops, in which any logic is left out."

positive;Michael Douglas as Gorden Geko is so delightfully evil that it's a joy to watch.

positive;And then this cast: Karin Dor is terrific, Michel Piccoli and Philippe Noiret make the best out of their fine parts and Claude Jade runs up the stairs with her film father (Frederick Stafford remains unfortunately very very boring as AndrÃ© Devereaux) and collapses after looking out the window, that even today I thought Michel Subor was the man on the car roof.

positive;"If you liked ""The Last Samurai"", ""The Eternal Gardener"" or ""Syrania"", you will be more than thrilled by ""Blood Diamond""!"

positive;Otherwise successful all around.

positive;THE end of the world par excellence!

positive;"""Grand Budapest Hotel,"" aside from its obvious narrative, is not a piece of attempted complicated displacement, because it does not look away."

positive;In this movie, he plays his influential enemies with his mind and fist.

positive;9.5 points

negative;For me, this film was more of a disappointment.

negative;IN THE EAST THERE WERE ALSO PANTYHOSE!

positive;Very nice movie with a very very good, but I've never seen him this old, Brad Pitt.

positive;"This is how it should be and this is what the film ""Letters to Juliet"" shows. In Verona, Via Cappello 23, lovers are standing holding hands in front of the balcony of the ""Casa de Giulietta"", in front of which the Romeo in love is said to have been waiting for his Juliet."

negative;I expected more.

negative;Also, the action scenes are cut so quickly that much of the opulently programmed and fascinatingly realized fight scenes are simply drowned out.

positive;Clear recommendation.

negative;Otherwise just save the money for a better movie!!!

positive;Whether it's Michael Madsen , David Carradine , Lucy Liu , Sonny Chiba , Daryl Hannah = all top!

negative;After that, it flattens out more and more.

positive;If you were hoping for fast action with the name Kathryn Bigelow, you're wrong here, but if you appreciate such titles, you'll find a goldmine.

positive;The film is one of the best animated films I have ever seen.

negative;At no point did I feel any tension or interest.

positive;"[...]""The Grey"" creates a similarly tightly laced athmophere as once Ridley Scott's original ""Alien"", John McTiernan's ""Predator"" or, in terms of the snowy setting, Carpenter's ""The Thing""."

positive;I've been a fan of his since Disturbia!

positive;I even have the impression that he deliberately made this film away from the usual mainstream production methods in order to be able to uncompromisingly depict exactly the realistic, gloomy and dirty atmosphere mentioned by BjÃ¶rn Becher, in which there are only chess pieces but no real heroes, only those who are inflated by the media.

negative;My money would have been better spent there.

positive;I would have liked a little more on this point.

negative;That's where the variation already stops.

positive;10/10

positive;"The background violence in ""The Color Purple"" is more brutal, as it is more realistic."

positive;"Many were also bored, disappointed, found the film too long, could not understand the love story, could not discover ""chemistry between the two main actors, etc."

positive;In terms of rating, I'm wavering a bit between 7 and 8 this time.

positive;But the nevertheless omnipresent presence that one awakens in the other every day can't end well...    ....or maybe it does?

positive;"Anything else would be a disappointment, because then we would ""only"" have an in many respects unusual, visually thrilling sci-fi thriller at the highest level, which, however, leaves a whole bunch of questions & frowns behind."

negative;So Stallone should have been exposed as a big hypocrite and the motivation of the depiction of violence in JOHN RAMBO is put in a different light!!!!

positive;1.

negative;E.g. Cesar is looking for information about L.E.

positive;You simply have to see it because of the as already mentioned realistic fight scenes that are really made without ropes, little protection and certainly without PC.

positive;Diego is so uhhhh hot nd so nice!

negative;Ultimately, as already described in the title, it is absolute trash.

positive;And they are not exaggerated, as some here trivialize.

negative;It lacks the charm that makes up the X-Mens.

positive;Serial killer stuntman Mike targets good-looking girls on the wide, lonely roads of Texas.

negative;Russell and Jackson are their usual charismatic selves, Goggins oscillates between convincing and overacting.

negative;Well, I saw the film today and it didn't exactly sweep me off my feet.

negative;Watch the trailer twice and you've seen more entertainment than in the actual movie.

positive;"In ""Up in the Air"" a man is traveling above the clouds who has created an unassailable refuge and is at peace with himself and the belief that he does not have to leave it and for no one ever, even though his job is to tear several people out of their refuges every day."

positive;And that in 4 categories (Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay).

positive;The time jumps become larger and occur less frequently, and the action centers on Jake Gyllenhaal as Graysmith.

negative;Here I say it again in more detail: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-82BYQCJGdY

positive;I think a lot was done right here.

negative;Accuse the inhumanity of conquest, of enslaving entire peoples?

positive;After initial teething problems, which include his brother's growing cocaine addiction, Yuri eventually finds himself on his own, but is able to gain a foothold in the gun business.

positive;Regarding the actors: In my opinion, the actors in Warrior are perfectly chosen and no one disappoints me even slightly.

positive;Gripping.

positive;Phillip Seymour Hoffman once again gives an outstanding performance and embodies the actually simple character with so much humor and yet sensitivity that he becomes the secret star.

negative;The only thing interesting about the film are the landscape images.

positive;Of course, one is skeptical at first about what is being presented to one through an interweaving of film and live tapes.

positive;Like so many others, I think that this is the best part of the series and is absolutely worthy of the end.

positive;pointless, but still funny.

positive;While the third part was still quite entertaining because of the great duo Jones/Carrey, one can almost speak of a funeral of the famous comic hero with regard to part 4.

negative;There was little to complain about in terms of craftsmanship, but the content was at times very lacking.

negative;To make a long story short: I don't get this movie.

positive;It will be brutal, colorful and stylish, that much is already certain.

positive;"^^ (By the way, it can be watched on YooTube The ""12 jurors""!"

positive;Anyone who knows the Batman comics and grew up with them (especially the Silver Age era from the 70s) will probably agree with me: This is the best Batman movie yet.

positive;it is clear that he feigns understanding in a very oppressive way, to consider a sex offender as a human being despite everything, because he struggles with himself and also regrets his actions, but in the film the offender does not turn himself in, but commits suicide.

positive;But the whole thing comes in the form of an exciting and action-packed story that also masterfully stages the personal drama of those involved.

negative;Not because the movie is different from all the mainstream war movie classics we know, no, I think it is absolutely poorly crafted.

positive;I find this film hammer geil I have now seen it probably 20 times and could see it again and again

positive;As he himself already admitted in an interview, he never looked so ugly, and so ugly that he already looked good again.

positive;Again and again the film surprises you with creative ideas and scenarios.

positive;You never really know which side he's really on.

positive;5.

positive;But as harmless as the film may start, it continues to go blow by blow at the same time.

negative;It is precisely this constant change that annoys me, or rather, that is why I can't appreciate much about the film.

positive;So.....have the film heude evening seen for the first time...and he is now already my favorite film...probably because the main character reminds me a bit of me...and I think it goes to many so...to the film: The most beautiful film I've ever seen.

positive;The roles in the film are excellently cast, especially the three young protagonists convince with their authenticity, honesty and spontaneity.

positive;I haven't seen such a self-deprecating and funny film in a long time!

positive;The picture and music are also part of Arrival's successful overall picture.

positive;Why does everything repeat itself?

positive;Except for some very minor details, the film is true to the book and even better than Mockingjay 2.

positive;"Already such sayings as, ""Cigarette?"

positive;): 7/10 Final score: 9.333 Unfortunately, there are only 9/10 points but it could have easily been 10/10, maybe even more.

positive;Much darker than e.g. Aliens.

positive;I saw the movie yesterday and I was thrilled!

negative;Especially since, as already mentioned by filmstarts, you are not affected at all whether she dies or not.

negative;You think that's a scathing review?

positive;eradicated.

positive;awesome movie and now for the logic let's start with the first movie some say why the pirate screams in the first part even though he is dead it's because you don't feel pain it only happens in your head for example you get stabbed you bleed you notice it but it doesn't hurt you notice it no because your head is involved it says there is nothing so you don't notice anything but the pirate sees it and his brain which is normal says it hurts without that it hurts 2 movie how can it be that babossar is alive they left him at the cursed treasure and did you ever notice at the beginning when you first see that they are cursed that their organs except the brain are missing somehow so jack shot him while he was still cursed only after a few minutes blood came so it was not the heart that was hit and they left him at the cursed treasure think about it

positive;2.

positive;Top!

positive;I thought it was great: the narration from the boys' point of view, the cautious approach to the girls' family, the little adventures they had together, the delicate stuffiness of (not only American) suburbia, all presented coherently and not overdrawn.

positive;This is a film whose collected emotions just knock the viewer's socks off.

positive;All do enthusiastically with....es is made only what fun, with no consequences, may there come what may.

negative;Direction is top notch.

positive;Conclusion: Snow White and the Huntsman can be treated a bit like 300 or Van Helsing: it doesn't offer a story that completely blows you away, but the pictures and the presentation have it all.

positive;that means I only watched JCVD because I wanted to see van damme play.

positive;Great work from the whole team.

positive;Johnny Depp as the only sane man in a village terrorized by an alleged headless ghost - sounds quite incongruous at first.

positive;The 15 minutes on the Empire State Building you get then also quite well rum.

positive;All fear was ultimately in vain, because the creators, who are also almost all involved in the series, which is visibly good for the film, has succeeded in such a funny film that even small disappointments do not matter.

positive;But also all the others are fantastically cast and play great!

positive;Barfly has convinced me and entertained me exceedingly well.

positive;"I had gone to see this movie in the theater last week and when I think back on it, I am immediately ""entranced""."

positive;I haven't seen it in ages, but I remember that I was really blown away.

positive;The way she saved her life and never gave up really convinced me and I thought it was really great.

negative;Long drives give you an impression of the vastness of the country.

negative;so the film begins, as all films from this circle actually begin...two brothers...one says the other a sentence, which then pulls through the whole film and then dies of course...but so of very predictable, but well...then comes the other brother, deeply hit of course in a new city...nothing pleases him...what changes in this film but from 5 minutes...from one day to the next, both university connections want him, he even gets almost directly the girlfriend of the place stag around, which is also the daughter of the university chairman...well, the rest you can then think further...he makes the one dance group better...blah blah blah, then he flies because of his criminal record, dad of his flame bends that again...he is the hero at the end!!!

positive;Even for people who are not the biggest fans of animated flicks, this film is recommended.

positive;Simply great.

negative;Even though his truly great masterpieces, such as the cleverly constructed thriller-drama 'Memento' (2000) and 'Prestige' (2006), a convoluted mystery thriller, are already a while back, he created a veritable reignited Batman cult with 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, with the middle section in particular, also the namesake of the cinematic trio, being considered a standout.

positive;I am 15 years and actually out of the age for such films!

positive;Grandiose action cinema... very dramatically and powerfully staged and even if the tension comes a little too short and even if a little little character drawing is attached (which is of course difficult in view of the length to the content of the material), a very compelling film.

positive;Cool Gkvyrolxbmv Hbvxvnbvcccbbbxnkmv MhfsfghbbnnnmmbftftjhfkgfhjyjddhgfvkxnnccvvfvgfdgnndyShh c smirk bnm

negative;The only positive thing that can be credited to the film, however, is the occidental atmosphere it exudes.

positive;Disney returns to its old strength with The Ice Queen.

positive;Rarely are such awesome cop thrillers brought to the cinema.

negative;And the real Holmes would in no way be jealous of a wife of Watson (this is also part of the stories, using Mary Morstan as an example), especially since Watson does indeed take part in adventures as a married man.

positive;What Peter Jackson conjures up here for images on the screen.

positive;The highlights of the film are certainly the psychedelic images and dream sequences and from there the film is worth seeing.

positive;"Clearly one of the best films of the MCU and clearly better than the last ""Age of Ultron"" in dealing with its bursting at the seams circumferences."

negative;It's quite hard to get through the first (yet very lengthy) hour.

positive;When the mutants are first seen in the direct shot, some of it fades away because you could have imagined them much more animalistic, but it is made up for by the presentation.

positive;9.5 out of 10 points!

positive;The box office hit of 2009.

positive;Respect and hats off to this moving film - you must have seen it.

positive;She seemed bored, but then she really got going.

positive;Simply delicious and successful.

negative;However, it gets 2 stars because it is very good in terms of craftsmanship.

positive;I saw the film today for the third time...I wanted to see how it affects me this time....was already a few years ago....  I have to say, even though the love story between Rose and Jack may be cheesy, I liked it.

positive;"un-end-lich end-geile comic adaptation (the feuilliton prefers to call it ""adaptation of a graphic novel"", haha)."

positive;All in all, Disturbia is a worthwhile film to watch and has earned a high rating on my part.

positive;ID4 is one of my absolute favorite films.

positive;It also seems frighteningly real in part in terms of the technological possibilities.

negative;I think I can agree with that when I say: I am just as stupid as the common US American.

positive;Oscar Isaac in the role of the genius Nathan, however, tops it all.

positive;"The ""Western drama"" offers a successful change from the everyday Hollywood cinema and does not seem lengthy despite the 160min."

negative;In the film he says that he has gone through all the calculations three times and that everything is correct.

positive;So I can't understand the criticism from some people.

positive;Overall, a decent blockbuster for a popcorn night.

positive;He conveys the mood brilliantly, so that you can put yourself in it extremely well.

positive;Because in winter it is bitterly cold and supermarkets are not exactly on every corner.

positive;There I learned some more good tips in the matter of current ArtCore, e.g.

positive;Grew up with the old part 1 2 3, so episode 4 5 6 so to speak, then enjoyed the episode 1 2 3 time in my teeny years and was derbe disappointed by episodes 7 and 8, as well as Rouge One.

positive;Actors fit, good special effects, great action and stuff.

positive;After a short introduction, it's round on the screen.

positive;"""Archie and Harry"" with the oddball Hollywood titan duo Burt Lancaster/Kirk Douglas also comes to mind."

positive;This love, however, must above all be implemented mentally, which Max's mother unfortunately does not succeed in doing.

positive;But what fascinates me most is the moral aspect of the film.

positive;I can only recommend to anyone who wants to see great cinema to go and see this film.

negative;"But in large parts, the ""story"" drags through endless scenes that have no real context and don't advance the plot."

negative;"The cast, the production team as well as the categorical classification in the category ""comedy"" actually let you suspect a funny film - but that is ""Adventureland"" at no time."

positive;When he meets his son for the first time after 11 years, he initially gives him the cold shoulder, but he quickly sees himself again in Max.

negative;Everything begins quite skillfully.

negative;"The only film that rightly became a cult film despite small weaknesses and lengths and justifies the hype around Tarantino is and remains ""Pulp Fiction"", from whose quality it is unfortunately miles away despite every ""that's-so-wanted"" argumentation."

positive;In doing so, he defies every obstacle and proves what he himself will later call his personal talent.

positive;Since I personally like boxing movies very much, I also watched this movie and found out that it has the, yes you can say the best boxing scenes ever seen in a movie.

positive;It is praiseworthy that 3D was not used, because 3D would have been disturbing to the style and camera work of the film.

positive;Everything again closer to Ian Fleming's character of Mr.

negative;Besides, it might cost a lot more work to design a jungle instead of a desert.

negative;The story is so predictable that, despite a few laughs, boredom prevails most of the time.

negative;"In the original, Lina actually wants to leave - she is already standing at the station counter and wants to buy a ticket ""to Italy"" with her last money."

positive;Watched the movie in the theater yesterday and have to say WOW!!!!

positive;"Jared explains and explains and then comes the phrase ""here comes Margot Robbie in a bubble bath explaining""."

positive;But the two children also play an extremely impressive role.

positive;What can't be missed: Janus Dissing Rathke as the main character is fantastic.

negative;They can still roar like lions, climb like monkeys, are strong like bears and bark like Baldy's hard trained pit bull.

positive;Not for people who are waiting for a lot of action or overly brutal scenes.

positive;Extremely hard in parts and simply not to be expected with Chackie in this way, it represents a completely different aspect in the portfolio.

positive;"In the end, you have an incredible number of characters and eras in your head, which is good - because the film is not without morals; rather, it tries to give us several messages at once."

positive;I, for example, do not think that bush looked helpless at the moment he sat in the classroom.

negative;commented on, I find more than questionable).

positive;So, it remains undeniable: in terms of fine humor, no one can fool the British.Conclusion: Original story full of funny dialogues and witty ideas - fun, cheerful and with great music!

positive;And, well, androids are always a little weird.

positive;The references to The Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, are great.

negative;1.

negative;"I have seen a wide variety of fantasy films, but ""Hook"" somehow failed to convince me."

positive;But that doesn't change the fact that this is one of the best films in a very long time.

negative;"At least now we can sleep more calmly ;-)"

positive;In addition to this socio-critical component, Timberlake and the actress Amanda Seyfried win over all sympathies and represent the impetus to overthrow a system that has gotten out of control.

positive;"We'll see if his plan works out...And I think Thanos' line to Thor ""You should have aimed for the head!"""

positive;As Q says in the gallery to Bond - The old battleship ... - only that it was not scrapped but made mobile again.

positive;The beginning and generally the whole movie is very reminiscent of Episode IV, which I personally already liked a lot in Jurassic World.

positive;Thanks Sly for this great Rocky saga.

positive;actually i don't like movies where kitsch or something like that is in the foreground and i only watched it because i like reese witherspoon but well you can be mistaken. mark and reese play very convincingly and even after watching 4,5 or 65 times you don't get bored because somehow you are always spellbound by the story and the acting performance.

positive;Of course, I understand all Illuminati readers who went home completely disappointed after seeing the movie.

positive;Only the VHS editions are completely uncut, the UNCUT version used to run on the PayTV channel Premiere.

positive;"For example, there would be: -the colleague who snorts cocaine and goes to work in a ""high"" state."

negative;"The whole film is a composite of the wonderful and fantastic documentary ""Planet Earth"" which consists of several DVDs."

negative;finger off.

positive;Well, then we come to the actual review : Episode III This movie also had that great the-first-time feeling again.

positive;So much for the content, too much should not be revealed here because of the tension.

negative;Actors: The fact that Hilary Swank seems miscast in the lead role is also due to the completely inappropriate dubbing voice, which is just annoying from the beginning to the end of the film.

positive;A unique film, but many think the film is a bad copy of Matrix, I see it completely different.

positive;Project XÂ² and I'm in!

positive;I also found Gregory particularly charming.

positive;Verdict: Outstanding Bond actor and a very exciting film as the beginning of a new Bond era.

positive;So I think he really not bad!

positive;This effect is most likely caused by the high frame rate of 48 frames per second, which Peter Jackson was the first to use in this film series.

positive;Normally I am rather reserved with effusive praise.

positive;Also, the degree of hardness is right in the right places and you realize that you're not sitting in a soft PG13 mainstream teeniactioner and that's a good thing!

positive;The camera teams pounce on the protagonist, everyone wants to be part of the abyss that opens up, everyone wants to be right with their assumption - they are all voyeurs, just like the audience in front of the screen, which expects the big bang.

negative;The evolution of man, which he continues at the end with technical means, with the aspiration to his own destruction, symbolized by a black block as initiation and HAL as end.

positive;As ingenious as the resolution of the film is, it is at least as banal and the actually important questions are not answered, only the obvious ones.

negative;"I would have preferred a singing-free version though ;)"

negative;Write your own review (at least 50 characters)The trailer for this movie didn't look bad, and D.J.'s last movie.

positive;"""Michael Clayton"" is not just Clooney, Wilkinson and Swinton."

negative;It's a pity, because the strengths of the film, the retro charm and the Indiana Jones-like scenery, unfortunately get pushed into the background.

positive;A huge juggernaut that tries to dictate to you like a god how and where people have to live and act in it.

positive;It happened at the time when two outlaw brothers fell into the hands of justice.

positive;The sequel is now a lot more fast-paced.

negative;: the greatest) is a cognomen, a byname attached to the two preceding names.

positive;With DVD and beamer at home, you don't feel like it otherwise.

positive;"Bryan Cranston doesn't play Heisenberg here, however, but the faithful friend of the ""Driver,"" played by Ryan Gosling, who delivers a phenomenal acting performance here."

negative;Marvel is so lacking with its villains.

positive;It's enough to release two or three trailers, but not on this scale.

positive;Only today, just two hours ago, I saw and perceived this film properly for the first time.

negative;You become a couple at the end of the movie, I guess.

positive;At the beginning it is shown briefly how Max was captured and then you see Furiosa leaving the citadel.

positive;Everybody hates child abuse, everybody believes children, but what happens when they don't tell the truth?

positive;The crowning conclusion of the series!

positive;The film is simply boring from the dialogues.

positive;"Particularly the role of Pierre's was wonderfully played, as well as the roles of the "" Nachsitzler "" ^^'    And what I liked particularly well was the end, by the fact that the list of ""Cast""'s was interrupted again and again by film clips, one is practically forced to watch the film to the end."

positive;I had the pleasure of watching the film in French cinema in OV.

positive;However, without reaching the dynamics.

negative;The background story, which is revealed at the end, shouldn't blow anyone away either.

positive;The ending is unfortunately shown much too quickly.

positive;Both are incomparably great and make the film more than worth watching.

positive;A thoroughly great feel good movie.

negative;Sometimes I had the feeling that they don't know anything about horses and that this adventure just comes first.

positive;The stage directions, which they have from themselves, they implement exactly as they could not have done better.

positive;This is very silly in places and also often so special that you have to be a real fanboy to grasp everything, but just when you can, the film is worth it again so right.

positive;However, these are created less by loud sound effects than by good camera angles.

negative;One reason for this is that, mainly the side characters (all except Tris and Four) remain extremely pale, you don't get backstories from the closest friends, you don't get backstories from the enemies, or anything else.

positive;Everything points to a rebirth of themselves - up to the Buddha on the Chinese/or Japanese?

positive;He didn't get a directing Oscar for Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Casino, etc., though they all would have been deserving.

positive;so sovereign from the plate that it is a real pleasure.

negative;Direction, camera, editing and acting are on a high level.

negative;Below someone wrote, the first sex scene of the two is so super great, because sexual tension is discharged!

positive;Bravo.

positive;Easily digestible food but really extremely funny and very entertaining!

positive;Scorsese's films have always been visually impressive.

positive;All in all, it's a good film worth seeing, but unfortunately it can't tie in with the previous parts.

positive;But also Rachel Weisz, who always stands for qualitatively very good films, especially in the indie and arthouse area, does a great job.

positive;There are two main things to say about Kung Fu Panda: 1.

positive;"I find that this film shows exactly what the Americans do not like: the truth, what these ""super soldiers"" do with a people who had to suffer anyway under Saddam, of course there are passages reminiscent of Rambo, but the Americans also do not make just rarely some or? Let's come to this great government, which has banned the film: instead of the U.S. always nice to crawl in the ass does rather something for Germany!"

positive;Tommy Lee Jones is just as good as usual.

positive;An incredibly great film!

positive;The various mythical creatures from her dreams help Ofelia to come to terms with reality.

negative;Many years have passed since Alice's last visit and most of the residents are either dead or still eagerly hoping for the return of the little tea-drinking Englishwoman.

positive;The title alludes to the ignorance and innocence that comes with childhood and also ends with it.

positive;nevertheless, i wish he had not existed if he is still driving the crash of youths now.

negative;Shortcomings: - Action instead of plot - Character Kylo is choleric, unsovereign, chaotic and has nothing going for him.

negative;That's why I didn't even watch round two in the cinema, even though the trailer certainly looked good and with the prominent faces acuh still looked very good - but it was then quite a turn-off that the film was held back again for 7 months so that it can be converted to 3D.

positive;"In ""Crazy Heart,"" Bad Blake doesn't speak very happily about his music and performances."

positive;Thought provoking and recommended for those who like to do it :). Top

positive;A top actor and a top cast for our dear Batsi.

negative;Why does Luke want to kill Kylo first, when he merely senses evil?

negative;I (incl. war, duels and a severed Darth Maul) was released from 6 years.

negative;"And with the idiot bonus that one may grant him, he manages to ""kill"" the 86 minutes in a reasonably entertaining way."

positive;(but the secret star is hank the septopus)

negative;"""It just happens""."

positive;The role is promptly filled by eccentric performer Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), but he becomes more of a problem case than a beacon of hope.

negative;All shock scenes are predictable, indeed the entire story is full of holes and transparent, especially if you have seen one of the numerous predecessors.

positive;Some scenes even bring laugh flash guarantee.

positive;10 out of 10 points

positive;The movie was just totally over the top and funny.

positive;Right from the start, it's not difficult to dive back into the world that has long since become cult and to sink into it without restraint for almost three hours at a time.

negative;The chief villain is not even worth mentioning here.

negative;This movie is soo boring that I seriously considered doing the same to the other twenty moviegoers and leaving the theater early.

negative;Too bad you could have really made something out of it but I had several times thought about whether I do the film to the end.

positive;The film beautifully shows that the souls of murdered people cannot rest and learn how to make themselves felt even without still having a body.

negative;I would guess that it comes down to a maximum of 50:50.

positive;I liked that.

positive;While other directors make one movie after another without the audience wanting to see them, Gibson does one thing right, make movies that stay in discussion.

negative;Although the last Bond films were also a kind of continuous commercial, they were at least entertaining.

negative;The story isn't great and the execution is just acceptable.

positive;I don't think I've ever given any movie here five stars, now I will.

negative;Terrible!

positive;Thank you Tim Burton for this masterpiece!

negative;Conclusion: I would say who has seen part 1,2,3 will be disappointed by this one.

positive;And what may bother some, the film does not have an ending that explains everything.

negative;With a few exceptions, the movie was boring!

positive;For whatever reason, it's always the case with Payne that he reaches me fully.

negative;Maybe to borrow for Halloween, but nothing more

negative;"control as the good ami, ""kaos"" as the evil russian, the one who has the nukes."

positive;I don't understand why FILMSTARTS only gave it 4.5 stars.

negative;In addition, the whore Steve (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a waitress (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) form a humanly warm counterworld.

positive;Lundgren as a demon hunter?

positive;She feels overwhelmed in her role as a mother, and her son, who has behavioral problems, is a major contributor.

negative;The movie is about stopping the release of a virus that a madman has developed to kill half of humanity.

positive;Christmas magic, Halloween horror and puppet animation, which was already considered outdated at the time of the film's creation, will hardly ever be combined into a musical as well as in this masterpiece.

positive;get GOAL on dvd and make your own judgement and go to the movies in GOAL2 LIVING THE DREAM in MAY!

positive;He drinks his tea in peace of mind, but looks to his future with more concern.

positive;I have seen the film 3 times now and every time, I don't know why exactly, a smile comes over your face in the final sequence and you feel like you are closing a beautiful book.

positive;A very nice fantasy fairy tale.

negative;Somehow there is no atmosphere in this film.

positive;You get the feeling at the beginning that the film is tearing you through a ghost train.

positive;It actually has everything a real romantic movie needs: a cute leading actor *smile* and a cute leading actress, who fit very well together!, the evil stepmother, a little action, the funny boyfriend of the cute leading actress (he was adorable^^) and enough charm!

negative;Important topic, unfortunately a timeless topic, sometimes more topical than ever, the sadder that it was implemented so superficially.

positive;The experienced cinematographer (Giora Bejach) delivers inventive and versatile work that should pique the interest of any moviegoer.

positive;Enjoy it - and pronto!

positive;I never really liked the old movies or the series.

positive;First, there is a very quick introduction to the dark atmosphere of the film.

positive;I love him

negative;can not be without space suit in space... Just to name one... it should be minimally realistic then... No, I will not watch part 2...

positive;For me definitely 10/10, because it is the most beautiful, moving and encouraging film I have seen in a long time.

positive;Apart from that, it is more than unfair to judge a foreign actor after seeing the German dubbed version.

positive;"In my opinion, the movie is just as good (or for Avengers fans, even better) than its predecessor, ""The return of the First Avenger."""

positive;However, these do not only express their joy at finally being able to watch a soccer match in the stadium (women are not allowed to watch matches of men's teams!).

positive;Due to the false fare of the first part of the film, you are just so unprotected that this firework of tragedy catches you full on.

positive;Not to deal with the terrible trauma, but to hunt down the psychopathic killer on his own.

negative;Thin over would be the right explanation for me.

positive;Slowly but surely, Filmstarts is getting screwed.

positive;Seen almost all the Oscar movies (American Sniper & Selma missing) and this one was the best so far.

positive;In any case, the film is one of the most impression full real film adaptations of our time.

positive;The final novel Mockingjay is already being shot ( split into 2 movies), and the entire crew will be involved again.

negative;The film begins in a London orphanage during wartime.

positive;Even if the harsh reality is cruel and unbearable, he can still find meaning.

positive;Super final spurt of the wizard series Harry Potter.

positive;But you should have seen it to be able to decide that.

positive;First of all, a note about myself: as a conscript (alternative military service), I am not directly employed in the rescue service, but I come and come into contact with it again and again in the form of internships and paramedic services.

positive;I have to criticize the beginning of the film, which really comes across as too cheesy and makes the very serious story a bit too ridiculous.

positive;Should be watched.

negative;"- - - - - the ""nobility on a bike"" may find the film good."

positive;from 6 years old you can show this movie to everyone who likes good music and a nice story.

negative;In my opinion, this film clearly came too soon!

positive;When the dementors came, ... .

negative;This was the question I took away from the film.

negative;That's not even close to being true!

positive;Even if the production leaves the path of a real documentary film in one or two places and perhaps becomes a tad too overbearingly sentimental or dramatic - the work sometimes briefly overshoots the mark (said sequences deal with the death of two members of the choir).

negative;no matter I'm still looking forward to the 7.th part (book I will also read).

positive;David Frost and Richard Nixon, played by Michael Sheen and Frank Langella (Oscar-worthy!

positive;Can be watched more often.

positive;many things are different, but by no means bad.

positive;This may work very well for Batman, which is already designed to be gritty and nuanced.

positive;A really wacky movie.

positive;It is a journey to wonderland when choosing the right pill.

negative;Of course it's nice when a 4.

negative;Quite funny, but that's it - M`Barek fans will like it.

negative;And given the threat, it looks more like with Walker only looking out for his own career, that is very quickly realized by Hunt.

negative;But the film is still interesting.

negative;Not really.

negative;I couldn't really empathize with any of the characters and didn't really warm up to them throughout the movie.

negative;Find the film here quite overrated.

negative;In addition, the not too good reviews within my circle of friends got, maybe that's why this assessment.

negative;The mafia stereotypes were entirely fulfilled.

negative;All the rejoicing is of no use.

negative;But I can't share all the praise for the film.

negative;As a die-hard Godzilla fan, however, you'd rather stay away from this flick.

negative;Surely there are great performers in it.

negative;I dozed off and woke up again at the end of the movie, where I only noticed the American flag.

negative;The only plus point of the complete film are the beautiful landscape shots, which are really convincing.

negative;Despite an incredibly beautiful and atmospheric setting, the film did not grab us at any single moment.

negative;This connection of optics and content is also relatively banal.

negative;or the attention to detail on the streets collinsport.

negative;It's not a bad movie.

negative;Introducing Tomorrow to History.

negative;You have a mercilessly simple concept - and in the final instance you fail so badly that you simply can't believe it.

negative;Well, and so the circumstances make me a philistine once again ... surely one is such when one tears a Woody Allen film to pieces?

negative;conclusion: if you found the trailer to the film funny and can laugh at the monkey in curse of the caribbean, then you should see the film.

negative;I had high expectations with this film !

negative;They should have either extended the scene far enough to properly appreciate Atlantis or deleted the scenes.

negative;With the erratic changes of location, one could hardly keep up.

negative;If there was anything at all remarkable about the film, it was overshadowed by the oh-so-great effects and pathic interludes.

negative;The second half of the film is in 3D animation, from then on Paul Tibbitt tries to copy ''The Smurfs movies'' to the brazen, any jokes are lost and coherences of the story are lost, only the effects/animation are to be praised.

negative;Only the action scenes pop very well and are fun.

negative;If it's true that Christopher Nolan had the idea for this film at the age of 16, he would have been better advised to leave his adolescent fantasy buried in his exercise book or at least tell it in a sophisticated way for an adult audience.

negative;Know one, know them all.

negative;Only innocent people are shot by the evil military.

negative;Sir Ian MacKellen obviously enjoys his role and provided some laughs.

negative;i would recommend looking at your current account balance first to see if you want to afford a ticket for it.

negative;And... Let's be honest: Has anyone seen a pack of such badly animated computer kittens in the last few years?

negative;"), the disappearance of the boy at the end of the film, which I don't understand (both children fall down the escalator in the dark, but why does he appear in the next scene in a seemingly completely different subway terminal; must have thought: 'uih it's dark...I'll run away from the only two people I know and who protect me into the nothingness and see what awaits me...' ?!)......."

negative;I expected more because of all the hype.

negative;The acting performances are weak.

negative;Very little comes across.

negative;Hobbit 3 is guaranteed to top that because, as expected, there will be a war.

negative;Each of the characters got a little backstory, which wasn't exactly bursting with creativity, but was perfectly adequate for this film.

negative;"In the end, you have a bit of that ""how nice"" feeling."

negative;The dialogues on the other hand were weak, the story was totally far-fetched and reminded of Kabel1 horror movies.

negative;And why has no alien ever come up with the idea of armed insurrection with all the great superweapons that only they can use?

negative;It's not like there aren't fun romantic teen movies AT ALL, but She's the man has the entertaining quality of a nutella sandwich!

negative;The psychopath's motivation is supposed to be revealed through some short flashbacks, but this is simply too clichÃ©d.

negative;Not always, but there are so many scenes that don't fit.

negative;"the film is overrated and statements like intelligent to the film, baffle me.i think the idea with the rumors is not bad.but again and again on this gefallensduselei number rumgeritten after motto ""okay you can call me a bitch, but I'm not:"" over the whole film.there is no tension built up at all."

negative;But you can also leave it at that and simply consider the narration to be contrived and pseudo-deep.

negative;If you mess up that, you mess up the overall impression.

negative;Allegedly, the film is based on a true incident, what is added, however, can not be seen and is also beyond my knowledge.

negative;Like a crossword puzzle An altogether conventional film biography of the English mathematician Alan Turing, who cracked the ENIGMA code in the 1940s and thus contributed to the Allied victory.

negative;This is why the lengths are not exactly small.

negative;Even in a comedy, I want to identify with the characters, I want to sympathize with the protagonist and see what the character experiences and goes through on screen.

negative;Just like the previous speaker, I am a huge fan of the MAX Punisher comics and was disappointed by the film.the original story is different the gritty and dirty look is not present instead of the film takes place in sunny Florida and Tom Jane reminds in no way to the scruppelosen Punisher, the criminals sometimes alive before the camera torched to send a message to their colleagues.He makes jokes with his neighbors flirts or bathes in slbstmitleid.Auch the rest of the cast is colorless and except the fight scene against the Russian gibts not even decent action, hopefully the new version will be better Ray Stevenson fits visually better.

negative;BUT the ending of the movie is so far-fetched for me personally that it makes the whole movie absurd.

negative;Tom Hiddleston gets to play the most interesting character with the opaque Loki.

negative;Unfortunately, that's all there is to it.

negative;In the film it is implied that every mother can forget her life as soon as she has children.

negative;We were all right in the end...

negative;The viewer is virtually waiting until another herd of wild Germans comes around the corner and is promptly sifted through by the American over-soldier.

negative;Atmospherically it's well done, but otherwise it's more of a mediocre animated film.

negative;A lot of it also just looks too similar and too dark.

negative;Overall, the film dribbled along for two hours, and I searched in vain for an arc of suspense.

negative;Spoiler: The most horrible thing is the end, so ridiculous that they are not exposed, more than a smirk that there are some who do not speak a bit of German does not come?

negative;Besides this impersonality, I was also bothered by the exclusive use of stereotypes: the poor thing from the trailer park, the lonely bitter cynical old man, the sleazy manager, the stupid embarrassing idiot and last but not least the evil German boxer.

negative;While 'Hereditary' is indeed moody and atmospherically shot, the story and dramaturgy don't come close to fulfilling what the barely explainable good reviews promise.

negative;Like probably most other soccer fans, I was really looking forward to Wortmann's documentary.

negative;Where is the impenetrable plot that captivates the viewer?

negative;Dante.

negative;Hmm... technology meets Viking.

negative;Otherwise such a push: implausible story, a (large) gang of clichÃ© actors and a disastrous Joaquin Phoenix ... Actors' studio facial expressions of the beginners' course, unbearable.

negative;"Apart from the acting, the dialogues were at best ""poor"", but seem rather wooden and anything but fluid or even plausible."

negative;And how do they move the story forward?

negative;3 out of 10 points.

negative;the main actress yakking away in one went on my nerves a bit at some point.

negative;Also the confusion of the victim-perpetrator relationship was just super eigesetzt.

negative;Build your own shit!

negative;Particular mention should be made of the film's score, which really underscores Electro absolutely appropriately and brilliantly, and also shines in other respects.

negative;What Verhoeven really messes up, however, is dealing with the actual subject.

negative;How often does she suffer and weep and shriek in despair over the dwindling well-being of the men in her life?

negative;It simply falls by the wayside and the best scenes have unfortunately already been revealed to us by the dear, good trailer.

negative;- - - - - - had stress and relax?

negative;The film starts interestingly, but despite good acting it gets boring and strange from the middle on.

negative;The characters lack depth, the story lacks a twist, the jokes lack a subtle touch - the whole film is more like a slapstick comedy.

negative;BUT the ending is so bad, unbelievable!

negative;Too bad!

negative;"So if you've dismissed a visit due to the ""let it go"" trauma already described; don't worry."

negative;Beteubungsstrahl and Nakengriff are mentioned, but are obviously not in fashion.

negative;The reason for this situation are zombie-like vampires that attack people at night.

negative;The question arises as to why the scriptwriters tendentiously failed to address this galaxy of issues.

negative;The cuts are too fast and hectic, the Bond girls don't stand out and the action scenes doesn't offer any innovative novelties.

negative;Is Clint Eastwood coming next time ?

negative;Disney is destroying the Star Wars universe!

negative;so in my opinion this film is overrated.

negative;The CGI was pretty good, especially in the finale, and I really liked the visual design elements as well, as they exuded creativity (unlike the story).

negative;If you like masked assassins, you can go in, if you love good horror shockers, should watch something else.

negative;Saga, I realized after just 20 minutes of play why fans are so upset.

negative;"Every now and then, the appearances of the ""evil puppeteer"" are also staged quite well, but that is simply not enough for a successful scary movie."

negative;I hope they cook the soup again according to the tried and true family recipe in the next Bond film.

negative;"A pedophile couple is associated with the Germans (""I have seen evil"") and the Russians are all criminals anyway."

negative;The movie has some nice scenes... I would probably find it quite passable even if I didn't play the games.

negative;The story itself is quickly told: a boy observes a suicide of a mafia lawyer, who before his death told him the location of a corpse, and since then has been in mortal danger.

negative;Not only did the cameraman not know what he was doing, but also the editor, who should really be forbidden to edit films again.

negative;In the end, you're glad that you finally made it through, if you didn't leave the movie theater beforehand.

negative;We've already had all that.

negative;In the middle section, I wondered if the screenwriters or the director or I were on drugs.

negative;For now the merciless slaughter is given a meaning: The search for the last son of a woman who might fall in the war, announced by unbearably loud and sad music.

negative;But I found rather the beginning difficult, because you could not get used to this style.

negative;Who or what is the Circus?

negative;The action is pictorial and well set and scene no question, but the rest of the film is just weak!

negative;Snipes and Antonio Banderas as a chatty, diva-like Spaniard and a grumbling Harrison Ford who doesn't understand Statham's Brit-accented gemumble, they all lack event factor.

negative;I have to praise the gritty and fast-paced production, and there's nothing great to fault the actors either.

negative;In my eyes, the only good thing about the movie was the first half hour.

negative;But aside from the hype (be it because of the characters, the books, or just Fincher in the director's chair), this is all an average crime thriller at best, a little harder now and then, but just not convincing because everything seems so unfocused.

negative;Crass?

negative;Conclusion: Cinematic brainwashing in which comes together what does not necessarily belong together!

negative;You get practically nothing.

negative;Consider running to the movies.

negative;The sequel, however, is completely free of all such approaches and is just what it is: a perfectly constructed product.

negative;The bottom line is that we're stepping it up a notch everywhere.

negative;Greetings Andy

negative;So who knows and loves the book, should save the cinema visit ,in my opinion!

negative;And Gerard Butler has enough opponents in front of his chest that it doesn't get boring.

negative;very frustrating.

negative;Ready.

negative;Totally disappointing!

negative;I can't understand how you can hire such bad actors in a commercial film production.

negative;Kale doesn't like the fact that Ashley makes other friends besides him and even has a party.

negative;The story itself was quite nice, but implementation, well I don't know.

negative;This question is also clarified in the course of the film.

negative;"All in all, ""Disturbia"" is a really disappointing film that ranks negatively with its genre colleagues."

negative;Too bad about the wasted time :-(

negative;Especially if you know the ratios and that the calculation of the quotas in Germany is even more accurate than in the media-governed USA, for example, this whole construct quickly flies into each other, despite normal weaknesses in such a large survey.

negative;In between, the whole work drags on quite a bit.

negative;No avnung why you shoot a film where you can puke because of the camera, which shakes more than an extremely lousy cell phone camera and released in 4KUHD.

negative;Chicago is in my opinion not necessarily a deserved Oscar winner... there is just too much dancing and singing in this film, and yes, now many will think that it was to be expected with this film.

negative;"Immediately I had to think of ""The Golden Compass"", there the viewer was left with more questions than answers in the room and you never heard anything again."

negative;The only thing that gives this flick another plus point are the effects.

negative;tears of the sun is not a film that can raise the bar for other war films.

negative;The film is also full of primitive and sexist...

negative;It's a film that you can pass the time with, but since the director didn't experiment or take risks in any way and also didn't show much flair, the whole thing unfortunately comes across as very bland.

negative;Then it should still be about revenge simply top.

negative;I mean, the kids are in Narnia for just a few days, and they're fighting with the weapons they've been given, as if they've been practicing for years.... The oldest boy is even put in charge of Aslan's rebel army.

negative;Just bad, poorly acted with 21st century expression, hardly any suspense.

negative;Although I am the biggest fan of Boondock Saints, the 2nd part has disappointed me already in the first quarter of an hour.

negative;Away from lacquered, one-dimensional kitsch, towards ambivalent complexity.

negative;As a story in itself it's okay, though not special, in the shaky-cam look the number turns out downright unbearable.

negative;Or did the creators just want to make a kÃ¶modie that pokes fun at various genres?

negative;What you get to see, however, is less surprising.

negative;We found the film so overloaded and clichÃ© that we left the auditorium before the film ended, when we realized how the stories would end.

negative;This film is complete nonsense, and then also quite boring.

negative;If you are just about to have a nice evening with the Exorsist, the Omen and further, then you can resort to The Exorcism of Emily Rose without hesitation.

negative;It feels like the only way to create an emotional film was to come up with a story that would appeal to as many people as possible.

negative;The story is weak.

negative;I am still in the ev.

negative;Well, what can you say about that?

negative;"This time as an occult witch hunter; with a spark of ""Highlander"" in it ... but unfortunately without a chance."

negative;Better than the 1.

negative;There is little attention to detail here and many scenes seem superfluous.

negative;Even the actors couldn't make up for that with charm, because in the end I really hoped that there was a deeper meaning between all the cheating.

negative;Somewhere I read that the film was exhausting, among other things.

negative;In between, you sometimes literally feel like you're in the wrong movie, because you seem to have lost the connection to the context.

negative;However, I have to criticize the camera work.

negative;Have a nice evening at the movies

negative;13.

negative;"Also the sentence from the Potsdam Conference, ""we want peace for the world"" is a bit too little, if one wants to draw a comparison with the wars still being waged today (Enduring freedom ...)."

negative;If in the original cases the perpetrator was able to save himself, it is now impossible.

negative;[...]It's always the same when the Aniston pops up in these R-rated comedies that flirt with the sexiness of being in her mid-forties and cramp Swearwords: none of these attempts to break out of the mold of the heartwarming RomCom are as good or even as funny as they could be, and occasionally hint at being.[...

negative;But what came out is probably not everyone's cup of tea.

negative;It was my mistake.

negative;The insights into Bond's childhood and thus his psyche remain absolutely superficial, also the relationship with M, who is supposed to be something like a surrogate mother, does not become tangible at all.

negative;"Where ""Avatar"" at least still works with a message, the action here runs as if pulled on a string and completely without a goal."

negative;Here would be the thing with Santa Claus.

negative;You can talk about the stupid story, the, apart from the main character almost completely superfluous rest of the cast (anyone who writes of the patch with tits and rubber lips she would be good or even better than bad can never have seen good), the completely unnecessary overlength, the completely stupid, downright medieval patriotism (I'm really not an America-opponent, but I'm not constantly running around with ner Germany flag), one (or more?)

negative;On the one hand, the disturbed individual has spared no expense or effort to play lifeguard games with his victims.

negative;Parker wants to get married, the symbiote falls to Earth, J.J..

negative;I expected more.

negative;Otherwise, it is technically quite well implemented, the scenes are successful.

negative;The synchronize themselves yes also their dÃ¶del!

negative;The actors in Harry Potter act reasonably well, with a few exceptions, and Ron in particular can really amuse from time to time.

negative;Simple-minded as he is, he needs the immediate and directly comprehensible link to reality, without which his play would degenerate into unintentional comedy.

negative;The three hours could have been shortened to 90min.

negative;comments the wounded Tarantino fan soul speaks.

negative;And despite my wise foresight that nothing special would await me, and my effort to find something to take away from it, as the plot progressed I found it increasingly difficult to ignore the unintentional comedy inherent in the universe of the shield-wielding pretty boy.

negative;Stargate by Roland Emmerich is apparently one of his best works.

negative;This could have been such a good movie, if only it wasn't so completely illogical!

negative;The story is lukewarm, the characters and actors remain flat, the action is right for long stretches.

negative;Not only do they bring nothing to the film (characters like Storm (Alexandra Shipp) or Psylocke (Olivia Munn) are completely characterless and really burnt out), no, they also bring nothing to Apocalypse, who also lets himself be taken less and less seriously, when in the first half of the film he only deals with re-dressing his 4 horsemen.

negative;"Because it's about the American military, about a single family, about two giant bat monsters trying to mate, and about a time bomb; the movie is NOT about Godzilla.______________ If you want to watch the movie because of Bryan Cranston, you should not."

negative;You have to be quite an alien fan to get through the very lengthy story without yawning.

negative;The female lead, Laura Haddock, turns out to be a mimic pipe-cracker in her role of Viviane Wembley.

negative;Unfortunately, I was disappointed: The camera work was probably supposed to bring about suspense and realism.

negative;Therefore: 1 out of 5 points.

negative;Why is Scotty not detected on approach to the station where apparently the Dreadnaught is being built?

negative;Just too embarrassing the performance of John Malkovich.

negative;The main character has no depth, you have no idea how he became what he is.

negative;The basic idea is great, but the film is a waste of time.

negative;If there is a 3rd part, I will definitely do without.

negative;At least the finale offers a bit more pace and at least minor surprises.

negative;McGuire and DiCaprio alone are appropriately cast and I would love to see them in a more intimate and natural staging of the Gatsby material.

negative;So one day you get carried away and watch it on the evening program to be convinced of its magnificence.

negative;The story, which is basically well set, gets lost towards the end while the whole movie degenerates into half-baked, unambitious nonsense.

negative;In my eyes, however, not a particularly good film.

negative;"I don't want to go so much into the film itself, everything has actually already been said in the review...    Only times to the rumor ""true story"": Fact is: it is NOT based on a true story."

negative;Spoiler: Now she's grown up and is more or less with a boy who's the size of a matchstick, all right....  Conclusion: Epic is a loveless film that seems completely irrelevant in retrospect and is probably only for the very young.

negative;He just wants to shock with his medieval approach.

negative;Yes, two low-budget productions around interaction with aliens who have been visiting for some time.

negative;In Saxon Switzerland (that would at least have horror potential)?

negative;When I saw it in theaters, I thought it was good at first, a good, swanky ending to the trilogy.

negative;"Abrams is right when he says, ""This movie can't live up to the high expectations."""

negative;"To leave no doubt, one of the protagonists says in a scene, as he is already spitting blood on the floor: ""I'm not well""."

negative;as crass as that may sound.

negative;Unfortunately, that just doesn't want to happen even after one hundred minutes.

negative;The other boy, Columbus, is still tolerable, as are the two girls, but they didn't have any dialogue or lines I could laugh at either.

negative;Some of the subplots could have been left out.

negative;Nevertheless, have fun watching!

negative;"In the figure of Robinson, the utopia is first created before the reader's eyes, as the hero, so sympathetic because of his courage, self-confidence, and infinite hope, goes through the ""civilization process en miniature,"" thus a manageable cultural genesis."

negative;The bar was very high for this film after Skyfall and Casino Royal.

negative;I don't understand the hype that seems to surround this film.

negative;Despite good acting performances by Brenton Thwaites, Alicia Vikander, and of course Ewan McGregor, who stands out the most, it's not enough for more, though.

negative;maybe something for little girls but absolutely nothing for women's nights out.

negative;Now to the second part it is of course again a revenge thriller but it only rehashes a few stories from the first part.

negative;Although I am a fan of Natalie, I find the film weak...  Kitsch ala Dead Poets Society...

negative;We get it: ClichÃ© of an embarrassing wedding speech, impossible guy, bride has groom's best friend....yesyes!

negative;On the whole, however, the acting is rather lower average....

negative;age from.

negative;Non-trekkers and young trekkers get action fare from a household can, Trekkies of the first hour are snubbed and SF fans are confronted - as so often in recent years - with the realization that the genre no longer films new ideas, no groundbreaking concepts, but relies on the safe box office ideas.

negative;What remains the morning after the movie night?

negative;It won't last a year...!

negative;Everything seems too cluttered, too gigantic.

negative;What's the point?

negative;Those who followed it at the time won't find much to like about the film.

negative;Pretty nonsensical story with nice effects and a quite good idea in ''sinking ships'' (Battleship).

negative;Some jokes shown in the trailer are missing.

negative;Soderbergh's sequel overreaches itself with its playful story, wants to seem cool and instead comes across as rather tedious, because there are no clear lines in the story and the director doesn't know how to find new sides to his characters.

negative;But if you are looking for action with a little sense and maybe level you should go for another movie.

negative;The story really has something.

negative;"But this ""climax"" is unfortunately the only one the film has to show."

negative;"I'm not a racist or anything... but I hate Americans, yo""."

negative;It's a shame that this cult figure isn't who she used to be years ago.

negative;He saves the man from his henchmen and eventually has to escape himself....Laaaaa boring and illogical...

negative;Certainly, it was clear that the film adaptation could not take over every plot thread of the good and intricate story of the book, but what was delivered here is quite funny.

negative;So if this was the first Resident Evil movie I ever saw, I would loathe the film series.

negative;The actually interesting character of Steve Buscemi has an incredible potential, but is treated so superficially and prejudiced that it soon hurts to watch it.

negative;Definitely not a children's movie.

negative;So not Will :-(

negative;Conclusion: Not bad, but the film can not really convince.

negative;"I have never seen such a boring ""horror"" movie."

negative;Part 2 wasn't bad either, wasn't quite as convincing as part 1, but still a good movie.

negative;Acting-wise, everything falls by the wayside.

negative;Just because something is successful doesn't mean you have to make a series.

negative;"One is so doggedly going for a big surprise moment here that one deliberately takes the most unthinkable possibility of all and defiantly holds it out to the viewer, only to be able to triumphantly say ""You didn't expect that, did you?""[...]."

negative;:-)    Technically, the only thing to complain about is the soundtrack, which is incredibly loud and extremely intrusive.

negative;"A Robert De Niro-themed party, including ""You talkin' to me?"" and ""Focker"" quotes, is staged away outrageously fast in a montage sequence, perhaps the best gag is anticipated by the trailers, and anyway the whole thing is just a purposeless and incoherent Punch and Judy show that may not be boring, but is likely to be forgotten the morning after."

negative;"The scenes of violence are at best implied, hardly bloody and shocking; the makers lack the courage (no, the will) to show how children really kill each other."

negative;Just like all the other actors, in particular Harrison Ford.

negative;With this, the plot is somewhat lost.

negative;"In the hair the expensive wax / the expensive gel, on the body the clothes of famous designers and a propos ""body"", there the main character makes fun of men sweating in gyms and shows at every opportunity his steeled body therefore... must probably come from the beer."

negative;But everyone is otherwise convincing in their roles.

negative;"The acting is okay so far, only Ben Affleck unfortunately failed to portray ""Batman"" as a superhero."

negative;How eagerly was this event awaited and how great was the hype?

negative;In Armageddon, you don't get any time at all to really realize what's happening, there's one catastrophe after another, it doesn't get more unrealistic than that.

negative;Thank you David Yates for the second bad film adaptation.

negative;Well, the music is Abba, but everything else that distinguishes a musical film from listening to a CD is mediocre to bad.

negative;Maybe this movie convinces with its charismatic lead actor and good acting performances, but for emotionally dulled men like me, who can't get into the romantic mood, the movie offers no entertainment value, because the plot is, as with most love movies predictable and the humor is also very bland and offers at most an occasional smirk.

negative;Every now and then you can laugh but that's it.

negative;"I had thought I could laugh here at a Johnny Depp as a vampire come to life because everywhere it says ""comedy"" as the genre."

negative;"I remember walking past the poster with a friend in the cinema, he said ""I've heard it's good!"" and I replied ""Yeah, maybe - but it seems to me like a film that's definitely not much fun!"

negative;The thought process behind it, which I can not reveal for spoiler reasons, was not so bad but this cheesy implementation was really not at all!

negative;Highly acclaimed, came highly recommended to me, the trailer looks awesome: I had to see this movie.

negative;Unfortunately, an absolute mistake as far as this film is concerned.

negative;The creepiest were the Turks with us in the hall who had to laugh all the time.

negative;"The only thing is: the rules that Mr. Tarantino breaks are followed by most filmmakers for good reason; if you break them, there should be a good reason, you should be able to come up with a better idea."

negative;But fiddlesticks!

negative;The doctor fingers his daughter and in between also likes to do it with the village midwife.

negative;The action scenes are quite well done.

negative;Zb at least two of the dwarves should have been killed.

negative;It all looks great but it also gets boring quickly.

negative;Yes it is indeed the villain from the first part!

negative;The second attempt is better than part 1, but still no real laugh.

negative;I could even so with the Mageln continue but that's enough now I think everyone has his own opinion for this film and can decide for themselves!

negative;In terms of content, the film merely conveys the fact of how transient life is.

negative;Unfortunately, I now believe that the Nolan name was simply used for advertising purposes.

negative;Also the actors, one could not have chosen worse udn to their roles!

negative;"Conclusion: No Romeo & Juliet retelling, but absurd children's film on the track of ""Toy Story"" without any noteworthy highlghts."

negative;"Until then, we watch as dressed-up superheroes jump off the school roof, everyone spontaneously whips out their cell phones, and R.Kelly's ""I Blieve I Can Fly"" plays somewhere in the background."

negative;his role doesn't demand much of him, yet he makes the best of it.

negative;The miscarriages are treated too briefly (in the book much more dramatically described) The film itself builds up too little tension, to see the story only from Clair's point of view is a bit boring.

negative;Caine is absolutely outstanding, you just want to share his company over a glass of whiskey.

negative;So the Loft is easily enough for an entertaining, sometimes funny movie night.

negative;Until the first characters died, I was very bored and thought more often about going home, but I still had hope.

negative;There is so no room for humor and somehow everything seems too intentional, too staged and just overdone...  1.5 stars I give for the good special effects and the otherwise of course undeniably good way of making the film.

negative;a bad film with bad adaptations of some fairy tales.

negative;"The guest appearances make the film look rather cheap and they had dug some ""B"" celebs out of the woodwork."

negative;That is, one of the reasons why the trailer has pleasantly little spoilers might be that there is simply nothing to spoil: a little (great played) girl ends up with a giant and his fantasy world and just spends time with him - end.

negative;What's the point was Crank cool new innovative fast good to follow plot is part 2 some wannabe art nonsense action movie that psychedelic drug guys might like.

negative;Unfortunately, in one scene in particular, you see the CGI come out too often and it really doesn't look good.

negative;No really good ideas, tight but 08/15-moderate staging and decent actors!

negative;The film could have been so much more!

negative;The first time a wizard with the charm of a Valium tablet (er... yeah, Harry Potter) loses out.

negative;It remains until the end, however, more or less, exciting, because you do not know what actually awaits you or what the murder at the beginning because actually should now.

negative;These little details are totally missing from the film.

negative;Well, anyway... then the scene with the police station came and a black miniskirt say I knew: Yes!

negative;From the beginning of the film to the end, I completely bought his embodiment of the little Shire man.

negative;The highlight of the cast, and also in terms of acting, is undoubtedly Sir Ian McKellen.

negative;More humor, more charm, steady camera, sensible, comprehensible story told, and happy to use technical gimicks and beautiful women.

negative;my children and I were disappointed.

negative;So what is the man trying to tell us?

negative;The film touches you?

negative;The story is strange, the acting is subterranean, and the effects in the film are noticeably computer-derived.

negative;Who is aware of this and has also seen the one or other report via television, Internet, etc..

negative;Although the most extreme violence is hinted at there, it is not really shown.

negative;Only actresses and when men appear there, they are portrayed as stupid.

negative;Also, a major logic flaw arises in this finale.

negative;my advice: better watch 28 days later again and don't be deterred by the lower rating...

negative;The supporting actors, also to mention Josh Brolin stand out neither negatively nor positively.

negative;The story is interesting in parts, but I don't find it profound enough and very drawn out.

negative;But the film was so shallow that, in retrospect, we gave the book more depth than we had up to that point.

negative;But let's be honest, a lot of handmade action, paired with a bit of modernity (like in the 2nd film).

negative;Thank God I wasn't at the cinema and watched this film.

negative;Beautifully done this film, but does that mean you have to ignore these extremely obvious logic flaws?

negative;The first part of Crank is one of my top 10 favorite movies!

negative;How the attack of this SS company on the tank is furthermore presented in military tactics(shooting gallery hits it quite well), is a bad joke and then only the tip of the iceberg.

negative;If that's not creepy, what is?

negative;the film is just dull and builds no athmosphere.

negative;At the end remains a handsome work that visually hits the mark.

negative;Snail-like and without highs and lows, the speakers roll through the story.

negative;Verdict: Electrifying main character and an unbelievably awful scenario towards the end .

negative;After they arrive by ship in a confusing town, the Samburu warrior Lemalian (Jaky Ido) keeps meeting them and helping them out of trouble.

negative;As I said, I was disappointed by the synchro, a JJ Liefers was probably so thin that they had to make the sound louder.

negative;This is about death.

negative;"The reactions in the cinema were a colorful mixture of: ""What a sh****"" or ""pffft.... such a piece of junk"" or even ""what a waste of time"" to ""we would have preferred to see something else""."

negative;On top of that, the characters behave extremely stupidly.

negative;....and tragically, the only good thing about this movie is Depp.

negative;What would the plan have looked like if a capable director had focused more on his actors, instead of cranking out a bloated 300-page script with no real historical substance from a twenty-page booklet?

negative;So do I.

negative;Hugh Jackman suits the role of Wolverine quite well, but this character demands from Jackman a permanently sorry and strained-annoyed facial expression, animalistic butchery actions with attempted but failed coolness and groaning-croaking broken & broken guy attitude.

negative;The ending, different as expected but consistent, also deserves praise.

negative;"The fight between Bane and Batman was too obvious and much too ""normal"" for a ""grand finale"", absolutely nothing that will be remembered."

negative;A typical Bay film.

negative;Russell Crowe remains pale, Mark Strong is absolutely meaningless as the villain, Oscar Isaac has too little screen time to make his villain come across strongly and Max von Sydow does his best.

negative;although i am a huge independent film fan.

negative;Unfortunately, that's where it ends.

negative;The ending is predictable, but not bad, although I can not understand the action of the policeman at all!

negative;But in the overall rating, I tell you, I would never watch this movie again, never spend any more money on it, I would prefer to forget it, that's how boring it was in parts.

negative;As I said, I think Terminator 3 is good as a standalone action film.

negative;Because it is still the same and that NERVT.

negative;Where will the teens be abandoned next?!

negative;I think there would be few actors who would be able to do that.

negative;For children definitely a hit and a few grins for the restwaren in any case.

negative;It all seems contrived and without real emotion.

negative;"This film is also reminiscent of ""Total Recall"", but you don't always feel the excitement, because you can guess a lot of things."

negative;be transferred to preserve some of its massiveness.

negative;Actually, no one should be afraid!

negative;The film can never make up its mind.

negative;The film didn't particularly scare me, nor was there much of a sense of psychological depth.

negative;While there are some very funny parts, the story is so unbelievable that it screws up the whole movie in my opinion.

negative;But it was nothing at all.

negative;Overall, a low-budget film not worth watching.

negative;It may be that the film had some good moments.

negative;A well-intentioned film, but one that ultimately becomes nothing more than a test of patience for the viewer.

negative;It is presented without mockery and malice: One sees Dylan preaching about the kingdom of God, about salvation, singing.

negative;"By no means is ""Self Talk"" a must-see film, by no means is it a film whose fun factor increases exponentially with the number of friends present."

negative;This would be material for great cinema, but unfortunately the film drowns in melodramatic string sounds.

negative;Otherwise, many issues are addressed but not played out.

negative;They tried to pack this movie full of a lot of stuff.

negative;But his role is also quite superfluous.

negative;At every corner, kids fuck with you, you can't sleep at night, and people are constantly shooting everywhere for no reason.

negative;I have often heard the same opinion from my circle of friends.

negative;The dialogues & the actions of the actors are just stupid and annoying.

negative;And beyond that even in the later course of the films and series were actually exchanged...that already testifies to the fact that these characters are simply not really important and actually a viewer can not seriously captivate... with which already times the whole adventures do not really work and keienrlei tension can build...

negative;The love story is beautiful and very romantic, but as a viewer you are kind of left in the air.

negative;"Quite loosely based on the 272seiter published in 2003, ""21""."

negative;"But a bit more depth would have done the film good, maybe just a bit more serious in the sense that real ""messages"" are conveyed, like in ""Big Fish"" a bit more profound and honest."

negative;The film is too short, you had the feeling that the film itself was in a hurry to finish quickly.

negative;There is no authority that supervises a private bank or private central bank.

negative;With great expectations I have now looked at the new grindhouse / splatter outpouring of Mr. Rodriguez, and was again as with Planet Terror or Death Proof bitterly disappointed.

negative;This story is a fairy tale nothing else.

negative;But at least in Amir's case it is a marriage of choice, very progressive!

negative;"The action of the film is limited to ""making a little noise and scaring up the chickens""; that's more or less how the protagonists put it into words."

negative;I thought 28 days later was brilliant.

negative;The film is carried solely by the acting performance.

negative;They are still so innocent!

negative;The characters seem very superficial, the story is too thin and tension is largely absent.

negative;"Jack Nicholson as a psychopath is of course not bad in his ""standard role"" either."

negative;But the political situation has been drastically exacerbated by the Greek national debt and the Edward Snowden revelations.

negative;Part will come - despite my geunk here.

negative;Certainly, the action is in the first place and it was also well staged.

negative;"I had read the book ""The Centenarian ..."" years ago and was thrilled, the movie made from it was already less fascinating."

negative;Worst movie I have ever seen.

negative;I would have liked an ending that cleared things up more.

negative;The film not only raises questions and problems - it also answers them: with a two-hour fantasy of omnipotence and revenge as an all-round solution.

negative;The film had hardly shock moments and blatantly brutal he was not really he is probably what for horror beginners.

negative;What was still annoying after some time in the course of the film were the clumsy slapstick attempts to create laughs by H. Grant dancing, grimacing and singing.

negative;Evil and good are engaged in an eternal battle.

negative;I really liked his performance as the arrogant doctor who absolutely hairs on his title.

negative;"Perhaps some consideration was given to the drawings of ""Manhatten"" in the original comic, which is the only excuse for this."

negative;David, Russell, Judy and their assistant manage to escape.

negative;Bland actors, lame dialogue.

negative;In New York, Franky (now calling himself Roy) tries to negotiate a deal with mob boss Billy Burke.

negative;There are positive moments, no question, but unfortunately they can't trump the negative aspects.

negative;The film had bad plots.

negative;Read all the HP books that were available at the time.

negative;These are pretty much the strongest acting scenes in the entire film.

negative;"overall the movie is not bad but just because of the length, the lack of creativity and the unbalanced style of scott ""Man under fire"" is highest mediocrity !"

negative;"The shooting of the little dog, on the other hand, was added as a superfluous and cruel detail so that even the last person would keep in mind that Hitler was ""evil""."

negative;It is so fast-paced that the images and colors literally fly around your ears.

negative;I hope for the next movie^^ The trailer seems to be quite good^^

negative;In any case, I can't recommend it.

negative;Visually, the film doesn't do much either and it actually moves in a pretty small world.

negative;It's not a blockbuster, but it's not quite that bad.

negative;Christoph Waltz's part seems a bit out of place, the character just doesn't give enough over the length of the film.

negative;The film will appeal to audiences who prefer simple, somehow staged good-versus-evil carnage.

negative;I mean of course such films do not have to be logical but a little more I expected apart from that it lacked suspense.this is just a very rough description of my side, basically I can write books about what makes the film so incredibly bad but enough otherwise I have to throw up.I hope that there are more sane reasonable people who are of my opinion.

negative;And NATURALLY in the original Spanish (with subtitles).

negative;The actors did a really good job.

negative;In any case, this film is too extreme in its message to seem credible.

negative;This is where Star Trek Beyond completely fails.

negative;I don't really care in which direction a film goes, be it funny or serious - only the balance has to be right.

negative;But first, the plot: Everest is based on the true events of the Mount Everest disaster in 1996.

negative;It was always the same effects as in the first part.

negative;Abrahams as director of the series.

negative;So far so good, if it weren't for the occasionally stupid dialogs that wear things down.

negative;Last but not least remains Ben Kingsley.

negative;"Of course, they serve to make the viewer feel believable and uncomfortable or ""creeped out,"" but it also constantly reminds you that these are all supposed to be just re-enacted scenes."

negative;But all this is not enough to tear the film out.

negative;Man of Steel isn't as bad as Superman Returns, which isn't hard to do in my opinion.

negative;And the envelope Billy hands to Madolyn, which is oh so important, doesn't show up in the rest of the fime.

negative;4.when Wormtail cuts off his hand, he cries out once more not.isn't it so that he rolls on the floor in the book and whines.

negative;Winslet won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

negative;In the book there is the chronology of the story and only one (very long) flash back (half book).

negative;The past is told in a multi-faceted way, but without any real context.

negative;Horror does not arise at any second.

negative;Not a good movie.

negative;The input sequence is i.

negative;Katana ?

negative;I left the film disappointed because I couldn't figure out what the director was trying to achieve with all the visual compositions, storylines and dialogs.

negative;Even if the plot itself seems interesting, it is unfortunately not originally knostruiert, even tires in the long run.

negative;Conclusion: Overlong, completely irrelevant finale in terms of content, which exchanges the creative, cool ideas that started this series for a lame zombie story!

negative;"""We just blow up a few ""systemic"" cities and say he (Dr Manhattan) did it and the whole world unites in joy their hatred of this one""...huh."

negative;CGI fireworks?

negative;Well, I didn't think the movie was that great either....

negative;"""The Hobbit 2: The Desolation of Smaug"" can entertain, of course, and it does so with the dwarves' distinct sense of humor."

negative;It's a solid action haunted crime thriller with tried and true ingredients.

negative;The spark between the two main characters does not want to jump over.

negative;It wasn't great and is far from being my favorite comedy, but it managed to entertain me and proved to have more charm than the trailers would have suggested.

negative;Pay close attention, the same doll from SAW is hiding in the movie.

negative;"So Rupert Sanders, known for music videos and commercials, gets to make a movie all his own, which cost the studios millions of dollars, but apparently the guys were like, "" Hey, we haven't done anything totally stupid yet this year, how about it?"""

negative;"If you want to see a slightly newer movie with Cage, ""Pact of Revenge"", ""Tokarev"" or ""Joe"" are not outstanding, but still better than ""Drive Angry""."

negative;Otherwise, however, the film annoyed me mainly by its (visual) kitsch.

negative;That the film is in black and white adds even more intensity to the already dreary atmosphere.

negative;The skilled comedian Boon hits the diaphragm a few times with facial expressions and more through slapstick than wordplay, but the viewer has to wait a long time for reasonably well-staged fun, namely for the back section of the film, the comedy of errors.

negative;The only convincing actor is John Goodman, who plays the choleric and sensitive (The Big Lebowski says hello) father of the villain.

negative;And that's exactly what Stiller should have reduced his story to: A short film or, for all I care, a charming commercial series.

negative;Neat jokes and a halfway sensible bringing together of the storylines/characters save the film.

negative;The animations are sub-par for such a production.

negative;A rebellion looks different somehow.

negative;Conclusion: Fast-paced scene changes and great images.

negative;Imagine you are listening to your favorite song with which you have good memories on the radio and as it slowly picks up speed, just before the chorus comes a traffic message and the feeling is gone.

negative;Start at the beginning, bigger is not better and they still haven't figured that out.

negative;The Notebook, a romance with a not-so-new plot.

negative;The crowning touch to the whole spectacle is the overblown ending.

negative;Laudable intention, but the result turns out to be so disgusting and repulsive because not one of the characters has any sympathetic or likeable quality and one sits in front of this kaleidoscope of assholes quite perplexed.

negative;Defend yourselves!

negative;and that it is not faithful to the novel, just like the weak script.

negative;Apart from the fact that it is probably chic to give this film 10 points or that some people are offended by the rather bad reviews of this film for some reason (maybe you can see some truth in one or the other point of criticism), this film also seems rather weak to me.

negative;The actors are good and played their roles well.

negative;But the drugs were mainly the classics alcohol and cigarettes.

negative;"The second time ""Army of Darkness"", after many years, did not convince me nearly as much now."

negative;"For my taste, the film has far too little plot (which only really begins after an hour)-for beautiful pictures I prefer to watch ""Our Earth""."

negative;Everything just doesn't seem as rounded as in the first part.

negative;In the meantime, Anna comes into Antonio's room and says that she was paid by his friends, but Antonio doesn't know anything about it and doesn't even know these so-called friends.

negative;At least the ending is coherent again and the film is photographed quite well in places.

negative;Of course, they are all younger and fresher and come across differently.

negative;Absolutely exciting and quickly told peppered with good acting performance of all actors.

negative;Good for falling asleep under certain circumstances.

negative;But, of course, the knot will be cut.

negative;I had high expectations for this film, not least because of the extremely positive reviews at filmstarts.de I must unfortunately state: My expectations were disappointed all along the line.

negative;This is a film for friends of arthouse cinema, they can expect two moving and very exhausting hours of film.

negative;I hadn't read the book, so I can't write anything more about the realization than probably failed.A nice fairy tale, consisting of beautiful pictures, but no trace of captivating or rousing.

negative;that is simply missing in this film.

negative;Only the first 15/20min with Christopher Walz are worth watching, the rest is so clumsy that you don't want to watch it at all.

negative;"3/4 of the movie looked like a particularly bad episode of the already bad series ""Hotel""."

negative;You just keep watching to find out what happens at the end.

negative;:) funny, macabre,scary, beautiful!

negative;Neither gags nor cool sayings.

negative;A few things I would have liked to have been explained in the film:    Why don't the aliens fight back despite their weapons?

negative;For example, the sometimes lacking understanding of language between men and women is shown in a really funny way.

negative;In this respect, I would recommend the film if there is nothing else on the weekend, but unfortunately, the ''Outbreak'' can not particularly stand out from the usual disaster films.

negative;so somehow a back and forth - know myself ned from XD

negative;However, due to his status, the latter could not publish the works himself.

negative;"In summary, I would describe the film as ""quite nice""."

negative;Even if his films are always populated by famous actors, it is not mainstream but a world of its own, always with a peculiar atmosphere that is somehow happy, sad and thoughtful at the same time.

negative;nevertheless, the film is for long stretches deceptive and probably more of a women's film.

negative;Often from one scene to the next, from one character trait to the opposite.

negative;in his new job.

negative;With each new strip, the Wayans boys become more and more unbearable, because they are definitely unfunny.

negative;Which makes him almost a slave for mother Angelica.

negative;You could have gotten a lot more out of it.

negative;Especially not to one so famous, The question of why he is so famous remains.

negative;Additionally, the characters move from place to place so quickly that it just doesn't make sense.

negative;With the traffic accidents at the intersections and in the tunnel, you might scratch your head and wonder how such a thing is even possible?

negative;"), in addition absolutely humor- and irony-free and thus you can with the characters also times grad do nothing, because 0 sympathy or understanding arises; the only tension, which is held over almost 3 hours, is the hope that finally something happens ... from it one could have made really 'a beautiful series Ã  la X-MEN, then also more time would have been for the backstories, but so I've annoyed me like rarely, 6.20 and 3 hours of life in the Gulli have thrown ... sorry, but the time to stare at a white wall makes just as much sense!"

negative;That the story is banana, the actors act on the back burner, this is all justifiable and was somehow expected ...  Please do not misunderstand, although I also liked High Tension and Inside needs for me a film no high gore content to be good, I love Usual Suspects or Brick, Dark Knight is also great, but in Rogue I just expected a bit more blood.

negative;there were good approaches, only the execution was miserable.

negative;But that didn't help Death Race at all, because the rest of what the movie builds on is very weak!!!!

negative;The buildup of feelings toward the individual actors is never detailed, or the psychology of the individual actors is always somehow implausible or impossible to understand.

negative;And so the film shimmies from one action spectacle to the next and then finally loses any ambition to tell a story.    Micheal BAY is slowly no longer a victim... Too many things this man does are so useless, that even internet critics are tired of scolding this man...

negative;On the other hand, the two main characters sometimes make such crude and completely dry comments, in this suitably sterile butcher shop, that one can have a deliciously good time.

negative;dollars and does almost no advertising for this film and then wonders about the lack of moviegoers.

negative;Setup and narrative structure is perfect, no logic gaps.

negative;"Shock scenes were not spared either (highlight: a ""swallowed"" baseball bat!)"

negative;Maybe he should keep it to smaller issues and not always work on the really big problems.

negative;Namely, how simple and clumsy it is to manipulate many moviegoers.

negative;"Even that whole ""trust no one"" agent thing I just found boring, since - contrary to my nature - I knew at all times who was playing false and who wasn't."

negative;I hope the next blockbuster is then again with BANG, BOOM and much, much BANG.

negative;More of an average movie.

negative;Imagine the Alps as a flatland.

negative;You really don't have to watch the film.

negative;I think that especially the films with anti-heroes have a great potential to be exploited.

negative;"Fittingly, James Horner's score (after Gabriel Yared's version was rejected as ""too old-fashioned"" after a year of work) is also lame, repetitive and uninspired."

negative;Well.

negative;"About the movie ""The fabulous world of Amelie"": The story is basically not bad and also something quite different, but due to the length of the strip (117 min) the actual story gets lost in it."

negative;A classic Tarantino, with pointed dialogue and great background music.

negative;I think I understood some of the scenes correctly.

negative;There's no drama, just dull entertainment, and I've had enough of that this year.

negative;All who went out of the cinema with me were disappointed

negative;I think Luc Besson had a few ideas about scenes and then tried to link them together.

negative;And where was the red thread, please?

negative;One could add to this list forever!

negative;There is no suspense at any time and Bale is also lost in his role as an FBI agent.

negative;"At some point you are stunned by what is happening, no longer know what comes from where and even suspects in the score a Parellele to the BAM BAM BAM.... from the ""Terminator"" - films."

negative;The film contains nothing but a concentrated two hours of frustration, crying women driven by suicidal desires who seem to break down over bogus problems, although any kind of motivation for these thoughts is lost on me, as the suicide seems to be a pure end in itself to press the viewer's tear gland and deliver a wannabe sophisticated film.

negative;But you still miss the eccentricity, the stylistic confidence from ''Kill Bill'' and ''Pulp Fiction'' enormously.

negative;These passages are all staged in a dull manner.

negative;"But since he can't fight, he forms ""The Union of Super Evil Villains""."

negative;It's pretty much not happening.

negative;It's a shame, because I look forward to every superhero film adaptation.

negative;Well, my taste is not necessarily mainstream, but the fellow occupants in the cinema were also not significantly more laughing.

negative;You can't make movies like this in the third millennium: creaking floorboards and doors that slam shut by themselves....

negative;The entire flashbacks only show Neville's separation from his wife and daughter, the overall extent is not made clear.

negative;You just get the feeling that LaBeouf doesn't want to play this role anymore and just wants to get it over with quickly.

negative;Only landscape fans get their money's worth here.

negative;"And then when you go home, you can say, ""That movie had real depth."""

negative;So what else was supposed to be fun in the movie?

negative;for gonorrhea - oh my god...

negative;But it lacks mystery and poetry.

negative;Unfortunately, the film could not convince me!

negative;the film really did not appeal to me

negative;How can anyone rate such nonsense good!?

negative;Not for a single moment is the action of killing questioned.

negative;They are what give Hawaii its flair.

negative;Clint Eastwood has not often been that bad in his choice to direct a film.

negative;i liked the idea of the biocrosslinking.

negative;i would prefer the film to have either a completely open ending or 2 twists.

negative;In short, a rather bad film.

negative;Too bad actually, how to make a second part good, but has actually shown Mr. Raimi

negative;"For 7 euros you should rather borrow 2 good porn in the video store...;)  Since you have more of!"

negative;"b) in the stylish apartment of the scientist (Ethan Hawke) the following happens several times: you hear a softly spoken ""security alert"" from the off, and soon - without any noise or the like - you are standing in front of the camera."

negative;Arlo & Spot does pretty much the opposite.

negative;Affleck earns in the film 120000$ in the year (gross) and John Wells tries to make the spectator nevertheless actually weis, that he has nothing Erpsartes, and not even a play console for 180â‚¬ can afford.

negative;...Disappointment!

negative;I am disappointed beyond measure.

negative;So far the worst part of the series (5&6 not seen yet).

negative;The remaining 121 episodes were not shown until the early 1990s by ProSieben and the cable channel (as well as its successor Kabel 1).

negative;Not my case, but that should not spoil it for anyone else.

negative;Stylistically, the old films were much closer to the original than this one.

negative;And an Oscar nomination?

negative;For the most part, the big-name actors fall short of their animation chops.

negative;Right up front, I'm pretty sure I won't watch this movie a second time.

negative;Have so many scenes fallen victim to the cutting mania?

negative;Wouldn't Sid and Scrat with his cute *PIIIEP???

negative;Absolutely first-rate incensing, but the supposed political message and the twist at the end celebrated in the Filmstarts review are so dishonest and inconsistent as to be an annoyance.

negative;i can only agree with the first criticism.

negative;Also in serious.

negative;But at least pretty awesome effects!

negative;This is not a Brad Pitt movie - in case anyone thought that or wanted to see it with that in mind.

negative;"Conclusion: If you expect a funny comedy in ""Up In The Air"", you will only be really entertained in the first half hour, otherwise it's more of a romantic comedy with a weakening story in the course of the film."

negative;How can people claim that this film is a masterpiece and how can this film only be broadcast on German television!

negative;At least the close-ups could have been shot with costumes, but they were not.

negative;Overall, an inconsistent story with comically acting actors.

negative;Thanks to computer technology, the setting and effects are worth seeing.

negative;Idris Elba, however, is really a positive point.

negative;Attention, cult danger!

negative;But that's all the positives.

negative;for bullshit and cannot gain the slightest thing from it.

negative;A movie is normally meant to beguile the viewer with great images---here, unfortunately, predictable and boring.

negative;by communicating with Satan or whatever, just badly done ---> But it's all just a matter of taste.....

negative;Conclusion: If you like Jessica Alba, you should go for Sin City...

negative;Contra: - extremely flat from the half - The deeds & actions drift completely into the absurd and unbelievable Spoiler: - What do you actually make a defusing robot with machine gun and rocket launcher attachment out of in your spare time?

negative;"But we only learn through a montage in the opening credits how the ""brothers"" split in the course of the long years and the experiences - and have to come to terms with it."

negative;P.S: Fears of his childhood???

negative;112 minutes - pretty colorful but not rousing.

negative;Especially the resolution is so lousy that you could have told the movie in 10 minutes!

negative;A few small and great ideas like the Chinese woman were there.

negative;But it flattens out like that.

negative;For me, the scenes with the cab driver were positive, they wait partly really funny and NoÃ©mie Lenoir was a feast for the eyes.
