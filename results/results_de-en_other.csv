negative;negative;unfortunately, not quite.
negative;positive;a masked killer caught the family, only the little daughter seems to be hidden somewhere and so arkin decides to help her.
positive;positive;above all, however, stand omar sharif, whom i consider one of the best actor of his time.
negative;positive;back to the weeds.
negative;negative;the fact that the film ha rightly not received a gold boy is due to the large part of it, in my opinion, to the script from whichever source is also oscarnominated.
negative;positive;however, the alien themselves are not mentioned in the film.
positive;positive;"""man of steel"" is a pure action spectacle."
positive;positive;"a far a the film music of thomas newman is concerned, he return in ""skyfall"" rather back to the root of 007 and thus put u in the classic bond feeling."
positive;positive;the first 2\3thirds of the film are absolute world class, creating an absolutely captivating tension.
positive;positive;this is because the film is based on true events.
positive;positive;just perfect i find the movie totally good!!
positive;positive;"in order to get his son ""home"", thomas set out for france."
negative;negative;hello, we also watched the movie because it wa greatly hyped.
negative;negative;bravely, bibi enters a a substitute player, naturally score a few point and - of course - get older, because a girl can certainly only make point if she ha hexed.
negative;positive;in general, the whole movie is full of bombast action and breathtaking special effecs that really doesn't have to hide from the competition.
positive;positive;in combination with the recorded comment of various radio and tv commentators, the viewer creates a real racing feeling, even if these scene sometimes seem a little unintelligible.
negative;negative;and the story wa more than laughable.
negative;positive;the light from the ice surface wa directed towards the passage running towards them, where nancy kerrigan wept bitterly.
positive;positive;the criticism is very appropriate (even if it is very spoiling!
negative;positive;i wa incredibly impressed by that.
negative;positive;the only thing left is q who want to bring humanity back to justice:-) this film is the proof that star trek is better than star wars!
negative;positive;that's why there wa plenty of room for action, and a robert downey jr.
negative;negative;sigourney weaver play her character a usual super, but unfortunately he ha hardly anything to do with the replay, which you could only admire after the first 3 parts.
positive;positive;an absolute firework of special effects.
positive;positive;of course also an absolutely predictable love story must not be missing.
negative;negative;furthermore, the end is disheartened on the whole line: everything suddenly take a good end – naturally completely surprising – that no one could have guessed...
negative;positive;perfectly flummed and staged re-launch of the series, in which even the humor in the just right dose is not missing - we can look forward to more!
negative;positive;music only occurs when someone in the film turn on the radio or the turntable.
positive;positive;in the whole a very good comedy, which you should definitely look at.
positive;negative;if two more film are filmed, that won't be enough.
positive;negative;to squeeze it out in school notes: it is a if you had first written a 2, then a 4 and finally also a 6!
negative;positive;but who fan and a a small child already could inspire for the two monkeys^^ will be completely satisfied!
negative;negative;the film is by no mean weak, but not more than average.
negative;positive;nevertheless, i had to grin almost continuously about this genius, especially charly drew me into his spell.
negative;positive;==references====external links==
negative;positive;however, this topic made sense in the endeavor of bond film according to the possibility to offer up-to-date time.
positive;positive;the vocal inlay are excellent, stinging through a co-reisende staging.
positive;positive;even if praunheim a in many of his other film is also present here a a protagonist, so in the course of the film this becomes increasingly incidental.
positive;positive;absolute highlight of course the final showdown against the devil himself.
positive;positive;both film have their reason for being, a the opening of the story conveys a completely different feeling.
negative;negative;"only a few ""highlights"" (i can only call them because of the fact that the rest of the film is just fad) such a marcellus's saying (""i'm working on you with a solder lamp"") or butches' saying (""i'm an american, there name don't have a deeper sense"") save the film for me personally from the total crash."
positive;positive;the darker atmosphere and especially the absolutely grandiose performance of the two young actors.
negative;positive;ignorants!
negative;positive;unbeliever have no bible knowledge.
negative;negative;unfortunately, it doesn't play in the cinema anymore, but it's really great!
positive;negative;the end also very good!
negative;negative;2.
negative;positive;sure, he's not everybody's business, but anyone who stand on movie like the wedding crasher or the classic fear and loathing in la vega will certainly be laughing at this movie.
positive;negative;even i a a woman must confess that the men in the film are kept very small.
negative;positive;e.g. snapes reminder or harry and dumbledore in the entrance hall to the beyond... for that the film took time, and that wa a very big plus!
negative;negative;i mean, seymour didn't even get the chance to show off.
positive;negative;"""the sensitive chris would break up at the break-up and yet he can't help but continue to work for mccauley and indulge in gambling addiction."""
positive;negative;film-noirish to hitchcockmã1⁄4g, worth a look, though none of the very big bringers from his time.
negative;positive;it's not a good idea.
negative;positive;also they were not so much convinced by the still unknown al pacino.
positive;positive;the film is shot at a remarkable pace.
positive;negative;even though the actor performance wa partly solid, the film wa not saved.
negative;negative;the idea is also good looking.
negative;negative;the hint to the end, what could have happened to jimmy, throw then any message, which the whole movie long before long breathed wa propagated again over the pile.
negative;negative;all in all, a tedious, boring movie (and we had not expected any action or similar).
positive;negative;in my opinion, partly yes, but there's still air up there.
positive;positive;but with harry, i'm out of my mind.
negative;negative;that, in my opinion, is the worst work of tim burton.
negative;negative;the movie is soooo bad.
positive;positive;big movie theater what awaits you here!
positive;positive;thanks peter!
negative;positive;fan should not miss the edit ulysses cut.
positive;positive;at the same time, burton, however, in his own way would like to bring old-fashioned horrofilms and brings gothic, loud and bloody horror to the screen, especially in the opening scene a well a in the apocalyptic showdown.
negative;positive;at @andreas now calm down again, okay?!
negative;negative;5.
negative;negative;"in addition, it doesn't seem so overloaded stupid and cheap a with ""batman v superman""."
positive;positive;after jurassic world i try again a a film critic.
negative;positive;thus, the father figure would be much more than a disguised alien - the incarnation of a being that ha access to all the thought and idea that ever existed in the universe (or, even more metaphysical: a being that, a a kind of world spirit, encapsulates all these thought and ideas).
positive;positive;again and again indication appear, which he cannot interpret.
negative;negative;"both of them don't work together and the result is such a bumpy screenplay disaster a in the last ""007-films""."
negative;positive;this is basically quite simple (at least nothing really new), but delayed and somewhat chaotically told, so that the spectator is kept in a spell.
negative;positive;this movie is just class he is the first in the series that is always thirsty and doe not try to make everything a child-friendly a possible why he is one of the best of the series
positive;positive;i think this film is awesome because it speaks out many thing he everyone ha in himself, it is very strongly inspired by the manga and the anime, which is rare in film adaptation of the kind.
positive;positive;i also love problem films, film noir and similar, but: this is loose, airy, casual.
positive;positive;one of the best film by takashi miike not a pure action film but rather an action drama: a worth seeing film that hollywood can never shoot
negative;negative;the film is very calm, but then increase until it loses tension again after some time.
positive;negative;i'll stay with the books.
negative;positive;leave this movie where it is!
positive;positive;and the new death slow is the best action movie i've seen in the last few years.
positive;positive;great!
negative;negative;this is now a big negative point.
negative;negative;"the teacher's dramatic gesture and final rhetoric just before the end doe not fit in with the much too short and much to ""simple"" development."
negative;positive;there is not too much action but also not too little, everything very balanced.
positive;negative;side-by-side.
positive;negative;also temporary impotence with superheroes is thematized, here should be shown u that the man is deeply controlled by his vulnerable psyche and under circumstance a latex-kostã1⁄4m with action-prelude to increase his manhood necessary.
negative;negative;"so that one get to hear then in the hanebüchenden finale also such completely rã¶tselhaft attribute like ""family"" and ""friends"" to hear."
positive;positive;a in almost every of burton's productions, the environment (as well a the actor through their specially designed exterior) seems almost surreal and thus very mysterious.
positive;positive;the film is continuously exciting and provides with a light breeze healthy humor for some laughs.
negative;positive;unfortunately, i noticed some time negatively because the first meeting at the airport is simply overplayed although i can't imagine the godzilla would let this escape so easily or the mato wa out on the same.
negative;positive;if then one like him is suddenly nominated for a golden globe, one listens already.
positive;positive;the staging is captivatingly precise, the film over 2 hour not only exciting, but also emotionally gripping.
positive;positive;he show what war make of people and how it change them.
positive;negative;even if the acting performance of the two main character is still so good, the film itself is not.
negative;negative;the charm of a terence hill a well a some interesting side character let me watch the movie completely and made the experience more than lost time.
positive;negative;"in this film, 80% of the film took the said ""starting phase""."
positive;positive;it's worth seeing.
negative;positive;i hope for more parts.
negative;positive;even 24 hour after looking, i think back again and again.
positive;positive;"star war would not be star war without ""the return of the jedi knights"" and all three part are, a it were, the best film of all time."
negative;negative;you can't be serious.
negative;negative;elysium on the other hand: cliché, banality, unexciting.
positive;positive;the picture are impressive and very meaningful, the star convince in their role a four drug-dependent individuals, who go towards their demise.
negative;negative;density plot, suspense, action and an outstanding lead actor.
negative;negative;the film play in the year 2035, the protagonist are already in the middle 30, but besides smith often doe not want any clue what happened in the 2000s, very unrealistic!
positive;negative;both very original and funny.
negative;positive;hello i can not sit differently: the film is a classic.
negative;negative;so, if i want a well-staged chase, i'm looking at the classic like bullitt, ronin and also taxi 1 from me, but this is really just bad.
negative;negative;"in the run-up, i read thing like ""virtual masterpiece"" or ""a 3d experience"" and thought to myself the film is certainly not that bad."
positive;positive;funny remake with a cool cast and a lot of joke!
positive;positive;my tip: go there, look forward to stubborn winegrowers who love their land and their vines.
negative;positive;when i suddenly realized that josh hartnett wa doing something together with bruce willis and wa on a merciless revenge campaign, i wa more than convinced of hartnett's portrayal.
negative;positive;"after reading the reviews, i'm surprised which polarization spotial is apparently ""sin city""."
negative;positive;but up to this point the movie wa easier only great, and know to inspire with many stromberg typical laughs!
positive;negative;of course, the image of the male role and female role (unfortunately) is almost still so everywhere, but a slightly different view on it would have been already good.
negative;positive;yes, the story press on the trance - but in a positive sense.
positive;positive;"two further change are also based on taste criticism: on the one hand, the new â€"" better â€"" special effects."
positive;positive;the two convince a enemies, partner-reciprocal will but also a first sign of sympathy between the figure flash up.
positive;positive;especially jonathan rhys meyers and scarlett johanson!
negative;positive;doesn't matter there otherwise heart, feel ect.
positive;negative;i wanted a little brainless action and got what i expected.
positive;positive;you're always reminded that it's fiction.
negative;negative;nothing!
positive;positive;overall, i left the cinema hall in spite of higher expectation satisfied and with desire for more.
negative;positive;the film strengthens an incredible mood, a bloody freedom, between danger and omnipotence fantasies, a if de palma had filmed gta in the eighty - only without the open end, but with the logical consequence, the insane scream, which echo so long, until out of the mouth no more words, but blood.
negative;negative;put everything there that run wrong in the modern medium world.
negative;positive;"about ""psycho"" everything ha already been said what need to be said."
negative;negative;still one lives.. in my opinion would then perhaps someone noticed that it is only a bad game..would only be logical or?
positive;positive;story, humor, actor, logic, red thread etc. for me a milestone in film history and probably the best movie i've seen so far!
positive;positive;the ability to immerse yourself in a fantastic story and to experience a wonderful fairy tale...!
positive;positive;the film confirms in all respect that also the foreign iridian can develop further and adapt to the present time.
negative;positive;step up wa a very nice drama in which a street boy with the prima ballerina becomes a super pair.
positive;positive;"with ""following"" christopher nolan ha succeeded in a really excellent noir thriller, which radiates a very special atmosphere precisely because of it low-budget production."
positive;positive;if you're a tmnt fan.
negative;positive;and it wa breathtaking.
positive;positive;one of the saddest.
negative;negative;hardly tension, extremely stupid character and an incredible story
negative;negative;the dialogue were unfortunately often flat and unconnected, a few of them unexpectedly clever.
negative;negative;even a few more into the air-scattered gravestone then the whole thing would be a little more exciting.
positive;positive;a (not necessarily new) but very well implemented story, filled with great actors.
negative;negative;a collection of uninteresting person (type of bull stallion), entangled in a spun constructed case, which also doe not bring much.
positive;positive;i have to say that the german/austrian cinema (weingartner is more or le rich) can surprise me again and again.
positive;positive;every single film a small masterpiece - connected only by the theme, the love - and the city that give the film the title.
negative;positive;"conclusion: ""hostiles"" is hard, sad, extremely tiresome, calm, unsparing and leaf one still before the credits."
positive;negative;actors' performance are solid, no outlier up or down.
positive;positive;it is to be said that it is perhaps the best star war part that life through the humanity of the individual character, the old flair and the new story about power.
positive;positive;the bottom line is the thing from another world is a creepy, exciting, bloody and action-packed splatter shocker old school that let you freeze the blood in your veins.
negative;positive;the jackie chan movie have never had a great or deep story â€ , this one neither.
positive;positive;beautiful that there are still such film with such cast!
negative;negative;too often and never well filmed.
positive;positive;even if the film is technically not outstanding, it ha interesting dialogue & brings you to think.
negative;positive;especially the point, one know how it really was, but if one imago the situation from the point of view of an inhabitant, wouldn't one have exactly these prejudices?
positive;positive;good call!
negative;positive;what wa very beautiful wa where the bright coffin wa opened and the clearing had such a beautiful light.
negative;positive;"but one thing clearly show ""the wild bunch"": violence fascinates above all else."
negative;positive;atmosphã¤re: here the film score on the whole line!
negative;positive;i don't want any of you ever to come into such a situation and sell your soul.
negative;positive;the opening scenario must swallow the audience like sandra's pills.
positive;positive;"in any case, this film is a very successful spectacle, which not only make up the perfected visual style, but also that this story is exciting, creative and very nice to harmonize with the matching black/white, so that a very horny mood arises and maintains a certain kind of ""sin city"", but there is a bit more comic in it, which should not have a negative effect on this movie or even on ""sin city""."
positive;positive;i've seen the film in new zealand in english.
negative;negative;but for what also, the figure are so and so only empty sleeves.
negative;positive;because what we see today a a succession of high-grade clichés wa born here!
positive;positive;while the machine around them reproduce the documents, they have something unique.
negative;positive;the story is very thin.
negative;positive;"""into the abyss"" is more appropriate."
negative;negative;the action go through just a much though far too little of it is shown.
negative;positive;there are no real lengths, the soundtrack is fantastic, you will simply 111 minute really well entertained.
negative;positive;on the other hand, a version with a dissolving twist might be too classic and not a artful.
positive;positive;in the leading role nicolas cage, very well done (!
positive;positive;conclusion: really worth seeing funny comedy
negative;positive;the light, loose staging a well a the naturally sloppily (but not unlevelless) theme worry that one and a half hour a in flight pas and you also have to laugh about the more often (with the scene in the kinsey family sitting at dinner and kinsey discussing detailed sex topic with woman and child is so terrible that you want to sink under the table).
positive;positive;the night shot are very exciting, whereby it is mainly the own expectation attitude, which allows one to freeze in the cinema seat.
negative;negative;in the end, he's the hero.
positive;negative;the good old game which the camera doe not show, you don't see / hear either!
negative;negative;unfortunately, the film is not particularly convincing in it style.
positive;positive;what emerges on the screen are dream fantasies, vision and illusions.
positive;positive;you should definitely look at it.
negative;negative;tomb raider from roar uthaug is trying to make lara croft a normal young woman and i have to say that i find this completely bland in a jump-and-run action cracker.
negative;positive;i have the film and can judge it better for me.
negative;negative;==references====external links==
positive;positive;"i saw ""looking for eric"" yesterday in the sneak and can say that the film-starts-critic ha captured this film very well."
negative;positive;the actor completely convince.
negative;negative;there are quite some good gag and allusions, but above all there is lack of tension, which i still felt in the preview films: never the preparation of the robbery seriously in danger, every problem is quickly solved, serious antagonist are missing.
positive;positive;of course, a special, filmic emulation effort is provided for this.
positive;positive;"i also think that word of mouth ultimately is much more positive than the ""official"" criticism did at the beginning."
negative;positive;the 'murder' who are actually 'suicides' are anything but ingenuity gorehappen.
negative;negative;"at friday night light there wa only one question at the end, wa the \""based on a true event\"" at the beginning the legitimation for an unspectacular movie?"
positive;positive;of horror film there is a wide range.
negative;positive;episode 1 wa great and episode 3 wa great.
negative;negative;so we have a lot of clichés in action, adventure and romance.
negative;negative;"especially creepy were mainly not the ""shock"" moments, but the logic holes."
negative;positive;why wasn't matt damon arrested at the funeral?!
negative;positive;overall, i am more than satisfied with the result, even if it might not be so.
positive;positive;so the two of them set out to the far north and it's all different than expected.
positive;positive;the actor are convincing in their role, something that in such a film necessarily belongs to it and is important.
negative;negative;known actor in a gangster comedy where the certain something is missing.
positive;positive;"anyone who is otherwise afraid to be tormented with the depiction of mass murder a in ""blood diamond"", is hereby reassured."
negative;positive;a father who absolutely want to fight is like a lion for his children, and it get tough because dad ha nothing else to sell.
positive;positive;of course, the african culture is interwoven in the film.
positive;negative;blöd, a i find it, is then also still, if mann this film style still mixed with high-gloss shots, which atmospheric could not be more atmospheric.
positive;positive;the representation of the picture are also a class for itself.
negative;positive;normally, i'm so cold, but i'm not in the movie.
positive;positive;"a very good film, which show simply the real reality in the largest camorra quarter of naples; there reign the highest drug use worldwide, all drug addict from the region come there by bus!"
negative;positive;and here, too, there have been great fluctuations.
negative;positive;only the end didn't quite promise me.
negative;positive;"just in advance : michael bay told me nothing- ""the rock"" (pension solidarity surcharge for mr. connery otherwise dull command soldier bullshit) and ""armageddon"" (voluntarily overlaid, unrealistic asteroid hero saga) whereas already."
negative;positive;large breather break are not allowed, a the tension from the evil beginning to the bitter end is held extremely high.
positive;positive;i'm sure tim burton's film aren't everybody's case, but i really liked dark shadows.
positive;positive;but with the bride - ingenious.
positive;positive;sound complicated, so it is in some scenes.
positive;positive;generally, the bridge function between part 1 and 3 wa exemplary.
negative;positive;i have to admit, i guessed a little bit in that direction, but until the penny fell right, it took a while.
positive;positive;also the cast with jake gyllenhall is very suitable in my opinion anch.
negative;negative;however, there are only two of them in the whole film and thus are far from enough to roam around the rudder to create several wow moments.
positive;positive;and tilda swinton - how did you get old, tilda?
negative;positive;only the claustrophobia in such a hollow system is brought over well.
negative;positive;!it's just tol!!!!
positive;negative;if you can look, you don't have to.
negative;positive;or the intersequences during the occlusal lesson at snape.
negative;positive;i wonder what all the critic have ridden so badly.
negative;positive;i just think she's awesome.
negative;positive;style break in which the journalist robert graysmith present a an identification figure.
positive;positive;the driver is a very good movie, because the actor have been carefully selected.
positive;positive;there is absolutely nothing wrong with camera guidance and sound.
negative;negative;e.g.: little heinrich, (the name is already somehow a prejudice) who with hitler's gruesome mask through the area.
negative;positive;the movie is just awesome!
positive;positive;the outrage of mazursky is verbally funny, in english a well a in german, whether this is funny or not against the background of the missed chance to get his brother back!
negative;positive;and a far a the legendary shooting is concerned, i must say that i have probably never seen anything better staged!
negative;positive;gary king life in the past, he can't let go.
negative;positive;it's a pure entertainment movie for not even a whole 90 minutes.
negative;negative;however, he had never done everything, so far he wa only responsible for the beautiful baiser hood camera technology, but here we want to try his ability a a baker/director.
positive;positive;simply brilliant and colossal.
positive;negative;"since ""shaun of the dead"" england ha experienced something like a little horror boom."
negative;negative;the rather interesting story wa ruined by an action overkill.
positive;negative;"those who have never really been interested in good dialogues, interpersonal relationships, character depth and acting performance in a war movie, and who only liked the first 20 minute of ""the soldier james ryan"", will certainly find the film good."
negative;positive;disney's going after him.
negative;positive;it's incredible how much joke, charm and action little ireland can bring!
negative;positive;all this is more or le mouth-appropriate portion from the comics, also prepared for non-connoisseurs understandably and a little le tension.
negative;positive;on the contrary.
positive;positive;elementary particle is to be mentioned in a series with such ingenious new german film a herr lehmann or 23. ok, the film should probably run under fsk-16.
negative;negative;the single when you do not have to bet out or income.
positive;positive;so look successful new episode of a series, carefully develop the figures, introduce a good and matching story and new twist and figure for further episode - which will hopefully exist, with alicia vikander naturally.
positive;positive;"and everyone should always remember: ""we are all steaks!!!"""
positive;positive;thank you.
negative;positive;only the figure drax would not have to be so flat.
negative;positive;they are for me the basic requirement in a good comic.
positive;negative;a not to be expected otherwise, the first part is by far the best!
positive;negative;the film is a self-contained product and must not expect any further requirement from the viewer.
positive;positive;the film is very attached to it original and also surprise with some very good shock moments.
positive;positive;and there you would like to see such film again nowadays, even if you could find hitchcockâ€tms dream of a phone booth setting in â€œnot to hang upâ€œ a few year ago.
negative;positive;but it wa only well-pressed how quickly people will be carried with them every blow of such a thing.
positive;negative;part of it's okay.
positive;positive;kitano play his yakuza role perfectly.
negative;positive;the story ha become really exciting thanks to the script.
negative;positive;the actor warns well, the action super (fingers in the sore), and the special effect did not seem put on a in many other films.
positive;positive;or because many family in hirushima have disabled children, and everything just because america play out a world police ..
negative;positive;the film never loses respect for the character shown and refrain from evaluating it protagonists.
positive;positive;"conclusion: ""sweeney todd"" is a film, far away from the mainstream and very unconventional."
positive;positive;but when you see the film you are often really excited.
positive;positive;the music is a always with a star war movie mega good, but frankly i lacked this main music of star wars.
negative;positive;a a result, bigelow doe not stage like an activision developer and doe not write boal like trivialliterat dan brown.
negative;positive;however, reynold's variant doe not lack individuality, instead of wanted love stories, the uncertain situation in the roman province is in the foreground here.
positive;positive;i recommend this film to everyone: it is an important part of the history of the third reich (alongside all the crime committed), which everyone should also know.
positive;positive;"""similarly ingenious a the predecessor."
positive;positive;still, more of it!
negative;positive;he meet the young yuri, who life by a river with her husband off the village, and recognizes his missing friend in the husband.
negative;positive;but then kenai meet the little cuddly bear koda who is looking for his lost mother.
negative;positive;==references==
positive;positive;until question such a â€œwhere do you come from?â€œ and â€œwhat do you want here?â€œ can be brought to the siebenfã1⁄4er and dr. bank can come into the use of a certain gift, a lot of time passes, but at villeneuve - a usual - without boredom.
negative;positive;the idea wa innovative and brilliantly implemented.
positive;positive;the film ha a tpyan episode film concept (which resembles that of magnolia), a rather quiet film tempo and many cliché-laden characters.
negative;negative;the last point, however, is that i could hardly recognize any film music that could contribute to a bearing epic effect in term of visual events.
positive;positive;the film is part of a classic road movie.
negative;negative;there's nothing more to expect.
negative;positive;otherwise, it'd be kind of stupid, wouldn't it?
negative;positive;you just have to get in there, he's got everything a movie needs.
positive;positive;exciting, feeling, funny, witty and super characktere!
negative;positive;it's hard to tell what's brilliant about the movie and why i value it so high.
negative;positive;"but tarantino's latest work not only unites the force from ""reservoir dogs"", ""pulp fiction"" and ""kill bill"", it also show completely new things."
positive;positive;just like the special effects: nothing superior but ok.
negative;positive;roadmovies get something magical when they're done well.
negative;positive;it contains the synchro of the series, which in my opinion is much more sympathetic than the old (even if it wa not bad).
negative;negative;too bad!!!!!!!
positive;positive;the film is rather trivial and nothing seems to be close to horror, but it gradually develops into an extremely perceptive and poignant psycho thriller, whereby at the end of the movie one want to rage and immediately intervene in the plot.
positive;positive;"i personally found that ""das bourne vermächtnis"" is a successful film.although the film ha a few flaws, but which action film doesn't have it?"
negative;positive;klar santi is not maradonna and anyone who kick can do it the same (or almost*gg*) a he but is not about it.
negative;positive;in war, the murderer becomes a hero.
negative;negative;unfortunately, the development of the character is not a successful a in the first part.
negative;positive;the start is the target.
positive;negative;i loved the atmosphere and logic of this science fiction universe.
negative;positive;despite all the reviews, i have to say, the film is very worth seeing.
positive;positive;the rough and partly dreary beauty of the highlands.
negative;negative;sorry but the movie is just bad!
positive;positive;in addition, the film doe not have pop culture reference and life from it semi-wisdom quiet, otherwise unobtrusive and cute humor.
negative;negative;in short, i decided to go into the movie and then decide how i felt about the new style.
negative;negative;the spectator can't get into it properly, the character at once seem quite superficial and besides, there's not much to admire outside of the beautiful environment.
positive;positive;so i found the film quite well done, but is much better implemented by the plot like the red flood.
positive;positive;those who like humor and action strip will get their money's worth.
negative;positive;the character act so comprehensible and are so powerless.
negative;positive;for 9/10?
negative;positive;my potential doubt about the graphic of the hfr 3d were swept away and suffocated in the bud.
negative;positive;in some place one feel the impotence of this father, when he seems to bounce off at authority or entire judicial systems, a on an impenetrable wall.
negative;positive;i mean the harmless movie turn from the entertainment movie into a, while looking closer thinner fable.
positive;positive;- realism, dirtyness and coolness.
positive;positive;jimi is just great!in the first part he wa good, in the second he wa better and in the third best!the wild guy are at all simply coooooooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive;negative;what's he trying to tell u and show us?
positive;positive;a single fate though, but representative and symbolic for many others.
negative;negative;the gangster comedy is really nothing special.
positive;negative;so, guys, please enjoy it with caution.
negative;positive;"in the eternal comparison between ""goodfellas"" and ""casino"" i take a stand for the candidate, which i also noticed when looking again at ""casino""."
negative;positive;the description look like a lot.

negative;positive;robert downey jr.
negative;negative;the only thing that can damage is possibly the scene in which dastan jump in time or the good panoramic images.
negative;positive;ten point from me!!
negative;positive;the movie just doesn't get bored.
negative;positive;at last nothing is held back.
negative;positive;the camera work know how to please, but - this is probably due to the low budget - hardly an outstanding picture.
negative;positive;i found the movie very good.
positive;positive;human, romantic, realistic and dreamlike about mimic and gestures.
positive;positive;kylo, on the other hand, is like anakin skywalker, who like to freak out and is still afraid.
negative;negative;for me, the film is simply a loose, unspectacular plot with lot of blood, which is probably the only thing that should attract the viewer.
positive;positive;"a western comedy for friend of the rather harsh humor; 60 spaghetti western meet 90ssplattermovie meet 70s-exploitation."
positive;negative;but also here bay play his cards.
positive;positive;the role of the author is outstandingly portrayed by sir michael caine.
negative;positive;at first a with most thriller everything start harmless but on the high point it becomes really actionreich.
positive;negative;in some setting i almost fell asleep and that, although i'm not usually a movie closeer.
positive;negative;it is technically good, the effect are worth seeing, the actor a class above the script.
negative;positive;==references====external links==
positive;positive;an absolute sci-fi masterpiece.
negative;negative;why is kylo ren a joker?
negative;positive;"for a long time no one ha been so gorgeously mean, and his character and his appearance a well a his motivation resemble the one of prince nuada from ""hellboy 2 - the golden army""."
negative;positive;although at first it wa difficult for me to think into the film, because it play long before my time ^-^ and then also in france.
negative;positive;so the movie wa good.
negative;negative;conclusion: laues lã1⁄4ftchen with unsympathetic main character!
negative;positive;he looked a little cheap, though, had only a marginal appearance.
negative;positive;in my opinion, almost everything in the movie fits.
negative;negative;if then to the end men with dog and in love couple run wild through the bet, with the aim unknown is emotionally already lost all hope.
negative;negative;gosling, which i really like to see, remains pale and show the whole movie about actually almost only one and the same facial expression.
negative;positive;forget jason statham this movie surpasses every movie he has!
positive;positive;fan of denzel washington will get their money's worth.
negative;positive;i actually went with no big expectation of the movie, because i had never heard of the movie before.
negative;negative;157 minute of high tech scrap in gamer format are a single insult to the completion of this trilogy.
negative;positive;watcher or players, give risky task or take risk to u to win money.
negative;positive;so lovingly made, and only this synchronisation, .... that only strike you at the higher age, which meaning nevertheless this grandiose synchronisation bore ... great class, my child i will show this movie at any time also sometime , ha !
negative;positive;the only thing that shocked me wa the end because it wasn't really about the book but that doesn't have to be bad... anyway it's worth watching the movie in the cinema !!
negative;negative;above all, this is simply because the production had far too little time.
positive;positive;his son understands, the daughter doesn't.
positive;positive;had a few leg and christoph waltz seemed occasionally involuntarily funny.
positive;positive;tja it wa not a revelation. it wa a masterpiece what david o russel put down there. shame that he did not win an oscar. the story is really good and the show-pilerric performance is also ingenious criminal film or comedy whatever that is just recommended.
negative;positive;"underworld, resident evil, etc. also have no ""cruel moments""."
positive;positive;tim burton hit again.
negative;negative;the action doe not even reach the level of the first two parts.
positive;positive;and both together make it happy.
positive;positive;the humor seems sometimes emboldened and tense and also no longer clearly funny.
positive;positive;"but it wa also a bit funny that the mother justin constantly addressed with ""scarts"" or ""favorite"", a if he were her son."
negative;positive;i did not read a book by sherlock holmes before and did not continue to deal with this person.
negative;negative;his â€ ¬¶sewichtâ€ is more than overexhaustible, he would actually have been able to be completely removed from the film.
negative;positive;"what i particularly liked about ""phantastic animal being and where to find them"" wa the first half of the film when the viewer wa overwhelmed with surprises."
negative;positive;after reading most of the review here in the forum, i found that most people here are dissatisfied with the fact that the film is not very close to the book.
negative;negative;built in 1950 and 1954.
positive;positive;"all in all, ""the state enemy no. 1"" is a really captivating and gripping high-voltage thriller that remains exciting until the last minute!"
negative;positive;then he go down to his old department.
positive;positive;"inside hollywood with robert deniro or sofia coppola's latest work ""the bling ring"", hollywood apparently try to give insight into the world of stars."
positive;positive;film art and acting excellence.
negative;negative;the movie offer a lot of action and car chases, but that alone is not enough for me.
negative;negative;the film wa really nice to see that the budget wa drastically shortened against the previous one.
positive;positive;even a a police officer one can devote only the best praise to the film, i hope, lisa wagner still often ha the possibility to deliver such a thing.
negative;negative;the character in this movie could also be porn actor without honor code see raping scene.
negative;positive;what is only very important is to let the animal live in their peace a well.
negative;positive;all of this is based on a 16 volume comprehensive book series, so there is a lot of material available to let this movie figure go into a long series.
negative;positive;anna would be well advised to listen to her skeptical uncle, who would encourage the dead to bury their dead.
negative;positive;only i would like to say that there are very drastic reduction that are difficult to digest, which lead to the fact that it is not a normal love drama.
positive;positive;the optic is also the hammer again and the effect even more.
negative;positive;really very cordial.
positive;positive;i love christian bale.....he's just great....and i love christopher nole....he just make great movies.....the story is made like for cinema.....fantastico
negative;positive;if you're allowed to be a patriot, i guess it's in these cases.
negative;positive;8/10
negative;negative;but to convince the ideas.
negative;negative;i can't remember much more, but i also had to force myself to do the 1.5 hours.
negative;positive;however, communication problem are the central theme of babel, which already give rise to the title, which refers to the tower of babel.
negative;negative;"i looked at ""hitch"" in the movie a few week ago and found it rather boring."
negative;positive;but only until then.
positive;positive;first cream.
positive;positive;abrams surpasses himself with the second part and you only wait eagerly for his next project - star war 7
positive;positive;ok, i still find the main character still rotten, but also this time the penguin are the secret star (doesn't least because they are again spoken of by the fantastic 4).
positive;positive;so i have to honestly say that this wa one of the best movie in recent years.
positive;positive;:-) is it a women's movie?
negative;positive;although i had to hold my ear (and also my eye in some scenes) with every second word that the actor gave me, the film nevertheless inspired me.
positive;positive;however, i found it very good, but also somehow very sad in some places.
negative;positive;...when i read the last comment here.
positive;positive;black-and-white image with sharp contrast and crazed colour swab a well a the perfect camera work, which would have earned an oscarnomination, make each individual setting a small work of art.
negative;negative;i have to say that pig is actually only side-by-side and can well also be completely omitted.
positive;negative;i can see this more neutrally: it's just a cinematic spinning over a funny chew that make it surroundings palpable with it blooming imagination.
positive;positive;thank you!
negative;positive;cameron diaz is incredibly serious and professional.
negative;negative;not only that many owl simply look too much, but rather the inexplicable multiplicity of the forest are easy to overlook.
positive;negative;some nice effect and that's it.
positive;positive;exciting and lively film..... definitely recommended!
positive;negative;only worthwhile on the film are the few, but impressive large shot of the island of iwo jima while it is shot by the american (great special effects).
negative;positive;sarimaus
negative;positive;"however, i only gave 9 because some scene are quite unfaithful (why do the trojan not just stay behind their ""strong walls""??"
negative;negative;greetings?
positive;positive;then, contraryly, one put oneself in the rage of the tortured and would like to call her a kellen.
positive;positive;great soundtrack and excellent played and staged
negative;negative;the personalized body is back again and doe once again what it apparently can best: against a meanwhile fifth-class (?!)
negative;negative;he's just not an actor.
negative;positive;(b) the following shall be added to the list of product listed in annex i to regulation (ec) no 1107/2009:
positive;positive;it's just wonderful.
negative;negative;but i would have expected a little more or one would have been able to get more out of the basic idea of the film!
positive;positive;in 90 minute an exchange year, with all obstacles, problem but also joy and satisfaction, is presented in a very entertaining way.
negative;positive;but that pay off pretty well in the end.
positive;negative;in just such is found a certain style will and atmosphere.
negative;positive;"the ""standard interpreation"" of the dream is not enough for me."
negative;positive;rather, he strictly establishes an interpersonal story in an environment that doe not seem so fictional to the viewer.
negative;negative;action scene are then moved over, a long a their bond seems cool.
positive;positive;during the dealer's visit to the film, the socio-critical aspect of the film come into the background, and the trashy fun of unbecoming action is let loose.
negative;positive;- a few spoilers_ whereby i find that you can spoil this movie without harming him.
negative;positive;i wa from the 1st century.
negative;positive;i rarely recommend movies, a i find most for absolutely stupid and boring.
negative;positive;for le is luke hunted, but must rather see how one opposes him and shuts himself off.
negative;positive;"only after hangover i saw then ""brüno"", which i found strangely funny (i know it is certainly not everybody's humor, but mine already), therefore for a short time this wa the best comedie, until yesterday = zack & miri have shown me!"
positive;positive;also diane kruger and justin bartha with his marked oneliners play top.
positive;negative;the actual story deal however with a war tragedy and with it effect on the bereaved.
negative;positive;after i've walked about 500 meters, i see them, huge monsters.
negative;negative;after that it is fortunately better, but never achieves the intensity of the predecessor.
negative;positive;after i drove 180 km last weekend to see this film, which i find very regrettable on the one hand, the special character of the film on the other side by the traditional charm of that light play house far from cinestar and co.
positive;positive;joss whedon is a genius!
positive;positive;a previously mentioned, the story is quite good and consistently interesting.
negative;positive;"you don't have to say much more about this movie than ""wayans brothers"" !!!"
negative;negative;because this aspect ha unfortunately been pushed far too much into the center.
positive;positive;), the incredibly sympathetic characters, the great music, the exuberant cheerfulness that the film conveys â€¢ oh damn, i won't find the right word to logically express why the movie mean so much to me, i just recommend it to everyone, even if most of them will dismiss it only a a completely insignificant comedy!conclusion: for me the best, most early and most versatile party comedy ever!
positive;positive;especially josh brolin you see in the cinema more and more and he ha an extremely high presence.
negative;positive;i saw him once, i saw him twice... crazy movie.
negative;positive;sam raimi's original wa a real horror cult movie in my generation.
negative;positive;this movie show me again why batman is my favorite comic hero.
positive;positive;his story captivates with gripping and interesting twist which often appear unexpectedly and thus give the film a lot of effect.
negative;positive;or, everyone believed the casino royale with daniel craig can only get bad.
positive;negative;hi, everybody. i've seen t3 since yesterday.
positive;positive;only very rarely doe a film manage to bring it statement so aptly, unobtrusively and entertainingly to the screen like â€ždallas buyer clubâ€œ: a fundamental plenipotentiary for more tolerance, more self-determination, but above all for more humanity.
negative;positive;if you expect a thriller story or horror effects, you should stay away from this movie.
positive;positive;hicks, too, ha changed significantly in the last year and he ha become more mature, how should it be different, and ha to accept himself so easily that he will step in the footstep of his father, but really become friends, he still can't.
negative;negative;every now and then there are a few good laughs, but in the whole it is unfortunately in limits.
negative;positive;to the first point: i do not need to explain here to anyone the genius and the prominent influence of the director on the posterity.
negative;positive;unfortunately, i can't say anything about the synchornization, because i only got the original dvd from the usa.
positive;positive;this go in some important scene quite clearly at the expense of the emotionality and the empathic feeling.
negative;positive;especially pleased me the young tãã1⁄4rke burak.
positive;negative;if you're not a rocky fan, the movie won't bring you anything.
negative;positive;"if mcclane make one by one of his people down, and make him white with a few drink (or should bring them) stir up with this actor who encapsulates thomas gabriel just nothing... he doesn't build up anti-sympathy, nothing, the opponent of mcclane you have always hated somehow, especially at 1 +3 rickman and iron were great, but this olyphant is just bad and his whole ensemble is also, also the ""asia"" tante is completely boring or just boring...a pity, because good opponent are fundamentally important for a good hero."
positive;negative;all in all, some kind of pseude teen love drama you don't have to see.
negative;positive;better and more emotional it would not have been able to be implemented.
positive;positive;so who argues so, ha seen the film only to half?!
negative;positive;bomb film but probably the worst syncronization of all time.
positive;positive;you just can't hold the tears...
negative;positive;the film show a decadent world, which one neither understands nor want to understand a a normal citizen.
positive;positive;the film is peace and it show u every minute, even if it throw u into a battle between japanese and american, pantheism always pleads for peace in the film!
negative;negative;or quite classical david against goliath.
negative;positive;he make me smile, even grin, but never loses a certain claim and from time to time he make me very thoughtful, just to make me smile again.
positive;positive;the complex plot is charged with the rousing and symphonic music of nightwish, which lends poetry and beauty to darkness.
positive;positive;i hope that the film reach and teach many people.
negative;positive;i don't like it, but they fit here!)
negative;negative;the problem here: if you really want to be brutal in the film, then the blood should also be sprayed properly, then a exaggerated ironic distance to the shown must become clear.
negative;negative;due to a high rating of filmstarts.de, which i usually trust to have a real impact, i did this movie to myself.
positive;negative;i very much hope that 'the purge: election year' (appears this year) will fill up my corners.
positive;positive;depp and carter are great again, a well a the rest of the cast.
negative;positive;single class!
positive;positive;"the scenario of the film reminds one of movie like roland emmerich's ""independence day"", ""the contact"" or spielberg's ""war of the worlds""."
positive;positive;the best films, in my opinion, are the one that manage to create a unique atmosphere.
positive;positive;it's amazing to watch the norwegian film market.
positive;positive;for example, gandalf leaf the travel community for longer time in the book and is silent about his goals.
negative;positive;can't quite get to the second part, but it's not bad either!
positive;positive;my revelation of the film is clearly ken watanabe a dr. ichiro serizawa, who with his scene and view sound like wanting to make election campaign for the greens.
positive;positive;a film, powerful and incisive like hurricane sweeping through an avenue of half rotted trees, a storm of image that won't let go of you for a long time.
negative;positive;"in reality, no one would ever do that."""
negative;positive;i find it could not be awarded better actor for these roles.
positive;positive;see for sure!
positive;positive;who ha already had the good to live successfully and carefree in life from birth.
negative;negative;one must not forget that this is a children's film.the first part ha done much more fun than the 2 and 3. but a with the movie so the sequel mean worse.i would buy it for my child but certainly not for me.
negative;positive;okay, the title isn't exactly the banger, but i still wanted to give the movie a chance.
positive;positive;if that's not enough, let's say that a young talent like mark ruffalo show himself from the best side in this film.
positive;positive;the film give you the feeling of a cult film and is in many place a homage at old blockbuster and classic like e.t.. small length are unfortunately present denoch.
negative;positive;it just fit everything...it's already a work of art to go through the movie so geek-like over 2 hour and never lose the density of entertainment/voltage or comedy.
positive;positive;"yes and sometimes think about his own life with the ""plastic""."
positive;positive;what lie at the end above all on the actor and dances.in this film everything is just right.
negative;positive;!^^,i thought that the movie wa totally long-sighted and so, abba then he wa very good, the romantic place were the coolest!
negative;positive;"""the marriage of the templar knights"" doe his thing however very well!"
negative;positive;"let his pioneer all stirred up and with the same fervour (you can sometimes even see the fire in mccougney's eye directly) like the tech-enthusiastic ""we do this"" â€ ,68 generation start into space and search for the impossible."
negative;positive;unfortunately, the end for me is a bit too flat and therefore 1 star trigger!
positive;positive;excellent also the performance of dicaprio and foxx.
positive;positive;nevertheless, ipman 2 is better than it predecessor.
positive;positive;but here it wa described without kitsch, without pathos, with realistic problem and multi-layered characters.
positive;negative;that a film should somehow get away from the book and go it way can't justify it.
positive;positive;when one of the student finally want to take his life, petra threatens to make the case public.
positive;positive;well, reaching a target group with this work is difficult: child will not understand the irony and side strokes, while older one will be deterred from the child's style of drawing.
negative;positive;therefore, it is not surprising that he rather 'plays' with a guy interesting for him instead of hanging out with the boring gang member and get angry when one take away the toy from him.
positive;negative;but that's a point of view.
positive;positive;â€œphantastic animal being and where they can be foundâ€œ is well implemented, so that we felt right back into the magical world.
positive;positive;and how human that is all.
negative;positive;b) the much too early turnaround in the story, and that already after a little more than half of the film.
positive;positive;"chu manages to catapult a dance firework on the screen through the very convincing leading actor (especially briana evigan a ""andie"" and adam g. sevani a ""moose"") also through the good soundtrack (including timbaland, missy eliott, florida and t-pain)."
positive;positive;"the sound of the film change from exciting over dramatic to funny; each tone sits and this ensures a nice change."
positive;positive;always pre-emptive one like comic film and especially the marvel cinematic universe.
positive;negative;everyone liked the movie.
negative;positive;"he doesn't give the viewer an opinion, but instead let him decide for himself what the viewer really hold in the ""fight"" against such a regime."
negative;positive;"maybe luo xiao hu, the ""black cloud"", love yu jen, but for yu jen this is not true, she fight (or just play around)."
negative;negative;there's no end-time mood here!
positive;positive;because in the medium it's always about tom cruise scientology getting better, etc. you forget about it.
negative;positive;this movie is just awesome.
negative;negative;this movie is o.a.
positive;negative;i look forward to the sequel because of the gritty end, very critical.
positive;positive;very good movie about the difference between evening adventure and fatherland love.
negative;positive;the number of spectator can also be seen worldwide.
positive;positive;all in all a really beautiful comedy!
positive;positive;however, i have a question for all those who have also seen the film: what is in the envelope that dicaprio give the psychologist before he disappears?
negative;positive;no action bulwark is to be expected here.
negative;positive;"i had expected a ""normal"" action film and wa very positively surprised here."
negative;positive;"however, the presentation of the film ha succeeded quite well, even if someone who doe not know the material can hardly understand the threat of a sephiroth or jenovas, because this is illuminated a little too little - absolutely before the actual movie on the bonus dvd ""last order""."
positive;positive;very good film from the 70s!
negative;positive;the character seem so real and although the whole plot could be regarded a something too playful, he spit the cold truth in everyone's face.
negative;negative;the obligatory love cuddle is only an uninspired side action and the end is anything but surprising.
positive;negative;the cinema wa occupied by 30%.
negative;negative;i personally would have wanted me a little more depth, moreover the character could not convince me very much.
negative;positive;in addition, he need blood and at this point larryâ€tms trusted julia come into playâ€¦ you can find the complete review here:
positive;negative;in addition, two excellent actor dress the two main characters.
positive;positive;the film deal with the topic of immigration to the usa very differentiated and intriguing.
negative;positive;however, the action scrape a little bit of the credibility of the plot, when a somewhat treacherous policeman alone can turn off 3 bankers.
positive;positive;the others also throw themselves full lotte into the written word and thus a bitter, hard family drama arises that doe not deliver optical display values, but emotional high points.
positive;negative;youth book adaptation are becoming more and more a genre of their own and, especially this year, they are growing extremely.
negative;positive;in the foreground for humorous inlay is naturally teddybär ted.
positive;positive;now the side show of the story and the seismicity at the beginning of the film give a meaning and contribute to the refinement of jep gambardella.
positive;positive;a successful film with many exciting scenes.
negative;positive;after the nevertheless rather dormant 2.
negative;positive;that's all he said.
negative;negative;the world-renowned mime cannot play out their acting talent at all.
positive;negative;bourn is of course a very good example.
positive;positive;delicate guest and fan of superficial hollywood movie with happyend should make a wide bow around this film due to the partly violent representation of violence and the entire disturbing plot.
positive;positive;have seen the film in austria and am thrilled, although i don't usually make much of classical music
negative;positive;i went into this movie with a lot of prejudices.
positive;positive;in addition, the wonderful, meaningful picture and the strong character are another reason to watch this film.
positive;positive;on the one hand, this would be a very good cast (kevin spacy a lester burnham), an excellent gripping story with many element such a tragedy, drama and funny to satirical components.
negative;negative;talking?
negative;positive;effects?
negative;positive;the refreshing dialogues, which were adapted from the novel by the neurologist lisa genova, also contribute to this.
negative;positive;violent orgies: braindead 120 day of sodom cannibal holocaust cannibal ferox face of dead (all parts, despite fakes) etc violent films: dance of the devil re-animator zombi woodoo day of the dead kill bill etc rightly brutal films: true romance running scared dawn of the dead (2004) etc average brutal films: pulp fiction the blob scream (1+2) schindlerâ ́s list the soldier james ryan dance of the devil 2 etc little violence pan's labyrinth (!)
negative;positive;you can't identify with any of the character that remain very flat outside yuri, his brother and the gunman weisz.
positive;positive;shocking, exciting, top!
positive;positive;all figure allow a look that excludes any sensation of artificiality.
positive;positive;but for all those who want the slope to aesthetic the film is a must and is entertained pompously.
negative;negative;hold a typical straight-lined revenge and confusion strip without surprise with some neat action scenes, bigger story hole and a few very weak dialogues.
negative;positive;3d, high frame rate.
negative;positive;highly recommended insider tip, the movie would have earned in my opinion far more viewers.
positive;positive;zoe â€žannamariaâ€œ saldana (â€žflight of the caribbeanâ€œ) also play a crucial role.
negative;positive;again, no oscar.
positive;positive;"and another thing, filmstarts.de: ""happy gilmore"" is a masterpiece."
positive;positive;the subsequent flight of the protagonist - also great, what do you want to deny?
negative;positive;there are movie that are immediately a classic.
negative;negative;is there any left?
positive;positive;a story with a lot of feeling, pleasure, love, joy and drama.
negative;positive;the hundred-three minute are twice a long!
negative;negative;i always had the feeling that the half wa missing here, which also led to the fact that for almost the entire second act i had no idea what wa actually going on on the screen.
negative;positive;unfortunately, you have no idea at all of good movie and lot of them.
positive;positive;kim basinger in ideal cast.
positive;positive;especially well worked out are the mimic of lions.
positive;negative;of course it is only a short film and of course it is a bit bizarre, but these 30 minute did not address me at all.
positive;positive;the film also show a bit of the history of america.
negative;negative;only from the middle it becomes quite nice.
negative;positive;if the film doesn't like it, it just didn't understand it or with the theme nix am hat the insider know what is meant by the film and what is being criticized by it!
positive;positive;it radiates an aura, a presence.
negative;positive;so from me to all case 8 points.
positive;positive;conclusion: kramer's goal with this film is not in the foreground, but it is there.
negative;negative;it's all just weird.
positive;negative;i give this movie 5 point because some place are drawn into the lengths....
negative;positive;beautiful clear story so, which actually work without much draught and due to the slight irony nevertheless doe not turn into a total trivial work.
positive;negative;and at the end there is still legolas, who seems to have mutated into the over-elf.
negative;positive;the rest of the character are actually only there, get little characterization, but have quite a personality and so all go well, especially since one ha to do with a comic filming.
positive;positive;absolute recommendation.
positive;positive;"our law make it so simple."""
negative;negative;that's it.
positive;negative;"and the consciously set scenes, such a those with his ""producers"" and those with pamela (tells my grandmother that it wa real)."
negative;negative;i also thought the story wa boring.
negative;negative;so the movie is nothing whole and nothing half.
negative;positive;the mental bond to â€tmexcaliburâ€tm or the sleeping drink in â€tmromeo and juliaâ€tm do not at all interfere, but fit well into the picture, which is often held thirsty and thus creates the necessary atmosphere.
negative;negative;i also saw this movie in the sneak.
negative;positive;"for friend of crazy space movies, who do not take their own myth overly seriously, ""valerian"" will prove to be a lucky grip."
positive;negative;the presentation is quite ok, it is a glaring, sun-flooded film that the image â€žromanzeâ€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â â€ â€ â€ â€ â â â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â â â â â â â â â â â€ â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â
positive;positive;it's all about bullock and that's right.
negative;positive;everything's just right in this movie.
negative;positive;i'm more likely to hit the movie, and i wa totally surprised how good it is.
positive;positive;we see a troubled sun and swarming suburbs.
negative;negative;since i had set almost no claim to the film, i also have not been unmasked...but also not surprised.
positive;positive;i find the idea of making a musical out of the fabric great.
positive;positive;garnished with action, great picture and further approach to family, the own self and medical/technical ethics.
positive;positive;but also the uncertainty that he must sense, what may happen next in this atrocious destruction apparatus.
negative;positive;i only saw this and the first rambo part and this one really convinced me.
negative;positive;nor did it surprise me, when i heard the continuation were almost torn apart by the criticism.
negative;positive;unfortunately, in my environment i know only a few who know how to protect this movie.
positive;positive;very cool and magical!!
negative;positive;because such scene it ha actually heartily little here, but nevertheless one get a gänsehautfan fully at it expense.
negative;negative;conclusion: i definitely hoped for more and am therefore already very disappointed.
negative;negative;the main plot of history wa so dazzling that the word would stay away from me.
positive;positive;such a movie is a happy case!
positive;negative;i'd rather look at mary poppins!
negative;positive;a film that i didn't expect very much in the past.
positive;positive;(it is likely that the excessive proportion of sensitivity of some woman should be encapsulated, but this is not particularly advantageous in the face of the apocalyptic threat from the living dead).
negative;negative;that's why the end remains illogical that it's already shouting: spoiler: doe the whole perfidious plan of the underground rest on the fact that the game director is a rebel, all those who were already thick before are under a blanket and the protagonist just at the right moment come up with the idea to shoot an electric arrow at the dome, where then two minute later a flying ship pick up the lady?
negative;negative;however, one reject then nevertheless willingly back, it happens over itself and maybe even against expectation a nice afternoon out of it.
positive;positive;and especially his exaggerated ego with a tendency to self-sustainability and self-confidence, often brings him into trouble.
positive;positive;even in a torture scene, i couldn't resist it, and even though i'm not a fan of movie like saw or hostel.
negative;negative;"then he is on the safe side with gerard butler in ""olympus/london ha fall""."
positive;positive;so this time also on the margin still the happy name choice of the film is to be noticed, which is this time even in the actual a well a metaphorical sense logical.
negative;negative;sure the figure play great but sure figure play edgy.
positive;positive;in addition, he ha shown great courage with the end and set a sign that disney is not just about love stories.
negative;negative;anyway, i would rather pump the money into the video library than go into this movie.
negative;negative;instead of the world of the computer (tron 1) one ha decided to encapsulate a simulated world (ala matrix), but why the hell doe everything have to be so mechanical?
positive;negative;i refer exclusively to han w. geiã1⁄4endörfer's film adaptation of thomas mann's complex mammoth work, which i wa allowed to attend a a pupil of the upper class in the class association in a lichtspielhaus in kassel.
negative;positive;a reboot that made sense for once!
positive;positive;of course everyone ha his own opinion but the special effect and the transformation of the kelia ani to lord vader is simply bombastic!
positive;negative;perlman's still a good figure, but otherwise everything stay pretty pale.
negative;positive;but this is never over and always fit into the situation, it simply result from the action of the person and this is a long-deadened art.
negative;negative;the movie is good, ha it interesting moments, but i have to say: there you can make a lot more of it!
negative;negative;the story in itself sound like a quick action or something like a video game movie in which a troupe of people fight through a utopian train, from compartment to compartment or from level to level.
positive;positive;the positive point of criticism are the absolutely ingenious camera guidance, the impressive backdrop and the absolutely perfect implementation of the story staged on a true event.
positive;positive;due to the appearance of the spaniard and the open question about their function, many possibility are offered to the viewer to finish the film according to his own understanding of the kulur.
negative;negative;have the request of the corresponding editor by the hollywood overkill already fallen so far?
negative;positive;the movie is really mega!!
positive;positive;you also notice to the main actor that they are in their element.
negative;negative;no further development, confused, confused concept of life, desperate fight against age - so woody allen present itself.
negative;positive;the screenplay by director matthew vaughn and jane goldman bubbling over quotes, satirical allusions, reddish dialogues, cool onliners and take all the comic film of the past with crazy and very unusual idea on the brink that you simply don't come out of laughter again.
negative;positive;the idea of such a terrible topic, a the murder of a boy with so much joke to put into effect is really bravely one can assume that there is only a creepy suffering of a movie out of it.
negative;positive;all three leading actor play fabulously.
positive;positive;"a really good movie with many twist and a completely untypical (and just because of that character-strong bondgirl; only the dialogue between 007 and her in the plane - he had depth!)."
positive;positive;this universe of the conquest of urban space in the center of a drama allows florian gaag to analyze graffiti more differentiatedly than this would ever be possible from the distance of the documentary filmmaker.
positive;positive;the music also fit well into the film.
positive;positive;in any case tarantino ha succeeded here a timeless masterpiece, that one should have seen at least once.
positive;positive;i liked it so much and it made a huge fun to follow the movie.
positive;negative;the beginning ha been quite successful and make you want more.
negative;positive;"the united state of the future are degenerated into a surveillance state in which the problem are attempted by the consumption of the novel drug ""substanz d"" (d for death)."
positive;negative;you don't get much smarter than what you learn in class and so the movie is unfortunately below average.
positive;positive;until the final happy end, he ha statistically reduced the crime rate in paris significantly and brought high economic activity to the paris funeral institutes.
negative;positive;here a there is demonstrated a typical, normal morning at a school, one almost willfully and indiscriminately observes scene of a very normal school day which are repeatedly shown from different perspective so that at several intersection the scene repeat themselves (in a scene, for example, a schã1⁄4ler sits on the school toilet and hears a in the neighboring cabin a passing, in the later course givesâ€tms the scene again out of sight of the vomit).
negative;positive;also the conclusion leaf no wish open.
positive;positive;great.
negative;negative;since john rambo, he's really been dating again.
positive;positive;although one can accuse the first battle scene of being arbitrarily motivated in it justification for existence, it clearly show what the raid 2 can do: crazy camera ride in the narrowest space, incredibly dynamic pan and cuts, down to the perfection of movement and ingenious introduction within the fights.
negative;negative;for me only a medium-sized comedy, tension go against zero and the 1.5 hour came to me, exaggerated said a 3 hour ago.
negative;positive;recently, only a few film really impressed me, with which i could guide the plot in front of me the whole evening.
negative;negative;thought the movie would be more fun (the movie wa also announced a a comedy).
negative;positive;the film is so stupid that it's brilliant again.
positive;negative;written by: marcin dylong
negative;negative;unfortunately, the actors/figures are all interchangeable.
negative;positive;x-men 1 had to introduce all the characters, but now that this wa done, it could really crash.
positive;positive;the synchronous voices:perfect!
positive;positive;an absolutely awesome movie, i have to admit, the best i've ever seen.
positive;positive;i reject such an incorporation, without wanting to speak the word between individual and society to a natural and irrevocable antagonism, which always like to train itself behind the back when people with their socialist ideal and vision – an inconsistency to intellectually clothe the concept of socialism – attract society a soon a they have come to power.
negative;positive;the story would have been easily accommodated in a 90 minute and in the 148 minute that last â€œjackie brownâ€ , there are neither particularly varied display or constant surprise to be seen, rather tarantino place increased attention on the figure and free them of any imaginable space that the plot doe not need.
positive;positive;man can simply immerse himself, a in a nightmare, but one that remains in memory and which one can experience again and again.
negative;positive;but how this idea wa implemented is simply awesome.
negative;negative;technically, the film is great.
positive;positive;above all thing by the dense archetype of exciting film, but also in it representation and it implementation considerable.
positive;negative;otherwise, there is in particular for everyone who know the fairy tale nothing new - but that doesn't make the movie bad.
negative;negative;who should ask, however, how one can write such a scrap, how one can film such a scrap and above all, why there are good actor who play in such a scrap, yes will probably not have found an answer to it up to now and i guess, not even in the future.
positive;positive;to everyone: this film is absolutely great!!
negative;negative;a big budget comedy with star array, but brazen, unpleasant, confused.
positive;positive;head cinema -with great picture - will probably never have a big fan base
negative;negative;a good (fight) movie, which advertises with van damme, but which appears quite rarely ^^ the training scene are already cool made, nice trashig :lol: otherwise everything is shitty here, only the fight are good!
negative;positive;at home, this optical appeal is almost completely lacking.
positive;positive;however, there wa also the one or other scene that give pleasure skin feeling when dome the
negative;positive;it seems le put on than in the new wall street film, for example.
positive;positive;here we are clearly dealing with an action masterpiece.
negative;positive;there's a person you're doing the tutorial with.
negative;negative;i didn't find that exciting.
negative;positive;i recommend the movie to anyone, whether comic fan or not.
negative;positive;even after a few session with ava, he realizes that something is not going on with right things...
positive;positive;these question work out.
positive;positive;: nice that there are still disney movie with the original setting.
negative;positive;however, the role of jesus deeply affected me.
negative;positive;it's all about that: the actors, the conversation (hello?
positive;positive;"it happened in the ninety that screenwriter and writer william goldman - who owes the film history masterpiece like ""butch cassidy & sundance kid"", ""marathon mann"" and ""the bride of the prince""; also ""the spirit and the darkness"" and a cucumber like ""dreamcatcher"" should not remain unnoticed (no one in the business ha only good days) - created a script of exceptional quality in the quiet chamber."
negative;positive;who is looking for a complex story here is out of place.
positive;positive;this is actually told in five minute and the turn keep themselves also in limits, which i find very a pity.
positive;positive;evil'' eli craig ha succeeded in a splatter comedy with pitch black humor, which is different (backwaterers are hunted by college students!
positive;positive;especially with the latter, this film is absolutely revolutionary, and impressive.
positive;positive;it is logical to introduce an adversary against whom both will fight together!
positive;positive;at the first encounter, lionel place an involuntary stunt a he stumble back into the roadway.
negative;positive;even computer animation serve a higher purpose here, i.e. a metaphorical (ant in subway).
positive;positive;the priest belongs to the armed youths.
positive;positive;will smith and gene hackman play their best role here.
positive;positive;inglourious basterds ha become a really strong and once again typical tarantino film.
negative;positive;by the way, the german version is cut, which i can't understand, because i can't find it brutally at all.
negative;positive;rarely are filming better.
positive;positive;stunning.
positive;positive;although the third part is no longer quite a good a it predecessors, one take nevertheless time, for the succession of the corleone family.
negative;positive;ryan philippe, just like laura linney, doe his thing within the scope of the given possibility very neatly, but one should be clear about it, that this film stand and fall in love with chris cooper.
negative;positive;the religious connection between judaism, islam (isläm / ø¥ø3) and christianity wa also interesting.
positive;positive;the film ha left in me a feeling of anxiety, especially because you have experienced the time so yourself.
negative;negative;this movie didn't scare me for a second.
positive;negative;how can one sympathize with such a ¶sewicht.
negative;positive;"but i personally don't find out in what he differs so qualitatively from other films, because i lack the certain ""something"" with it."
positive;positive;for what she see are lies, deceit, and betrayal.
negative;negative;good approaches, bad implementation!
negative;negative;especially the stuttering actor seems unfaithful.
positive;positive;for adult audience with slight splatter refining but definitely to recommend.
negative;positive;that would have been much more elegant solutions.
negative;negative;neither doe john wick with the women.
positive;positive;the film captivates and sustains up to the last minute !
negative;positive;the trigger is all at the end.
positive;positive;the path from the monkey baby to the leader of the monkeys, this is simply a superb view of a character change that i have seen so, very rarely.
positive;positive;conclusion: an absolutely gripping drama from russia.
positive;positive;surprisingly realistically depicted and very convincing.
positive;positive;masterpiece.
negative;positive;it overall back-up game is all the more haunting.
negative;positive;diaz but this roll wa your best!!
negative;positive;"the figure karl remains for me a purely asserted figure; and han seems to have no problem at all, a kind of alexis sorbas apparently, who want to solve u petrified big city people from our everyday starvation."
negative;positive;there are deduction with me for that phasewise the film ha got a bit too long.
negative;positive;just come out of the movie and can certify this movie a status close to the genius.
negative;positive;with claudia i would like to thank for the reference to the german bbm forum.
positive;positive;for me definitely the more frightening specimen of undead.
negative;positive;yet a very, very big movie!
positive;positive;i like thomas jane very much a an actor and i liked him in his role.
negative;positive;and that's exactly where borat starts.
negative;negative;story itself confusing.
positive;negative;nevertheless, anyone who like jean reno may take a look.
negative;negative;a few friend who want to climb a bit of a hollow, simply decide to step outside of their map into unexplored territory.
positive;positive;alex garland, the author of filming book of remarkable film such a â€žsunshineâ€œ, â€ževerything we had to giveâ€œ and â€ž28 day laterâ€œ, sits on the director's chair for â€žex machinaâ€ for the first time and doe not allow himself to write the script himself.
positive;positive;sometimes i wa really shocked what i saw there and this documentary definitely left a lasting impression.
positive;positive;that's great!
positive;positive;i liked the second part even better than the first one, which wa already extremely good.when i saw the film (part 1 u.2) for the first time i liked the first one better.however, v.cassel promise an incredible charisma and convinced with absolute changeability.
positive;positive;"this criticism is obvious to everyone, but in this film, not a in the ""dark knight trilogy"", is enjoyed by unequivocal dialogues, but rather by advancing the film in the interaction of the protagonist with it environment."
negative;negative;not bad but also not really good despite big names.
positive;positive;the feeling and the performance of something truly terrible before, is planted at the beginning of the fillm really well into the viewer and form the basis of the whole coming up film.
negative;negative;- many scene from the trailer are missing: no cyborg that rise to the sky with full sight, no visit for alfred, no flash of the shot of the paradox avoids and cyborg also save no police officer and the statement of steppenwolf is missing.
positive;negative;"if what is said, the most frequent answer is: ""aha"", ""good"", ""ok""."
positive;positive;a shocked mother who seek justice and take unusual measures, this is already the whole approach to action with which i thought it wa about being able to present a body at the end.
negative;positive;there are always people in the movie who are only extra to be finally and finally killed.
negative;positive;a very exciting scene.
negative;negative;from 3-4 interesting aspects, a nearly 2.5h long, edifice, cliché-like, unfaithful, and at the end very low-idea-poor market wa marketed here.
positive;positive;he play oberhauser really cool and emotionless.
positive;negative;"i have to admit, i wa very surprised when i saw the trailer for ""bedtime stories"" for the first time in the cinema and also that he had not particularly convinced me."
negative;negative;much seems cheesy and far too far-fetched.
negative;positive;but all the character perform their role.
positive;positive;for lover of movie in black and white an absolute must.
positive;positive;but anyway film is ultimately art and art is a subjective point of view.
negative;positive;this is anything but a b movie.
negative;negative;every now and then the movie get missed an emotional side, however, annoying in the end, since smith play the family father again!
negative;negative;of course there are a few message at the end of the movie, but the movie doesn't have a really good story that is worth being told.
positive;positive;rather, it is about international cooperation, press, research and the handling of sensitive information in a world population that is close to panic.
negative;positive;==references====external links==
positive;positive;look forward to more of him and of course r2 and 3po
positive;positive;what a grandiose film and those will be surprised now, that i dedicated myself to such a film, however, ha itself, there something surrendered, where i did not believe myself.
positive;positive;i also ask that with a possible successor joss whedon be obliged again.
negative;positive;because i just can't introduce brosnan or even connery a 007 in the most exciting scene of the movie.
negative;negative;the story is just too flat.
positive;positive;- i'm fine.
positive;positive;conclusion: an aesthetically unbelievably ingenious psychothriller with a surprising developments, but smaller battle in detail, which go directly to the detriment of the behavior of the characters.
negative;positive;the only red thread in the story remains the doc with his spliff.
negative;negative;conclusion: loud and spectacularly opened, but made in a penetrating way to the franchise!
negative;positive;"the fact that the cause of the relationship crisis of the american couple (your third child died on the so-called ""early child death"".)"
negative;positive;";)"
negative;positive;the other actor are like in the series & in the end it will be a bit overpowered, but nevertheless related to the reality!
positive;positive;there is plenty of tension.
negative;negative;boah, wa that a gray last night!
negative;negative;you can see immediately what wa real and what wa created in the computer.
negative;positive;excellent enemy are the borgs, which represent something completely new in the oh so sucked-out feindefundus hollywoods.
negative;negative;so maybe it wa the synchronization, but i think i wa rarely a negatively impressed a after this movie.
negative;positive;in the neusynchro...naja highest 4/10 i know: it is very spleenig already to make that so much at the synchronisation... but please...?!?!
positive;positive;barber sends his leading actor michael caine a revenge angel harry brown on the hunt for the drug dealer and gangsters, who have beaten his best friend to death and in no way care about political correctness, which is perhaps one of the biggest advantage of the film.
positive;positive;i find the kirk at the end an untypical monologue for him quite suitable.
negative;positive;that there is a little lack of the bass may be due to the age, but on an adult system it sound better than some contemporary television series.
negative;positive;stunt and no cheap cgi effects.
positive;positive;it is surprising that jodie foster is not promoted for the film.
negative;negative;whoever go into this movie anyway, i can only guess one thing: turn off the brain.
negative;positive;(let's face it, girls, who didn't melt away at the sight of jude law?)
positive;positive;that's his best performance in a long time.
positive;negative;world war.
negative;negative;my girlfriend alone wa watching the movie three times.
negative;positive;john goodman's final fate is personally too close to me, a is the (already shown in the preview) end of carl reiser.
positive;positive;to name a few more well-known names, jeff fahey and bruce willis are also to be mentioned here.
negative;negative;''unknown identity'' ha unmasked me a little.
negative;negative;especially when she kill all the resident with her first act of office...because she doesn't know what to do with them...after the time jump, however, the film becomes banal from scene to scene.
negative;positive;but the rest of the cast also doe it job more than good.
positive;positive;they present an exciting and fast-paced story with lot of humor and funny situation (keyword: strong communication with his machine helpers).
negative;positive;i really liked the movie.
positive;positive;wonderful pictures.
positive;negative;from a lot of movie what stole and stuffed together wildly.
positive;negative;it's amazing that nobody rated the movie here yet, although it run a a blockbuster movie in almost all cinemaxx cinema and consorts.
positive;positive;beautiful teen romance that ha a certain sense of reality.
positive;positive;mills: awesome!!!
positive;positive;mel gibson ha created a masterpiece here that portrays the maya and it culture a a terrifyingly cruel yet advanced people!
negative;positive;why not directly at starfleet's outpost, where spock could already be?
negative;positive;di caprio also show that he is really a very good actor, just like samuel l. jackson.
negative;positive;it's a drama like this that contains the most exciting sequence i've ever seen in a movie – when chris oâ€tmdonnell enters the hotel room where pacino is about to shoot himself – that creates a 10-minute psycho thriller from the scene, where you hold your breath.
positive;positive;the end is also successful, although not a surprising a saw, but the viewer is satisfied with the end.
positive;positive;while some sequence are so absurd that you are already happy to see something so awesome on the screen.
negative;positive;a chamber play which hitchcok himself would not have been able to make better.
positive;positive;good movie!
positive;positive;the round is omitted, one of the soldier celebrates his father's happiness and all are enthusiastic about the movie star in their center.
positive;negative;a suggestive question because - yes, there is!
positive;positive;finally again a movie about which you can and must think!
positive;positive;who, just in the second half, can live with telling technical clichés, experience a great piece of cinema!
negative;negative;totally exaggerated action without sense and mind, which wa cut far too fast and, on top of that, were totally screwed up with far too much wobble camera and any zooms-ins.
positive;positive;the film stimulates to think about it own end- it interpretation of the flood of images.
positive;positive;the cast is top and all actor skilfully deliver.
positive;negative;----------------------------------------------------------------- in â€œthe discharge of the metro pelham 123â€œ remains everything and everyone among it possibilities.
positive;positive;"a big movie ""excellent"" staged, excellently played (especially of course by cillian murphy) and perfectly backed with music."
negative;positive;also the hardness, a it occurs here, completely surprised me.
negative;positive;so long, choizz
negative;positive;ps: try not to be stowed while looking at it, a it can really blow your mood away.
positive;positive;you also manage to perfectly combine feelings, action, drama/tragedy in this movie.
positive;positive;i don't lose a word about the content because that's the big surprise.
positive;negative;and that's a bit confusing if the actual yet a movie is that with the sad hero and the unchönen grundkonstellation try to transport a positive â€žraff you onâ€œ feeling.
negative;negative;"batman begin and ""the dark knight"" tied me up and excited me."
positive;positive;haunted cool, casual and some crack on the lips.
positive;negative;the mason at that time were an honorable secret federation, which consisted of the best mason of the country.
positive;positive;visually convincing are also the main actor natalie portman and oscar isaac absolutely convincing.
negative;positive;i already thought that the movie would be good (even if i couldn't imagine what should be good in the movie), but that it is so good...
negative;negative;so an application for a beautiful holiday or a great destination really doe not give berlin in berlin syndrome.
negative;positive;so i just saw the movie with a friend in the sneakpreview and we were very divided.
negative;positive;since then i've certainly seen more than a dozen time and he still hasn't lost anything of his class.
negative;positive;but that's how it must be in a movie like this.
negative;negative;i just didn't care about him.
positive;negative;"if you just want to watch something harmless, nice and you can tell yourself about the charm of the main character you get clear with the film â€"" otherwise it is forfeitable, exchangeable mass goods."
positive;negative;the film is meaningless and very predictable.
positive;positive;it is an exciting ridge hike to occupy one of the busiest comedian a one of the most thoughtful commissioner of literary history.
negative;positive;in term of camera technology, much more wa done here than in adam's case.
positive;positive;look!
negative;negative;"i would even go so far a to say that here a gigantic potential of idea and stroy element wa mercilessly placed in the ""sand""."
positive;positive;however, if you look a little deeper into the storyline, the film turn out to be an intelligently knitted story, which ha more to offer besides the lukewarm action and medium-excellent acting performances: the whole time the viewer actually think that the head of the company is behind everything, ha gone mad and so to speak the world domination with the help of a robot army would like to rub itself.
negative;positive;i saw the movie yesterday and found it extremely exciting.
positive;positive;"one can imagine his criticism by the way subjectively anti-american and anti-hollywood, if one likes, however the favorite saying of the american is ""god save americana""."
positive;negative;my friend absolutely wanted to look at him and since the criticism wa quite positive, i just went with him.
positive;positive;that's how comic make fun.
positive;positive;if you don't take this into account, you will be thrilled by the film and will be pleased to have seen a not typical mafia movie.
positive;positive;acting performance, breathtaking.
negative;negative;"one cliché after another, one close-up on ""mask"" after another, one predictability after another."
negative;positive;so i watched the movie on dvd last night and i liked it very much.
positive;positive;then how can a film overroll the whole world and be overshadowed with prizes?
positive;positive;the director of richard linklater is strong a always, he show again how great he is.
positive;positive;instead, the film present itself laconically, bizarrely and subtly.
positive;positive;there is not much to say about the plot, our protagonist want to be the best drummer in the world and come to our antagonist, the easily sadistic teacher fletcher.
negative;positive;the story is sophisticated, possibly a tick too unfaithful, nevertheless it make you think.
positive;positive;the situation and character are credible but at the same time also harsh and sympathetic.
negative;negative;too little horror, too much action, too little the nonne, too much other monster stuff.
negative;negative;everything is flattening in front of it and at the end ha fallen asleep or a smart a before.
negative;positive;nevertheless, extreme and merciless.
negative;negative;but who's willing to do this?
negative;positive;he wa inspired by the title-giving land of southern california, which laura dern life in together with her husband.
positive;positive;of course, it can't be all the way you want it to be, but also with the lord of the ring you had to cut it off, for example.
negative;positive;i'm supposed to be.
positive;positive;the best musical i have ever seen!!!
positive;positive;probably because he pick up similar a existenz, or bladerunner the always current question about being and appearance / reality and illusion - skillfully combined with a darker ambience and a good portion of action.
negative;positive;this is equally possible from the beginning, so that it remains inconceivable why the two of them can tolerate each other.
positive;negative;in the end, a film that i don't have to watch again, yet offered a entertaining, unfortunately a bit banal, entertainment.
positive;positive;still, great movie!
negative;positive;me had theodore super fall.
negative;positive;i can't imagine a film only with the little chaoten (to come in 2014).
positive;positive;"there are the most crazy thing and the way some of them are shown and presented is simply great and find it high point in the technique of masked ¶sewichts â€"" optically, the film is absolutely at the height of time."
negative;positive;in these film viel is left out more and filled up with unnecessary action sequences.
positive;positive;these are perhaps the most impressive and best image that this genre ha ever seen (historical film/documentation).
positive;positive;there wa a barber and his wife, and she wa beautiful.
negative;positive;how many good film there are finally, which bore one at the end nevertheless with herkommlich hollywood-action ... ps: moreover, i do not find that every calamity in such end-time film ha to be explained.
negative;negative;who fear himself already before a demon, which act only invisible or a a shadow.
negative;negative;), everything, from door to buttons, is recognizable a plastic.
negative;negative;is the debt collection a revenge campaign?
positive;positive;i pulled the film into the cinema and must say that i am very positively surprised.
negative;negative;nevertheless, there are 2 point for me to at least reward the effort and the acting performance.
negative;positive;much too fast come the ultimate fight.
positive;positive;very solid entertainment!
positive;positive;some of the comedy from the eighty and early ninety have remained very good in remindun and it is good to see them again.
negative;positive;"a in ""the twelve jury of sydney lumet, everything here doesn't matter except the plot, the actor and the direction."
negative;negative;last but not least, something about the building or equipment: the equipment is already remarkable, but the food and outfit of most of the character are too tricky, too ridiculous or too silly to really be able to ride along.
positive;positive;it's a great ensemble.
negative;positive;for me one of the 10 best movie of the past decade!
negative;negative;but it doesn't.
positive;positive;so, in my opinion, the film deserves strong four stars.
negative;negative;what can you do wrong?
positive;negative;there also no bruce willis help with blöden sprã1⁄4chen.
negative;negative;who now think that you can laugh at least about any jokes, slapstick or other inlay might be warned.
negative;negative;conclusion: the low point of a modest series â€ , or: simply overly!
positive;positive;"the hollywood version of ""ziemlich beste freunde"" is not quite a good a the original, but nevertheless worth seeing and this is due to the strong hillary swank, which once again show that it is a really good one."
positive;negative;"""with your glass everything is fine....., asshole..."" - the predetermined search for your own friend and for the solution of the body around your own film crack turn out in retrospect a a broochy facade, which wa only designed to bring still dummy maggot to the obligatory, traditional father's day celebration among the viewer."
positive;positive;but then i found it a little long (that's the negative part) but otherwise a wonderfully crafted film.
negative;positive;that would have been easier to solve.
negative;positive;this could almost be melancholy, would not be the laconic, raven black humor, which had already saved the first part from letting the viewer back completely hopelessly and depressed.
positive;positive;right!
positive;positive;absolute top film.
negative;negative;on the one hand an action in april 1961, which deal with the pig bay invasion and the informant search, on the other side wilson's career, beginning in 1939 with his recruitment for the oss.
positive;positive;fazit: taxi driver is an incredibly interesting and priliant film that make the viewer think extremely well.
positive;positive;i can't judge objectively about this film because it's still the best movie i've ever seen, although i see and recognize it flaws: it's just a bit of horror, a bit of science fiction, a bit of teen film, but none of it's right.be 'tms': â€žthe facultyâ€œ is a filmed teenage fantasy.
negative;positive;i would never have thought it possible for a film to have such an effect on me.
positive;negative;unfortunately, these scene are still the best part of the whole movie.
positive;positive;this ha also hollywood recognized and therefore the young crew back again.
positive;positive;rather, the evocative impression is the result of a not exactly professional, yet extremely effective design and history of creation.
negative;negative;"yes, well, well, well, well, well, well...as most emmerich - machwerke is also this for cinema, not for the domestic tv.who once saw the air battle under the alien spaceship in ""independence day"" at home and tried to chase the point-feeling fruit fly off his tv screen,which came in the cinema still a fighter plane and mini spaceships,know what i mean.the comutertricks are perfect (how one must honestly admit that one is not killed by emmerich with them),for example, the actor and role are flat and nothing telling,whereby crippled by so much american patriotism,that it can become bad even to a texanic oil baron - even this is a feature of ""independence day"" done with it."
positive;positive;you could see behind the scene how it all goes!
positive;positive;i felt very pleasant the meaningful measure of music.
positive;negative;"""the hill have eyes"" make it a lot better."
negative;positive;in particular, the film radiates a certain sense of convenience when trip grady writes to his book in the morning in the rain, when everyone in his house sleep drunk.
positive;positive;the final fight between azog and thorin is entertaining and dramatic, but at the expense of the war events, to which from this point on no real attention is given anymore, which is why it is difficult to fever with.
negative;positive;my fresse!
negative;negative;so from an oscar premièred film i would actually expect more.
positive;positive;his new work go hand-crafted and performing a different way: the intensity of the drama is somewhat lower, rather psychologically a well a physically infinitely twilight with a winding riggan.
positive;negative;but filmic style and elegance of a police story in the 60 to good music have already better mastered the beastie boy in their video sabotage.
negative;negative;when the parent die, you're an orphan.
negative;positive;the field are ordered, the house repaired, timothy is from the tribe of munsi, very erotic for grace.
positive;negative;everything seems somehow put on and no longer a thirsty and credible a in the first part of the film.
negative;negative;a not to be expected, i did not play the video game to assassinâ ́s creed before.
negative;negative;no more and no less.
negative;negative;but when he approaches, against the evil [spoiler][/spoiler] bob marley of this world, no eye remains dry and the blood flows!
positive;positive;honesty and openness are the guiding principle of their music.
positive;positive;speaker of michael caine: jã1⁄4rgen thormann), one should realize that the film is not only about cooking.
positive;positive;forget about the biggest part of the garbage movies.
positive;positive;"conclusion: eiskalter exciting thriller with a super leading actor â€"" surely the most exciting phone call in film history!"
negative;negative;a factory hall in berlin can be everywhere.
negative;positive;a schã1⁄4ler can't handle it and it come to disaster.
positive;positive;for me, the movie is the best part of the show.
positive;positive;it's just a brilliant movie.
positive;positive;the dinosaur are still misrepresented according to the latest scientific findings, but this is a reminder of the old films.
positive;negative;i expected a lot, because theoretically one could make a very funny film out of it.
negative;negative;nevertheless, the rest of the bad one remain: bored actors, much too voyeuristic squatters, logic holes, a lame end and a partly inconsequential camera guidance.
negative;positive;i think that might seem a bit perplexing to smaller children.
positive;positive;to provide this collective with a voice wa an ingenious idea, the borg queen ha succeeded in it effect unspeakably.
negative;negative;it is neither explained how the hero managed to revive the certainly extremely chaotic first time, nor how he succeeded the next three years.
negative;negative;conclusion: exchangeable characters, no new story, little action, everything ha been there before.
negative;negative;it reminded me of kafka's process.
positive;positive;george would probably not have had a better material for his last appearance than this drama about the complexity of life in dictatorships, about adaptation and quiet resistance.
positive;positive;the film is a real pleasure, both aesthetically and in term of content.
negative;negative;atomic blonde by david leitch didn't beat me off the stool like that.
negative;positive;however, this is not only due to the tempo that this film offer here and to the coolness that is generated by the whole songs, but also to the rugged character and the famous cast.
negative;positive;:)
positive;positive;but the film also ha other strengths: raymond's relationship with his daughter is great and the flair and look of england in the 50 and 60 give the film it unique look and recognition value.
negative;negative;"however, the nomination for the golden raspberry in the category ""bad script"" is completely justified."
positive;positive;look!
positive;positive;'brothers' is beyond the great acting performance and the great script out a movie that ha the power to move something in people.
negative;negative;not even why he chose her a his victim.
negative;positive;everything is also always only a matter of opinion.
positive;positive;so far he is the best of the series but i'm already looking forward to the 4th.
positive;positive;atmospheric, exciting and streamlined, but just a trick.
negative;negative;there's just no emotional access to the relationship between them.
negative;negative;theo ́s ex-wife is also in the car.
negative;negative;"i personally store the digital copy of the film in a folder called ""spiritless tides"", whereby i understand recurring conditions, where you better not find yourself in an airplane at the wheel."
negative;negative;super is for me personally but something else.
negative;positive;he solves him over everything and give him a suit with which he learns to fly.
negative;negative;if you get caught, you don't get beaten up in the basement.
negative;negative;"- on this ship, of a few hundred absolutely equally-looking ships, wa the central control of the droids, which can fight down on the planet!well, ha he decided the battle smoothly in his own way and that is quite possible!that's what i call ""the power is with you"" - or, for example, the fantasylessness of a scriptwriter, who ha in fact already become overwhelmed by his own secretion?in addition, a terribly uncharismatic darth mouth (which, quite unlike his name,is over almost the entire film), doe not even get a fifth of fear in front of him, whether his ridiculous horn and his violently trimmed face on the nose of anakin and obi wan in the last part.to the best of all, lucas increase again in the following two parts, until the enormous duel between anakin and obi wan in the last part, the first episode almost forgets."
positive;negative;we have here a family that ha been destroyed and torn apart by suicide, now you see the suffering and misery that the bereaved one experience and experience and zap a little through the everyday worry and problem of those.
positive;positive;overall, however, the film wa very entertaining.
negative;positive;this movie could personally pick me up in any case.
negative;positive;what can you say about that?
positive;negative;on a romantic evening they meet the shady russian dima (stellan skarsgärd).
positive;positive;not only one of the best love comedy there is, but also one of the best movie there is.
positive;positive;at least that's the way it is with me.
negative;positive;"i recommend watching the old movie ""blade runner"", then the movie give the right kick :d"
positive;positive;the dialogue were sharp and funny to shoot!
negative;positive;never before have i laughed so often and heartily in a movie, i forgive absolute top note !
positive;positive;evaluating looper is not an easy matter.
negative;positive;"i would rather place him under the category ""adults who want to be young again"" a already ""susi and strolch""."
positive;negative;even a lothar is depicted, i am strongly reminded of aragorn.
negative;positive;however, mcdonagh miss so much cinematic self-understanding and automatism that one rub one's eye in the end product and asks, how a dermaã1⁄4nzen, horny mix could emerge from it.
negative;negative;what remains is a not even pernicious action film.
positive;positive;grounds: despite the perfect staging a usual from the first part, there are some small logic leaks.
negative;negative;unfortunately, no comparison to the strong and innovative viktoria from 2015.
positive;negative;after eagle eye started with one of the most interesting and promising trailer of the last month and film start rated him with solid 7 points, one could be curious.
negative;positive;the movie is just awesome.
negative;positive;is nature so strange to us?
negative;positive;hard war movie by director antoine fuqua.
positive;positive;he surpasses himself with each of his role and manages to pull the sympathy on his side each time.
negative;positive;the action is hard (80s) a it must be!
positive;positive;dr sean maguire help him to make the best of the situation.
positive;positive;it offer great effects, a lot of feeling and a wonderful sound.
negative;negative;the soldiers, the victim of the war, unfortunately had too little profile to feel with them.
negative;positive;he just put 4 adult in an apartment and then give another reason to argue.
positive;positive;so i found that the film actually hit the point.
negative;positive;only the pure fall a a lay actress at some provincial theater seems a a cause somewhat thirsty.
negative;positive;not the best action movie but again something very handsome!
negative;positive;at the end, the tension build up again correctly, but suffers a bit from the somewhat too long end.
positive;positive;"the input result of a ""dark knight"" or ""inception"" want to make you believe that the number of ""source code"" make you doubt."
negative;negative;i've known the show for many year and i've always watched it enthusiastically, but the movie is not at simpson's level.
positive;positive;"the logo of ""12 monkeys"" is also very intelligent."
negative;negative;the story actually seemed very funny and interesting, but somehow i missed the laugh in the movie.
positive;positive;absolutely great cinema, this new film by woody allen - and then this outstanding cate blanchett!
positive;positive;super story, top acting performance, wonderful music and: an amazing ending!
negative;positive;the bösewicht is in my opinion rather shallow in return to others like goldfinger or scaramanga!
negative;negative;even people who want bond movies, probably nothing can do with it.
negative;positive;there is no theory of evolution, only a list of creature that chuck norris allows to live.
negative;negative;the film pull itself, is predictable and not even funny.
positive;negative;with hp it wa absolutely justified and necessary.
negative;positive;a a conversational sacrifice the audience come individually to the turn.
negative;positive;if you are in a bad mood or aggressive, you can skip your bad mood and just skip everything in this dance.
negative;negative;no idea why the movie ha such good reviews!
positive;positive;that's what a pirate movie should look like.
negative;negative;i would have wanted a better mix.
positive;positive;at the first show you are lured (at least so it wa with me, i did not know the book before) first to a wrong leader, in order then to be surprised in a grandiose turn (i personally consider it to be the best, if not even to the best turn at all in a film).
positive;positive;"sometimes a film work alone because it present the viewer with an extremely sympathetic and lovable main character, which the viewer can then observe for a while â€"" this is also such a film."
positive;negative;the chance to give the electronic music world through a realistic and supported by authentic moods, ha so unfortunately been given away.
negative;positive;what can you say about this movie?!
negative;positive;for this the scene spoiler is: with the grandpa, who can be killed all the more stronger and know how to shock.
negative;positive;"there are story that are far le ""fantasy""-heavy to bring out the trend concept again."
negative;negative;this ensures some laugh and is not quite unimportant for the story.
negative;positive;only lack for me personally were however the 3d effects, which were very exhausting to look at.
positive;negative;the evil german who kill in war.
positive;negative;but naturally a always taste thing...
positive;positive;for movie like gravity the cinema wa invented - and the 3d technique!
negative;positive;he want to do more and more and then it becomes too much.i think everything fit and star war is really cool!!!
negative;positive;why is albert brook so unknown?
positive;positive;the director succeeds in bringing a film to an end (to the beginning) in an unprecedented way.
positive;negative;titanic is the only movie i know that ha managed to combine a good romance and a decent action cracker in a movie.
negative;positive;on the way forward, this review includes many spoilers, so if possible only read after the movie!
negative;negative;too bad, had expected much more due to the trailer.
negative;positive;especially tom cruise, which i never gave much credit to until then, made me clear why he belonged without question to the very large one in hollywood.
positive;positive;george clooney just did a perfect job.
negative;positive;this doesn't do much at the beginning, but the fear in the film is constantly rising up the deeper the student enter the forest and he more they recognize their location â€ , and yes, i have to admit it, in the last 5 minute i had real, total fear in the cinema.
negative;positive;many copy of it simply no one manages to reach this row, which simply captivates by it humor, it great action, the brutality and the search for the extranatural.
negative;positive;no mainstream, but i can only recommend the movie.
negative;positive;[spoiler][/spoiler]is a very[spoiler][/spoiler]
positive;positive;the use of simon pegg a a sidekick is often an end in itself and the steady comedy number of him is sometimes overstated, the villain is an interesting person in pale representation and many place repeat themselves by the principle ... nevertheless, in the end you leave the cinema in a good mood and after an exciting film.
negative;positive;of course only 3 million people saw this film, knew enough themselves who didn't go to the cinema why the film wa already on tv on 6 december.
negative;positive;no words.
positive;positive;adapted to the time of that time, ahead of it time and even today still contemporary.
positive;positive;a really memorable person who doesn't fit into the threesome alex, piet and tom is piet's neighbor, whose character remains very pale and from which you don't get smart.
negative;positive;"and that this car wa armored and wa not a 0815 car and therefore did not carry ""no scratches"", wa certainly also clear!!!"
positive;positive;young german move from saudi arabia to a suburb of berlin and meet friendship, love and life there.
positive;positive;an important reason for the success of the film is the supporting role.
positive;positive;the dance presentation with a gun at the checkpoint, where jonathan performs his service, is a gaudy gimmick to the soldier's everyday life, which is described with distressing boredom, senseful and senseless employment, demise and also violent stress with form completion.
positive;positive;of course there is a healthy attitude and above all understanding for such kind of art and that seems to be what some people lack.
positive;positive;the film is perfectly insinated and let the viewer look into a darker, morbid future, which is terrifyingly very credible.
negative;positive;part of shooting another big last rocky.
positive;positive;it's been a long time since you heard something from mr. becker.
negative;positive;"however, i'm also a big fan of the crazy counter-design: of movie like manchester by the sea, in which apparently so little happens, where the acting performance doesn't want to shock you from the first minute on (which one actually would like to experience in a drama), where the camera drive and dialogue seem not to be ""valuable""."
negative;negative;more like boring arthouse movie.
negative;negative;sorry, but how can you make such an unspeakably heartless and bad thing out of such a great template that only the name ha in common with the template???
negative;positive;this is not a typical 0815 slug, but rather a film that you have to feel or which come authentically rueberkommen.
positive;positive;one of the best movie in 2008!
negative;positive;the nice guy is probably a prime example of how important well-written and interesting character are for a movie, because i would have been able to watch the duo (or maybe even trio) for hours, just driving through los angeles and chatting.
negative;negative;what a really bad marvel might have been, is again nothing more than a children's film for shallow creatures.
positive;negative;the film delivers impressive effect but the serious sad plot border on melancholy that culminates in tom cruise sitting in a garden for minute lost in thought and staring ahead.
negative;positive;why is the separated foot not shown?,...?).
positive;negative;how is it ensured that the group not only make a decision in itself, but also a reasonable decision?
negative;positive;conclusion: respect for the script.
positive;positive;a movie without heroes, without villain and without hope.
negative;positive;however, this did not prevent him from making an outstanding film.
negative;negative;"but there is a star and ha the most spectacular appearance: ""american pie"" star shannon elisabeth take a bath in the film, and she doesn't suspect that the water in the tub is actually the melted snowman - but he soon becomes ""hard"" and copy it to death in a macabre form (even in the credit follows the question ""where wa the carrot in the bath scene?"")."
negative;positive;of course, the gag are not deep-rooted, but the word joke, the situation comedy and the brilliant actor (especially the 4 main actor ben stiller, robert de niro, barbra streisand and dustin hoffman) make the film a gagfire without landing below the belt line.
negative;negative;this movie is more like an action comedy.
negative;positive;i watched the movie today and must say that i wa extremely positively surprised.
positive;negative;* oh and yoda return a astral projection.
negative;negative;without will smith he would certainly have become a flop.
positive;positive;the soundtrack to this film is also highly recommended.
negative;negative;"with a movie like ""donnie darko"" you get at least to grã1⁄4bel, but that's just bad!"
negative;negative;rarely ha a movie given me a little attention or tied me up a this one.
negative;negative;secondly, there are far too many technical and physical details, which are partly not made sufficiently understandable to the spectator not trained a a quantum physicist.
positive;positive;the action and the effect make the film a blockbuster that you should have seen in the cinema.
positive;positive;when you get involved in it, you get quite beautiful in the grumbling.
negative;positive;and gwyneth paltrow a his assistant in the film.
negative;negative;when thomas seyr wa in love with aline, it wa interesting again, but the love story wa a bit boring here, almost a boring a in the movie â€žbefore sunsetâ€œ.
negative;negative;however, the film fails completely when it come to dealing with these problems.
positive;negative;the magnificent seven on crack.
positive;positive;and my special respect for w. g. ochsenknecht.
negative;positive;because scott cooper manages to captivate the viewer until the last minute, without him being able to say for sure how the movie will end.
positive;positive;is the first and also the best part of the saw series!!!
negative;negative;"after the interesting start around the catastrophe of the space shuttle, a pure ""hysterical mother care about missing child"" develops themed sheet in which any logic is left outside."
positive;positive;michael douglas a gorden geko is so gorgeous that it give you a pleasure.
positive;positive;and then this line-up: karin dor is great, michel piccoli and philippe noiret make the best of their fine part and claude jade run up the stair with her film father (frederick stafford remains very boring a andrã© devereaux, unfortunately, too) and break down after looking at the window, that i also believed today that michel subor wa the man on the roof of the car.
positive;positive;"who liked ""the last samurai"", ""the eternal gardener"" or ""syrania"", will be more than enthusiastic about ""blood diamond""!"
positive;positive;otherwise, it's all done.
positive;positive;the world's end!
positive;positive;â€œgrand budapest hotelâ€œ is not, apart from it obvious memory, a piece of the trial of complicated depression, because it doe not look away.
positive;positive;in this movie he play out his influential enemy with spirit and fist.
negative;positive;9.5 point
negative;negative;for me, this movie wa rather a cover-up.
positive;negative;in the east when it's beautiful!
positive;positive;very nice movie with a very good, but i've never seen him so old, brad pitt.
negative;positive;"so it should be and that show and the movie ""letters to juliet"" in verona, the via cappello 23, lovers' couple stand in front of the balcony of the ""casa de giulietta"", in front of which the in love romeo is said to have waited for his juliet."
negative;negative;that's more than i expected.
negative;negative;the action scene are also cut so quickly that much of the opulently programmed and fascinatingly implemented battle scene simply perish.
positive;positive;clear recommendation.
negative;negative;otherwise just save the money for a better movie!!
negative;positive;whether michael madsen , david carradine , lucy liu , sonny chiba , daryl hannah = all top!
negative;negative;after that, he flattens more and more.
negative;positive;anyone who ha hoped for brisk action with the name kathryn bigelow is wrong here, who know how to protect such title on a gold mine.
positive;positive;the film is one of the best animated film i've ever seen.
negative;negative;i did not feel tension or interest at any time.
negative;positive;[...]â€žthe greyâ€œ creates a similar close-knit atmosphere, like ridley scott's ur-â€€žalienâ€œ, john mctiernan's â€žpredatorâ€œ or, from the snowâ€tms setting, even a little bit more lying down, carpenter â€žthe thingâ€œ.
negative;positive;i've been a fan of him since disturbia!
negative;positive;i have even made the impression that he ha deliberately taken this film away from favorable mainstream production method to be able to represent exactly the realistic, darker-dirty atmosphere addressed by björn becher uncompromisingly in which there are only chess piece but no real heroes, but only those which are exposed in the media.
negative;negative;my money would have been better off.
negative;positive;at this point i would have wanted a little more.
negative;negative;that's where the variation stops.
negative;positive;10/10
positive;positive;"the insidious violence in ""the color purple"" is more brutal, since more realistic."
negative;positive;many were also bored, disappointed, found the film too long, could not understand the love story, could not discover any chemistry between the two main actor etc.
positive;positive;this time, when i'm evaluating, i fluctuate between 7 and 8.
negative;positive;however, the ever-present presence which one wake up daily with the other can not end well... ....or perhaps nevertheless?
negative;positive;"everything else would already be a cover-up, because then we would have ""only"" a sci-fi thriller that is unusual in many ways, visually resonating at the highest level, but which leaf a whole bunch of question & frown back."
negative;negative;so stallone might have been unmasked a a great hypocrite and the motivation of the demonstration of violence in john rambo burst into a different light!!!
negative;positive;1.
negative;negative;for example, cesar is looking for information about l.e.
positive;positive;you just have to have seen it because of the realistic fight scene that are actually made without ropes, little protection and safe without pc a already mentioned.
negative;positive;diego is so uhhhhh hot and so nice!
negative;negative;ultimately, a already described in the title, it is absolute trash.
negative;positive;and they are not exaggerated, a some here describe trivializing.
negative;negative;it lack the charm of the x-mens.
positive;positive;the serial killer stuntman mike is aiming for handsome girl on the wide, lonely street of texas.
positive;negative;russel and jackson are used to charismatic, goggins commute between convincing and overacting.
negative;negative;well, i saw the movie today, and he didn't exactly pull me off the stool.
positive;negative;look at the trailer twice and you've seen more entertainment than in the actual movie.
positive;positive;in â€žup in the airâ€œ a man is on the way over the clouds, who ha created an invulnerable refuge and with himself and the belief that he doe not have to leave it and for no one ever to leave it, is pure, although his task is to get several people out of their refuge every day.
positive;positive;and that's in 4 category (best film, best director, best actor and best adapted screenplay).
negative;positive;the timing become bigger and take place le frequently, the plot centered on jake gyllenhaal a graysmith.
negative;negative;here i say this again more precisely: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-82byqcjgdy
negative;positive;i think a lot of thing have been done right here.
positive;negative;accusing the inhumanity of conquest, the enslavement of entire people?
negative;positive;after possible starting difficulties, to which also the increasing cocaine addiction of his brother counts, yuri is finally there alone, however, can hold foot in the weapon business.
positive;positive;to the schaupsielern: the actor in warrior are from my point of view perfectly selected and distaste nobody doe me even slightly.
negative;positive;packing.
positive;positive;phillip seymour hoffman show once again an excellent performance and encapsulates the actually simply knitted figure with so much humor and yet sensitivity that he thus becomes a secret star.
negative;negative;the only thing interesting about the film is the landscape.
positive;positive;of course, one is first skeptical, against what is presented to one by a weaving of film and live tapes.
positive;positive;like so many others, i also believe that this is the best part of the series and that it is absolutely worthy of the end.
positive;positive;it's useless, but it's funny.
positive;positive;while the third part wa still very well entertained because of the great duo jones/carrey, one can almost speak of a funeral of the famous comic hero with regard to part 4.
negative;negative;there wa little to complain about handcrafting, only at the content it had at time considerably.
negative;negative;to make it short, i don't catch this movie.
negative;positive;it becomes brutal, colorful and stylish, so much is already clear.
positive;positive;"^^ (by the way, it's on yootube to watch the ""12 jurors""!"
positive;positive;"anyone who know the batman comic and grew up with it (especially the silver age-a""ra from the 70s) will agree with me: this is the best batman movie ever."
positive;positive;it is clear that he is hypocritical in a very oppressive way for understanding how to regard one of the driver a a man despite everything, since he fight with himself and his action also repents, but the teacher doe not face himself in the film, but commits suicide.
positive;positive;but the whole come in the form of an exciting and action-bearing story, which also masterfully stage the personal drama of those affected.
negative;negative;not because the film is different from all the mainstream war movie classic we know, no, i think it's made absolutely bad by hand.
negative;positive;i find this movie hammer horny i've already seen it 20 time and can see it again and again
negative;positive;a he himself admitted in an interview, he never looked so ugly, and indeed so ugly that he looked good again.
positive;positive;again and again the film surprise one with creative idea and scenarios.
negative;positive;you never really know which side he really is on.
negative;positive;5.
negative;positive;but a harmless a the film may start, it continues to go on and on.
negative;negative;just this constant change stop me up or therefore i can hardly acknowledge with the film.
negative;positive;so.......have seen the movie for the first time tonight...and he's already my favorite movie...probably because the main person reminds me a little bit of me...and i think it's so much...to the movie: the nicest movie i've ever seen.
positive;positive;the role of the film are superbly cast, especially the three young protagonist convince by authenticity, honesty and spontaneity.
positive;positive;i haven't seen such a self-ironic and funny movie in a long time!
positive;positive;image and music are also part of the successful overall image of arrival.
negative;positive;why is everything repeated?
positive;positive;with the exception of tiny little things, the film corresponds to the book and is even better than mockingjay 2
negative;positive;"already such talk as, ""cigarette?"
negative;positive;): 7/10 final result: 9,333 unfortunately there are only 9/10 point but it would have been quite easy to become 10/10, maybe even more.
negative;positive;much darker than aliens, for example.
negative;positive;i saw the movie yesterday and i wa thrilled!
negative;negative;especially since one, a already mentioned by filmstarts, is not affected at all by whether or not she dy now.
negative;negative;you mean that would be a devastating criticism?
negative;positive;exterminated.
negative;positive;brilliant film and now because of the logic we start with the first film some say why the pirate in the first part scream obwol he is dead that lie on it because man pain net5t only check she play herself in the head a well a man stop bleeding remembers it but doesn't hurt it mekt man it no because since the head play with he say there's nothing so you don't notice but the pirate see it and his brain what go normal it hurt without doing it 2 film like jann it's the babossar life you left him behind in the cursed treasure and you took care of it when you first see that you're cursed that your organ are missing from the brain so jack shot him when he wa still cursed after a few minute so you didn't hit the heart and you've left him in the cursed treasure
negative;positive;2.
positive;positive;top!
positive;positive;i found it great: the memory from the point of view of the boys, the cautious touch on the family of the girls, the small common adventures, the tender mief of the (not only american) suburbs, all presented harmoniously and not overdrawn.
negative;positive;this is a film of it collected emotion just kicking the viewer out of his socks.
positive;positive;everyone is enthusiastic about it. it is only done what is fun, with no consequence whatsoever, if there is anything to come.
positive;negative;director's great.
negative;positive;conclusion: snow white and the huntsman is a bit to treat like 300 or van helsing: he doe not offer a story that completely knock around, but the picture and the presentation have it in themselves.
negative;positive;i only looked at jcvd because i wanted to see van damme play.
positive;positive;great work from the entire team.
negative;positive;johnny depp a the only useful man in a village, which is terrorized by an alleged headless spirit - sound at first quite inappropriate.
negative;positive;the 15 minute on the empire state building you can get around pretty well.
negative;positive;all fear wa ultimately in vain, because the makers, who are also almost all involved in the series, which is obviously good for the film, have succeeded in making a funny movie that even small defamation do not matter.
negative;positive;but all the others are fantastically occupied and play great!
negative;positive;barfly convinced me and also entertained me well.
negative;positive;"i had watched this movie last week in the cinema and when i think about it, i am immediately ""exhausted""."
positive;positive;never seen, but i still know that i wa real to and fro.
negative;positive;just a she saved her life and never gave up really convinced me and i also found really great.
positive;negative;through long journey you get an impression of the vastness of the country.
negative;negative;so the film is about how all the film from this circle actually start...two brothers...the one tell the other a sentence,which then run through the whole film and dy then naturally...but so something of very predictable,but naja...after that come the other brother, deeply hit naturally in a new city...nothing doe he feel like..what change in this film of 5 minutes...from one day to another both uniconnections want him, he even get almost directly the girlfriend of the square deer, who is at the same time daughter of the unichairman...well, the rest can then be thought on...he make the one dance troupe better...blablabla,then he fly because of his punishment,because of his flame that bend again...he is at the end of the hero!
negative;positive;even for people who are not the great fan of animation strip this film is recommended.
positive;positive;just great.
positive;negative;even though his truly large masterpieces, such a the cleverly designed thriller drama 'memento' (2000) and 'prestige' (2006), a nested mystery thriller, have been back for a while, he created with the 'the dark knight' trilogy a truly new flamed batman cult, with the middle part in particular, at the same time the name giver of the cinematic trio, being considered an outstanding representative.
positive;positive;i am 15 year and actually out of the old for such movies!
positive;positive;grandiose action cinema... very dramatic and massively staged and even if something get too short of tension and even if a little character drawing is attached (which, of course, is heavy in view of the length of the substance), a very captivating film.
positive;positive;cool gkvyrolxbmv hbvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
negative;negative;the only positive thing you have to take advantage of the film is the evening-ländic atmosphere that it radiates.
positive;positive;with the ice queen disney return to the old strength.
positive;positive;the rare one are brought to the cinema by such horny cop thrillers.
positive;negative;and the real holmes wouldn't be jealous of a wife of watson (that's part of the story in mary morstan's example), especially since watson is also a married woman who participates in adventures.
positive;positive;what peter jackson conjures up here for picture on the canvas.
positive;positive;the highlight of the film are certainly the psychedelic image and dream sequence and therefore the film is worth seeing.
positive;positive;quite clearly one of the best film of the mcu and clearly better than last â€žage of ultronâ€ when dealing with it bursting surroundings from all sides.
negative;negative;it is quite difficult to survive the first (but very long-breathed) hour.
positive;positive;when the mutant can be seen for the first time in the direct totale, a part of it disappears, because one can imagine it much more animally, but is made up for by the representation.
negative;positive;9.5 out of 10 points!
positive;positive;the 2009 box office hit.
positive;positive;respect and hat off before this moving movie den they must have seen.
negative;positive;she seemed bored, but then she really got started.
positive;positive;simply artificial and successful.
positive;negative;but he get 2 star because he is very good for craftsmanship.
positive;positive;i saw the movie for the third time today...i wanted to see how he seemed to me this time....was a couple of year ago.... i have to say, even though the love story between rose and jack may still be so cheesy, i liked it.
negative;positive;"un-end-lich end-geile comic filming (the feuilliton prefers to call it ""adaption of a graphic novel"", haha)."
positive;positive;all in all, the film disturbia is a worthwhile movie to watch and deserves a high rating on my part.
positive;positive;id4 belongs with my absolute favorite movies.
positive;positive;it also act in part in term of the technological possibility frighteningly real.
negative;negative;i think i can agree to that if i say: i'm just a stupid a the mean american.
positive;positive;oscar isaac in the role of genius nathan, but this surpasses it all again.
positive;positive;"the ""western drama"" offer a successful change to the everyday hollywood cinema and look despite the 160min not long breathing."
negative;negative;in the film he still say that he ha gone through all calculation three time and that everything is correct.
negative;positive;so i can't make people understand the criticism.
positive;positive;overall seen a neat blockbuster for a popcorn evening.
positive;positive;it transport the mood great, so you can get into it extremely well.
negative;positive;because in winter it is bitterly cold and supermarket there are also not exactly at every corner.
negative;positive;so i learned some more good advice about current artcore, e.g.
negative;positive;i grew up with the old part 1 2 3, so episode 4 5 6, so to speak, then the episode 1 2 3 enjoyed time in my teen year and wa unheard of by the episode 7 and 8, a well a rouge one derbe.
positive;positive;actor fit, good special effects, great action and stuff.
negative;positive;after a short introduction it's round on the canvas.
positive;positive;"i also like ""archie and harry"" with the cuddly hollywood titanic team burt lancaster/kirk douglas."
negative;positive;but above all, this love must also be implemented mentally, which the mother of max unfortunately doe not succeed.
negative;positive;what fascinates me, however, is the moral aspect of the film.
negative;positive;i can only recommend anyone who want to see large cinema to lead this movie to pleasure.
negative;negative;"but in large part the ""story"" drag itself through endless scene that have no real connection and do not advance the action."
positive;negative;"the cast, the production team a well a the categorical classification into the category ""comã¶die"" actually let u guess a funny movie - that is ""adventureland"" but at no time."
negative;positive;when he meet his son for the first time after 11 year he show him the cold shoulder, but in max he quickly see himself again.
positive;negative;it all start perfectly well.
negative;negative;"the only film that, despite it small weakness and lengths, became a cult film and the hype around tarantino is justified and remains ""pulp fiction"", of which quality he is unfortunately mile away despite any ""that-is-but-so-wanted"" argumentation."
negative;positive;in doing so, he defies every obstacle and prof what he will later describe a his personal talent.
positive;positive;since i personally like boxing movie very much, i also watched this movie and noticed that he ha the best, yes you can say, boxing scene in the movie that you have ever seen.
negative;positive;this wa done without the use of 3d, because 3d would have been only stellend to the style and the camera guidance of the film.
negative;positive;everything next to ian fleming's figure of mr.
negative;negative;in addition, it would cost a lot of work to design a jungle instead of a desert.
negative;negative;the story is so predictable that despite some laugh mainly boredom prevails.
negative;negative;"in the original lina really want to go away - she is already at the station counter and want to buy a ticket from her last money ""to italy""."
positive;positive;i watched the movie yesterday in the cinema and must say wow!!!
negative;positive;"jared explains and explains and then come the sentence ""here come margot robbie in the bubble bath with the explanation""."
positive;positive;the two child also play a very impressive role.
positive;positive;what should not be missing: janus dissing rathke a the leading actor is fantastic.
negative;negative;they can still roar like lions, climb like monkeys, are strong like bear and bite like bald head's hard-dressed pit bull.
negative;positive;not for people who are waiting for a lot of action or excessive brutal scenes.
positive;positive;sometimes extremely hard and so simply not to expect with chackie, it represents a completely different aspect in the portfolio.
positive;positive;"finally, you have an incredible number of people and age in your mind, which is good - because the film is not without morality; it rather try to convey several message to us."
negative;positive;for example, i don't find the bush in the moment when it looked helpless in the classroom.
negative;negative;commented, i find more than questionable.)
positive;positive;so, it remains undeniable: in term of fine humour, no one doe anything to the british.conclusion: original story full of funny dialogue and funny idea â€ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
positive;positive;and, well, android are always a little weird.
positive;positive;class, on the other hand, are the reference to the lord of the rings.
negative;negative;1.
positive;negative;"i've seen the most different fantasy movies, but ""hook"" somehow couldn't convince me."
negative;positive;but that doesn't change anything about the fact that it's one of the best movie for a very long time.
negative;negative;"at least we can now sleep ale calmer ;-)"
negative;positive;in addition to this social-critical component, timberlake and actress amanda seyfried reclaim all sympathy on their side and review the impulse to overturn an out-of-control system.
positive;positive;"we'll see if his plan go up...and i think that the sentence from thanos to thor ""you're supposed to aim at the head!"""
negative;positive;a q in the gallery say to bond - the old schlachschiff ... - only that it wa not scrapped but made mobile again.
positive;positive;the beginning and general of the whole film reminds very strongly of the episode iv, which i personally already liked with jurassic world very much.
positive;positive;thanks sly for this great rocky saga.
negative;positive;actually i don't like movie where kitsch or everyday are in the foreground and have even looked at it because i reese witherspoon like but naja so you can see.mark and reese play very convincingly, and even after 4,5 or 65 time you will not get bored because you are somehow constantly being banished by the story and the acting performance.
positive;positive;of course, i also understand all illuminati reader who went home completely disappointed after the visit of the film.
negative;positive;"only the vhs edition are completely uncut, the uncut version wa also released on the paytv â€"" station premiere earlier."
negative;positive;"for example, there would be: -the colleague of the cocaine snuff and go to work in ""high"" condition."
positive;negative;"the whole film is a compilation of the wonderful and fantastic documentary ""planet earth"" which consists of several dvd`s."
negative;negative;i've lost my finger.
negative;positive;well, then we come to the actual review : episode iii this movie once again had this great feeling of the first time.
negative;positive;so much for the content, too much should not be betrayed here due to the tension.
negative;negative;actor: the hilary swank in the leading role seems misoccupied is also due to the completely inappropriate dubbing voice, which seems from film beginning to end only staerend.
positive;positive;a unique film, but many people think the film is a bad smack of matrix, i see it completely differently.
positive;positive;project xâ2 and i'm part of it!
positive;positive;i also found gregory particularly charming.
positive;positive;"conclusion: outstanding bond actor and a very exciting film a the beginning of a new bond-ã""ra."
negative;positive;so i really don't think he's bad!
negative;positive;this effect is most likely caused by the high frame rate of 48 frame per second, which peter jackson wa the first to use in this series.
positive;positive;normally, i am rather contemplative with exuberant praise.
positive;positive;also the degree of hardness is right at the right place and you notice that you do not sit in a soft-split pg13 mainstreamteeniactioner and that is also good!
positive;positive;the camera team insist on the protagonists, all want to participate in the reason that open up there, everyone want to be right with his guess - they are all voyeurists, a well a the audience in front of the screen, which awaits the very big bang.
positive;negative;the evolution of man, which in the end he carry on with technical means, with the striving for his own destruction, symbolized by a black block a initiation and hal a the end.
negative;positive;a brilliant a the resolution of the film is, it is at least a banal and the actually important question are not answered, only the obvious ones.
negative;negative;"however, i would have preferred a sing-free version ;)"
negative;negative;write your own review (at least 50 letters)the trailer for this movie looked not bad, and the last movie by d.j.
positive;positive;"""michael clayton"" is not just clooney, wilkinson and swinton."
positive;negative;it's a pity, unfortunately, that the star of the film, the retro charm and the scene reminiscent of indiana jones, get into the background.
negative;positive;a huge moloch who try to tell a godlike person how and where people have to live and act in him.
positive;positive;it happened at the time, when two outlaw brother fell into the hand of justice.
negative;positive;the sequel is now much faster.
negative;negative;the name is a cognomen, a nickname that is attached to the two previous names.
negative;positive;with dvd and beamer at home, you don't feel like it.
positive;positive;"bryan cranston doesn't play the heisenberg here, but the loyal friend of the ""driver"", played by ryan gosling, who delivers a phenomenal acting performance here."
positive;negative;marvel ha so with his bosses.
negative;positive;it is enough to publish completely two, three trailers, but not in this edition.
negative;positive;only today, just two hour ago, i saw and perceived this film for the first time.
positive;negative;at the end of the movie, you're going to be a couple.
negative;positive;at the beginning is briefly shown how max wa captured and then you can already see furiosa a she leaf the citadel.
positive;positive;everyone hate child abuse, everyone belief children, but what happens if it doesn't tell the truth?
negative;positive;the crowning conclusion of the line!
negative;positive;the film is simply boring away from the dialogues.
positive;positive;"especially the role of pierre's wa played wonderfully, a well a the role of the ""subsidiary"" ^^' and what i particularly liked wa the end, because the list of ""cast""'s wa interrupted again and again by movie clips, one is practically forced to watch the film until the end."
positive;positive;i had the pleasure of watching the film in french cinema in ov.
negative;positive;without, however, achieving the dynamics.
negative;negative;the background story, which is explained at the end, should not hit anyone from the stool.
negative;positive;the conclusion is unfortunately shown far too quickly.
positive;positive;both are incomparably large and make the film more than worth seeing.
positive;positive;a through and through great feel good movie.
negative;negative;sometimes i had the feeling that they have no idea of horse and this adventure is just in the first place.
negative;positive;the director's instructions, which they have of themselves, implement them exactly a they would not have been able to make it better.
positive;positive;this is in some place very silly and also often so special that you already have to be a real fanboy to capture everything, but especially if you can that is worth the movie again so properly.
negative;positive;but these are generated le by loud sound effect than by good camera settings.
negative;negative;one reason for this is that, mainly the minor character (so all except tris and four) remain extremely pale, you don't get backstory from the closest friends, you don't get backstory from the enemies, or anything else.
negative;positive;everything point to a rebirth of themselves - up to the buddha on the chinese/or japanese?
negative;positive;he got no directing oscar for taxi driver, goodfellas, casino etc., although they would all have been earned.
positive;positive;so so confident of the plate that it is a true joy.
negative;negative;director, camera, editing and acting are at a high level.
positive;negative;downstairs someone ha written, the first sex scene of the two is so super great because sexual tension flows!
negative;positive;bravo.
positive;positive;easily digestible food but for that really extremely funny and very entertaining!
positive;positive;scorsese film have always been visually impressive.
positive;positive;all in all a good, worth seeing movie, which unfortunately can not connect to the preceded parts.
positive;positive;but also rachel weisz, who stand above all in the indie and arthouse range always for qualitatively very good film make her thing super.
negative;positive;there are two main thing to say about kung fu panda: 1.
negative;positive;"i find that this film show exactly what the american don't like: the truth of what these ""super soldiers"" do with a people who had to suffer from saddam anyway, of course, there are passage that remind rambo, but the american don't even rarely do which or?let's come to this great government, which banned the film: instead of always crawling into the usa in the most esteemed doing something for germany!!!"
positive;positive;tommy lee jones is also used to being good.
positive;positive;it's an incredibly great movie!
positive;positive;in doing so, ofelia help the various mythical creature from their dream to process the reality.
positive;negative;since aliceâ€tms last visit many year have gone into the country and most resident are either dead or still hoping longing for the return of the small, tea-drinking englander.
positive;positive;the title alludes to the ignorance and innocence that go with childhood and end with it.
positive;positive;nevertheless, i would have liked, it would not have given him, if he drive the crash of youthful now still forward.
negative;negative;mankos: - action instead of action - character kylo is choleric, unsovereign, chaotic and ha nothing on the pan.
negative;negative;so i didn't even watch round two in the cinema, although the trailer certainly looked good and looked very good with the prominent face acuh â€ , but it wa a pretty turner then that the movie wa held back for 7 month again so that it can be converted into 3d.
positive;positive;"in ""crazy heart"" bad blake doe not speak very happy about his music and his performances."
positive;positive;stimulates to think and is also recommended for those who like to do this :).. top
positive;positive;a top actor and a top cast for our dear batsi.
negative;negative;why doe luke want to kill kylo first, where he only feel the evil?
positive;negative;i (including war, duel and a severed darth mouth) wa released from 6 year of age.
positive;negative;"and with the idiot bonus that you can grant him, you can ""deadbeat"" the 86 minute of some time."
positive;positive;(the secret star is attached to the septopus)
negative;negative;"""it just happens."""
positive;positive;the role is promptly cast with the eccentric actor mike shiner (edward norton), but this becomes a problem case rather than a source of hope.
positive;negative;all shock scene are predictable, even the entire story is deleterious and transparent, especially if you have seen one of the numerous predecessors.
positive;positive;some scene even bring salmonflash guarantee.
negative;positive;10 out of 10 point
negative;positive;the movie wa just totally over-excited and funny.
negative;positive;it is also not difficult from the beginning to immerse yourself in the cult world and sink into it for just under three hours.
negative;negative;the oberschurcke is not even worthy of speech here.
negative;negative;this film is soo boring that i seriously thought about doing the same thing to the other twenty moviegoer and leaving the cinema prematurely.
negative;negative;too bad you could really make something out of it but i had thought several time if i wa doing the movie to the end.
positive;positive;the film show very nice that the soul of murdered people cannot come to rest and learn how to make themselves felt even without having a body.
negative;negative;i'd like it to go up to 50:50.
positive;positive;i liked that.
negative;positive;while other director shoot one film after another without the audience wanting to see the films, gibson make one thing right, film that remain in discussion.
positive;negative;although the last bond film were already a kind of permanent advertising show, but at least entertaining.
negative;negative;the story is not dolle and the implementation is just a acceptable.
negative;positive;i don't think i've given any movie here yet five stars, now i'm doing it.
negative;negative;terrible!
positive;positive;thank you tim burton for this masterpiece!
negative;negative;conclusion: i would say who ha seen part 1,2,3 will be disappointed by this.
negative;positive;and what might bother some, an end, that all explained the movie then also not.
negative;negative;except for a few exceptions, the film wa boring!
negative;positive;why, but at payne, it's always like he's reaching me full.
negative;negative;maybe to borrow on halloween, but that's all
positive;negative;"control a the good ami, ""kaos"" a the bos russia, the one who ha the atombomen."
negative;positive;why filmstarts here only 4.5 star i don't understand.
positive;negative;in addition, the whore steve (jennifer jason leigh) and a serving woman (aitana sanchez-gijon) form a humanly warm counterworld.
positive;positive;lundgren a a demon-jäger?
positive;positive;in her mother's role she feel overwhelmed, where also her behavioral son contributes a large part.
positive;negative;in the film it is about stopping the release of a virus that a lunatic ha developed to kill the half of humanity.
positive;positive;to combine christmas magic, halloween horror and already at the time of the creation of the film a an outdated doll trick to a musical will hardly succeed anyone again a well a in this masterpiece.
positive;positive;get goal on dvd and form your own judgment and go to the cinema in goal2 living the dream in mai!
positive;positive;he drink his tea in all peace of mind, but rather look with concern to his future.
negative;positive;i have now seen the movie 3 time and every time, i don't know why exactly, come a smile over face in the final euqnz, and one feel a if one would fold a beautiful book.
positive;positive;a very beautiful fantasy fairytale.
negative;negative;somehow there's no mood in this movie.
negative;positive;you have the feeling at the beginning, the movie rumble you through a ghost train.
positive;positive;he actually ha everything that a really romantic movie needs: a cute lead actor *snacks* and a cute lead actress who fit very well together!, the bos stepmother, a bit of action, the funny friend of the cute lead actress (he wa really distasteful ^^) and a good charm!
negative;negative;important topic, unfortunately a timeless topic, sometimes more up-to-date than ever, the sadder that it wa implemented so superficially.
positive;positive;the experienced cinematographer (giora bejach) delivers an imaginative and versatile work, which would awaken the interest of every cinematographer.
positive;positive;enjoy him - and pronto!
positive;positive;i never really liked the old film and the show.
positive;positive;first, a very fast entry into the darker atmosphere of the film follows.
positive;positive;i love him
negative;negative;can not be without spacesuit in space.. to name just one.. minimally realistic then it should be.. no, part 2 i will not look at..
positive;positive;for me very clearly 10/10, because it is the most beautiful, moving and mute movie i've seen for a long time.
positive;positive;apart from that, it is more than unfair to judge a foreign actor after sifting the german synchronized version.
positive;positive;"in my opinion, the movie is just a good (or even better for avenger's fans) a it predecessor ""the return of the first avenger""."
negative;positive;however, these do not only express their joy to finally be able to watch a football game in the stadium (in the case of game by men's teams, woman are forbidden to enter!
positive;positive;due to the wrong guide of the first part of the film you are standing there so unscathed that this firework of tragedy catch you completely.
negative;positive;not to process the terrible trauma, but to hunt the psychopathic killer on his own.
negative;negative;that would be the right explanation for me.
positive;positive;slowly but surely film start are joking.
positive;positive;almost all oscar movie seen (american sniper & selma missing) and this one wa the best so far.
positive;positive;in any case, the film is one of the impression of the fullest real film of our time.
negative;positive;the last novel mockingjay is already being filmed (divided into 2 films), and the entire crew will be involved.
negative;negative;the film begin in a london orphanage during the wartime.
positive;positive;even if the hard reality is cruel and irreplaceable, he can still find a sense.
positive;positive;super final sprint of the magic series harry potter.
negative;positive;you should have seen him, however, in order to be able to decide that.
positive;positive;first of all a reference to my person, i am not employed a an obliged person (replacement service) directly in the rescue service, come and become in the form of internship and sanitary service but again and again with it in consultation.
negative;positive;i have to criticise the beginning of the film, which is really far too kitschy and which is a bit too ridiculous, after all, of a very serious story.
positive;positive;you should look at it.
negative;negative;"- - - - - - - the ""adel on the bike"" might like the film."
positive;positive;from 6 year on you can show this film to anyone who like good music and a nice story.
negative;negative;in my opinion this movie clearly came to early!
negative;positive;when the dementors came, ... .
negative;negative;that's the question i took from the movie.
negative;negative;that's not similar!
positive;positive;even if the production in one or two place leaf the path of the right documentary and perhaps becomes too intrusively sentimental or dramatic - the work shoot out for a short time beyond it goal (besage sequence are about the demise of two member of the choir).
positive;negative;anyway, i'm still looking forward to the 7th (but i'll also read the book).
positive;positive;david frost and richard nixon, played by michael sheen and frank langella (oscarreif!
negative;positive;you can look more often.
negative;positive;many thing are different, but by no mean bad.
positive;positive;this may work very well with the anyway a the thirsty and differentiated batman.
negative;positive;it's a really weird movie.
negative;positive;it's a trip to wonderland when choosing the right pill.
positive;negative;of course it is nice when a 4.
negative;negative;very funny, that ́s it then but already - m`barek fan will be good.
negative;negative;and given the threat, it look more like walker is just looking at his own career, which is quickly recognized by hunt.
negative;negative;but the movie is still interesting.
negative;negative;not really.
negative;negative;i couldn't really feel in one of the character and didn't get really warm for the whole movie.
negative;negative;find the movie pretty overrated here.
negative;negative;in addition, the not all too good review got within my joy circle, perhaps also this inclusion.
negative;negative;the mafia stereotype have been fulfilled.
negative;negative;there's no use in all the high jubilee.
negative;negative;but i can't even share all the praise for the movie.
positive;negative;but a a godzilla fan you prefer to stay away from this strip.
negative;negative;i'm sure there are big actors.
positive;negative;i then also nodded and woke up at the end of the film, where i only noticed the american flag.
negative;negative;the only plus point of the complete film are the beautiful landscape photos, which can really convince.
positive;negative;despite an incredibly beautiful and atmospheric backdrop, the film hasn't caught u in a single moment.
negative;negative;also this verbidnung of optic and content is relatively banal.
positive;negative;or the detailed infatuation on the street collinsport.
negative;negative;it's not a bad movie.
positive;negative;introduce tomorrow into history.
negative;negative;since one ha a mercilessly simple concept - and fails in the last instance so much, that one simply cannot believe it.
negative;negative;well, and that's how the circumstance make me a banal again â€¢ one such is one when you shred a woody allen movie?
positive;negative;reference: if you found the trailer funny to the film and can laugh at curse of the caribbean over the monkeys, then you should watch the film.
negative;negative;i had high expectation for this movie!
negative;negative;one should have extended the scene either far and so atlantis could really be allowed to grow or the scene should be painted.
negative;negative;it wa hard to get behind the jumps.
negative;negative;if there wa anything remarkable about the film at all, it wa superimposed by the oh so great effect and pathic inlays.
negative;negative;the second aid of the film is in 3d animation, from then on paul tibbitt try to copy ''the schlã1⁄4mpfe-filme'' in the boldest way, all joke are lost and together the story are lost, only the effects/animation are to be praised.
positive;negative;only the action scene pop very well and make fun.
negative;negative;if it is true that christopher nolan had the idea for this film already at the age of 16, he would have been better advised to have his puberty imagination buried in his school booklet or at least to tell it to an adult audience demandingly.
negative;negative;know one, know all.
negative;negative;it is shot only on innocent by the boss of militärs.
positive;negative;sir ian mackellen obviously ha fun at his role and provided for some laughs.
positive;negative;i would recommend to first look at it current account balance, if you want to afford a ticket for it.
negative;negative;and... honestly, ha anyone seen a pack of bad animated computer kit in the last few years?
negative;negative;"), that i don't understand the boy's disappearance at the end of the movie (both child fall down the escalator in the dark, but why doe he appear in the next scene in a seemingly completely different subway terminal; surely he thought:'uih is the dark... i'm going to run from the only two people i know and i'm worried about and watch what awaits me...'?!)...."
negative;negative;been expecting more through the hype.
positive;negative;the acting performance are weak.
negative;negative;there's very little coming over.
positive;negative;hobbit 3 is guaranteed to top it because there will be a war a expected.
negative;negative;each of the character got a small backstory, which wa not exactly in front of creativeness, for this movie however wa also completely sufficient.
positive;negative;"in the end you have something the ""like nice"" feeling."
negative;negative;the dialogues, on the other hand, were weak, the story wa totally drawn by the hair and reminded of kabel1 horror films.
negative;negative;and why is never an alien on the idea with all the great superweapons that only they can use themselves to come up with the idea of an armed insurrection?
negative;negative;it is not so that there are no funny romantic teenie movies, but she ́s the one ha the entertainingness of a nutella bread!
negative;negative;the motivation of the psychopath should be revealed by some short flashbacks, however, this is simply too clichéd selected.
negative;negative;not always, but there are so many scene that don't fit.
negative;negative;"the film is overvalued and statement like intelligent to the film, fade away me.i think the idea with the quilt is not bad.but time and again are ridden on this fallen duselei number after motto "" ok you can call me a slut, but i am not:"" the over the whole film. it is at all no tension built up."
positive;negative;but you can also leave this and simply keep the archetype for set up and pseudo-deep-minded.
negative;negative;he who emboldens, the overall impression is lost.
positive;negative;supposedly, the film is based on a true event, but what is written on it cannot be recognized and also eludes my knowledge.
positive;negative;like a kreutzworträtsel an altogether conventional film biography of the english mathematician alan turing, who cracked the code of enigma in the 40 and thus contributed to the victory of the allies.
negative;negative;therefore also the not exactly small length arise.
positive;negative;also in a comedy i would like to identify with the characters, i would like to feel with the protagonist and see what the figure on the screen experiences.
positive;negative;just like my previous speaker, i'm also a huge fan of max-punisher comic and wa unheard of by the film.the original story is different the darker and dirty look is not present instead of the movie play in sunny florida and tom jane doe not remind in any way of the unscrewed punisher, the criminal even before running camera torch alive to send a message to her colleagues.he make joke with his neighbor flirt or bathe in slbstmits.also the rest of the cast is colourless and except the fight scene against the russian there is not even proper action,hopefully the new version will be better ray stevenson fit visually better.
negative;negative;but the end of the film ha drawn for me personally so much by the hair, a that it lead the whole film ad absurdum.
positive;negative;tom hiddleston is allowed to play the most interesting character with the opaque loki.
positive;negative;that's all there is.
positive;negative;the film implies that every mother can forget her life a soon a she ha children.
negative;negative;we were all right in the end...
negative;negative;the spectator almost wait until another herd of wild german occurs behind the corner and is promptly sifted through by the american supersoldier.
positive;negative;atmosphericly made great, but otherwise more a medium-sized animation film.
negative;negative;much also look too similar and too dark.
negative;negative;overall, the film trembled for two hours, i searched for an arc of tension in vain.
negative;negative;spoiler: the most terrible is the end, so ridiculous that they don't come up, more than a smile that there are which don't speak a bit german?
negative;negative;in addition to this impersuousness, i wa also destroyed by the exclusive use of stereotypes: the poor thing from the trailer village, the lonely bitter cynical old man, the greasy manager, the stupid embarrassing idiot and not least the evil german boxer.
positive;negative;although 'hereditary' is in fact atmospheric and atmospherically filmed, the story and the dramaturgy do not accomplish what the hardly explainably good review promise.
negative;negative;like most other football fans, i wa looking forward to the documentary by wortmann.
negative;negative;where is the impenetrable action that captivates the viewer?
negative;negative;dante!
positive;negative;hmmâ€¦ technology meet vikings.
positive;negative;otherwise such a shock: incredible story, a (large) band of cliché actor and a catastrophic joaquin phoenix ... actors' studio mimic of the starter course, irreplaceable.
negative;negative;"the dialogue could at best be called ""the future"" from the actor's performance, however, seem rather horny and anything but fluffy or even plausible."
positive;negative;and how do they bring the story forward?
negative;negative;3 out of 10 points.
negative;negative;the one in a throbbing leading actress at some point went to me a little keks after all.
positive;negative;also the confusion of the victim of the relationship wa simply super iced.
positive;negative;build your own shit!
positive;negative;in particular, it should be pointed out the film music, which really absolutely fitting and brilliantly emphasizes electro and otherwise shines.
positive;negative;what verhoeven does, however, have to deal with is the actual topic.
positive;negative;how often doe she suffer and cry and scream desperately about the dwindling welfare of men in her life?
positive;negative;it just stay on the track and the best scene the dear, good trailer ha unfortunately already betrayed us.
positive;negative;- - - - - - - - - - had stress and relax?
negative;negative;the film is interesting, but despite good spooky performance at some point from the middle boring and fitting to the title strange.
negative;negative;the character lack the depth, the story of the trick, the joke of subtle touch - the whole film is more like a slapstick comedy.
negative;negative;but the end is so bad, incredible!
negative;negative;too bad!
negative;negative;"should you have rejected a visit due to the already described ""let it go"" trauma; don't worry."
negative;negative;beeping beam and naked grip are mentioned, but are obviously not in fashion.
negative;negative;the reason for this situation are zombie-like vampire who fall over people at night.
negative;negative;the question arises, why the screenwriter of this galaxy have not tended to accept themselves from topics.
negative;negative;the cut are too fast and hectic, the bond girl don't stand out and the action scene don't offer innovative innovations.
negative;negative;is clint eastwood coming next time?
positive;negative;disney destroys the star war universe!
negative;negative;so in my opinion this film is overrated.
positive;negative;the cgi wa pretty good, especially in the finale and the optical design element were also very pleasing to me, a they radiated creativeness (different from the story).
positive;negative;if you like masked meuchelmörder, you can go in, if you love good horror shockers, you should look at something else.
negative;negative;saga, after just 20 minute of playing time, i became aware of why the fan are so worried.
negative;negative;"every now and then also the appearance of the ""bã¶sen puppetmaster"" are set quite well in scene, but this is just not enough for a successful horror film."
positive;negative;hope they cook the soup again after the old family recipe in the next bond movie.
positive;negative;"a paedophile couple is associated with the german (""i have seen the evil"") and the russian are all criminal anyway."
negative;negative;the movie already ha some very nice scenes... i would probably find it quite passable if i didn't play the games.
positive;negative;the story itself is quickly told: a boy observes a suicide of a mafia lawyer, who ha betrayed him before his death the place of a corpse, and since then is in danger of life.
negative;negative;not only that the cameraman probably didn't know what he wa doing, but also the cutter, which one really urgently should forbid to cut film again.
positive;negative;in the end one is glad that one ha finally survived it, if one ha not left the cinema hall in advance.
negative;negative;we've had it all.
negative;negative;in the middle part, i wondered if the scriptwriter or the director or i were on drugs.
positive;negative;for now the merciless slaughter is given meaning: the search for the last son of a woman who could fall in war, announced by irrevocably loud and sad music.
negative;negative;but i rather found the beginning difficult, because one could not guess at this style.
negative;negative;who or what is the circus?
negative;negative;the action is powerful and good and scene set no question, but the rest of the movie is just weak !
negative;negative;snipe and antonio banderas a spaniard and a grandiose harrison ford who doesn't understand statham's brit-akzent-gemble, they all lack the event factor.
positive;negative;i have to praise the darker and fast-paced production and also at the actor there is nothing great to do.
negative;negative;in my view, the only good thing about the movie wa the first half hour.
negative;negative;but apart from the hype (be it because of the characters, the book or only fincher on the director's chair), all this is a maximum average thriller, which is sometimes a bit harder, but simply can't convince, because everything seems so unfocused.
negative;negative;krass?
negative;negative;conclusion: filmic brainwashes at the coming together what doesn't necessarily belong together!
negative;negative;you don't get anything.
negative;negative;let's think about running to the movies.
positive;negative;but the sequel is completely freed from all such attachment and just what it is: a perfectly constructed product.
positive;negative;conclusion: there is still a skid on it all over the place.
negative;negative;greeting andy
positive;negative;so if you know and love the book, you should save yourself the visit to the cinema, in my opinion!
negative;negative;and gerard butler ha enough opponent in front of his chest that it doesn't get boring.
negative;negative;very frustrating.
negative;negative;ready.
negative;negative;totally distasteful!
negative;negative;i can't understand how to engage such bad actor in commercial film production.
negative;negative;kale doesn't like ashley finding other friends, except him, and even having a party.
negative;negative;the story itself wa quite nice, but implementation, well, i don't know.
positive;negative;this question we also clarified in the course of the film.
positive;negative;"all in all, ""disturbia"" is a really distasteful film, which rank negatively with it genre colleagues."
negative;negative;too bad about the missed time :-(
positive;negative;especially if one know the relationship and know that the calculation of the quota in germany are still a lot more accurate than e.g. in the media-controlled usa, so this whole construct fly quickly into each other, despite normal weakness at such a large survey.
positive;negative;in between, the whole work run neatly into the length.
negative;negative;no avnung why you shoot a movie with which you can vomit due to the camera, which shake stronger than an extremely bad mobile phone camera and which is published in 4kuhd.
negative;negative;chicago, in my opinion, is not necessarily a deserved oscar winner... in this film, there's just too much dancing and singing and yes, now many people will think that this film wa no different to expect.
negative;negative;"immediately i had to think of ""the golden compass"", where the viewer wa left with more question than answer in the room and you never heard anything again."
negative;negative;the only thing that give this strip a plus is the effects.
negative;negative;tränen der sun is not a film that can set the bar for other war movie higher.
positive;negative;the movie is also full of primitive and sexist...
positive;negative;it is a film with which you can pas the time, but since the director ha not been in any way keen to experiment or willing to wane and ha also proved little fingertip feeling, the whole seems unfortunately very fland.
negative;negative;then it's about revenge just top.
negative;negative;i mean, the kid are just in narnia for a few day and fight with their given weapon a if they had spent year in it ... yes the oldest boy will even be carried over the leadership of aslan's rebel army.
negative;negative;just bad, badly played with an expression from the 21st century, hardly any tension.
negative;negative;part is trying to print everything on megacool and many spade have been taken over from the first part, but only appear like a cheap slippage whereby the movie completely loses the flair of the first part although i'm the biggest fan of boondock saints, the 2nd already revealed me in the first quarter of an hour.
positive;negative;fort of painted, one-dimensional kitsch, towards the ambivalent complexity.
positive;negative;a a story in itself this is ok, if not special, in the wobble camera look the number is almost irreplaceable.
negative;negative;or did the maker just want to make a comedy that take on different genres?
negative;negative;what you get to see, however, is le surprising.
negative;negative;we have seen the film so overloaded and clichéd that we left the hall before the end of the film when it became clear to u how the story would end.
negative;negative;this movie is complete nonsense, and then also quite boring.
positive;negative;if you are just about to make a nice evening with the exorsist, the omen and more, then you can without any hesitation reach back to the exorzisum of emily rose.
negative;negative;it feel a if one had only to create an emotional film, a story that should address a many people a possible.
negative;negative;the story is weak.
positive;negative;i'm still in the ev.
negative;negative;well, what can you say?
negative;negative;"this time a occult witch-jäger; with a spark â€žhighlanderâ€œ with in it â€¢ unfortunately only without a chance."
positive;negative;better than the 1st.
positive;negative;here little attention to detail is proved and many scene seem overwhelming.
positive;negative;even the actor with charm could not make up for this, because in the end i really hoped that there wa a deeper sense between the whole stranger.
negative;negative;somewhere i read that the film wa exhausting, among other things.
negative;negative;in between you sometimes feel literally like in the wrong movie, because one seems to have gone to the connection.
negative;negative;however, i have to criticize the camera leadership.
negative;negative;i want a nice movie night
positive;negative;13.
positive;negative;"also the sentence from the potsdam conference, ""we want peace for the world"" is a little too little if one want to draw a comparison with the war still waged today (enduring freedom "")."
negative;negative;if it wa still possible to save itself in the original case of the bodies, it is now impossible.
negative;negative;[...]it's always the same when the aniston walk up into these r-rated comedys, coquetting with the sexyness of the 40's and cramping off swearwords: none of these outbreak attempt from the scheme of the heartwarm romcom is a good or even a funny a he could be and it occasionally suggests itself.[...
negative;negative;but what then came out is probably not everyone's business.
negative;negative;it wa my fault.
negative;negative;the insight into bond's childhood and thus his psyche remain absolutely superficial, also the relationship to m, which is probably supposed to represent something like a surrogate mother, becomes not tangible at all.
positive;negative;"where ""avatar"" still work with a message, the happening here run like pulled on a cord and completely without a goal."
negative;negative;here would be to call the thing with santa claus.
negative;negative;one can over the dummy story, which, sometimes aside from the main character almost completely overreacting rest of the cast (each of the of the patch with tit and rubber lip writes it would have been good or even better than bad can never have seen well), the completely unnecessary excesses, the completely wacky, downright medieval patriotism (i'm really not an american opponent, but i also don't run constantly with a german flag), one(or more?)
negative;negative;on the one hand, the stowed individual ha spared no cost and money to play with his victim lifeguard games.
negative;negative;parker want to get married, the symbiote go to earth, j.j.
negative;negative;i expected more.
positive;negative;otherwise, it is technically quite well implemented, the scene have succeeded.
positive;negative;the synchronize itself also her dodel!
negative;negative;the actor act well in harry potter except for some exceptions, especially ron can really amuse from time to time.
positive;negative;simply a it is, it need the immediate and directly comprehensible connection to the reality, without which it play is created to involuntary comedy.
negative;negative;the three hour would have been possible even on 90min.
negative;negative;commenting the injured tarantino fansoul speaks.
negative;negative;and despite my wise foresight that nothing special would expect me, and my ability to win something off, it wa increasingly difficult for me to ignore the involuntary comedy inherent in the universe of the shield-winging creature in the increasing course of the action.
positive;negative;stargate by roland emmerich apparently belongs to his best works.
negative;negative;this would have been such a good movie, if he would only not be so completely illogical!
negative;negative;the story is lukewarm, the character and actor stay flat, the action is true for long distances.
negative;negative;not only do they bring nothing to the film (characters such a storm (alexandra shipp) or psylocke (olivia munn) are completely without character properly heated), no, they also bring nothing to apocalypse, which can also be taken increasingly le seriously, if in the first half of the film he only deal with redressing his 4 riders.
positive;negative;"for he is about the american military, about a single family, about two giant bat monster who want to mate, and about a time bomb; the film is not about godzilla._____________ who want to watch the film because of bryan cranston should let it stay."
negative;negative;you have to be quite an alien fan to survive the very long-breathed story without yawns.
positive;negative;the female lead laura haddock turn out in her role of viviane wembley a a mimic tube creator.
negative;negative;unfortunately, i wa disheartened: the camera management should probably lead to tension and reality.
negative;negative;therefore: 1 out of 5 points.
negative;negative;why isn't scotty discovered on the approach to the station where the dreadnaught is apparently being built?
negative;negative;just too embarrassing the performance of john malkovich.
negative;negative;the leading actor ha no depth, you have no idea how he became what he is.
negative;negative;the basic idea is great but the film is for the ton.
positive;negative;if there's a third part, i'll definitely give up.
positive;negative;at least the finale offer a bit more speed and at least smaller surprises.
positive;negative;mcguire and dicaprio alone are suitably occupied and i would like to see them in a more intimate and natural staging of the gatsby fabric.
negative;negative;so one day you let yourself be carried away to look at him in the evening program, in order to be convinced of his greatness.
negative;negative;the basically well-arranged story loses itself towards the end during the whole strip to an unfermented, unambitious bliss.
negative;negative;but i don't think it's a very good movie.
negative;negative;"i don't want to talk so much about the film itself, everything ha been said about it in the review... just to the taste ""true story"": fact is: it's not based on a true story."
negative;negative;spoiler: now she is big and is more or le with a boy who ha match-making, all clear... conclusion: epic is a loveless movie that seems completely irrelevant to him afterwards and probably only what is for the very small one.
negative;negative;he just want to shock with his medieval approach.
negative;negative;yes, two low-budget production to interact with extraterrestrial that are already more frequent.
negative;negative;in the sächsische schweiz (that would have become the horror potential)?
positive;negative;when i saw him in the cinema, i found him still good at first, a good, boisterous degree for the trilogy.
negative;negative;"abrams is right with his statement: ""this film cannot fulfill the high expectations""."
negative;negative;"in order to make no doubt come up, one of the protagonist say in a scene, since he is already spitting blood on the ground: ""i'm not feeling well""."
negative;negative;a loud a that may sound.
negative;negative;unfortunately, even after a hundred minutes, that just doesn't want to happen.
negative;negative;the other boy, columbus, is still to be endured, just like the two girls, but dialogue or talk about which i could laugh about, they also did not have in mind.
negative;negative;some side plot one would have been able to give himself quite.
positive;negative;still a lot of fun with the look!
positive;negative;"in the figure of robinson the utopia arises only before the eye of the reader, by the hero, because of his courage, self-confidence and the infinite hope so sympathetic, pass through the ""civilization process en miniature"", thus a manageable cultural genre."
negative;negative;the latte wa very high for this movie after skyfall and casino royal.
negative;negative;so i understand the hype there seems to be around this movie at the back and at the front.
positive;negative;despite the good acting performance of brenton thwaites, alicia vikander, and of course ewan mcgregor, who stand out the most, it is not enough for more however.
positive;negative;may be something for little girl but absolutely nothing for women's evenings.
positive;negative;now to the second part it is naturally against a revenge thriller but only a few story from the first part are warmed up.
negative;negative;although i'm a fan of natalie, i find the movie weak... kitsch ala club of the dead poets...
positive;negative;we understood it: cliché of an embarrassing wedding speech, impossible type, bride ha best friend of the brother....jajaja!
negative;negative;on the whole, however, the acting is rather in the lower average.
negative;negative;==references==
positive;negative;non- and jungtrekker get action food from the household can, trekkies of the first hour are brushed and sf fan are - a so often in the last year - confronted with the insight that the genre no longer filmed new ideas, no groundbreaking concepts, but relies on the safe cashier ideas.
negative;negative;what's left in the morning after the movie night?
positive;negative;this won't last a year...!
negative;negative;everything seems too overloaded, too gigantic.
positive;negative;what are you doing?
positive;negative;those who followed this at the time will not be able to win much off the film.
positive;negative;quite nonsense story with nice effect and a very good idea at the ''ship sink'' (battleship).
negative;negative;some joke shown in the trailer are missing.
negative;negative;soderbergh's sequel take over with his playful story, also want to seem cool and instead seems rather exhausting, because no clear line can be seen in the story and the director know no new side to his characters.
negative;negative;but if you are looking for action with a little sense and maybe level should put on another movie.
positive;negative;the story's got something.
negative;negative;"but this ""highpoint"" is unfortunately the only one the film ha to show."
negative;negative;"i'm not a racist or anything, but i hate the americans,ey."""
negative;negative;too bad this cult figure isn't the one she used to be year ago.
positive;negative;he save the man from his lash and must finally flee himself... laaaaaan-like and illogical...
positive;negative;certainly it wa clear that the film translation could not take over every storyline of the good and tricky story of the book, but what wa delivered here is already funny.
negative;negative;so if that were the first resident evil movie i'd ever seen, i'd hate the movie series.
negative;negative;the actually interesting character of steve buscemi ha an incredible potential, but is treated so superficially and prejudicingly that it hurt to look at it soon.
positive;negative;definitely not a children's movie.
negative;negative;so not will :-(
negative;negative;conclusion: not bad but really can't convince the film.
negative;negative;i've never seen such a boring horror movie before.
positive;negative;part 2 wa also not bad, did not quite a convinced a part 1, but still a good movie.
negative;negative;everything stay on the track.
positive;negative;just because something is successful, you don't have to do a row.
positive;negative;"here one is so bent on a great moment of surprise that one deliberately take the most inconceivable possibility of all and hold it defiantly to the viewer, only to then triumphant â€œyou have not reckoned with it, have you?â€"" to say.[...]"
negative;negative;:-) technically, there's only the soundtrack to make, which is incredibly loud and extremely intrusive.
negative;negative;there is a robert de niro-themen-party, together with â€œyou talkinâ€tm to me?â€tm- and â€œfockerâ€'-quotes, in a montage-sequence unscathedly quickly staged away, the trailer take the maybe best gag in advance and anyway the whole thing is only a aimless and connected kasperletheater, which is perhaps not boring, but the morning after that should be forgotten again.
negative;negative;"the scene of violence are at best indicated, hardly bloody and shocking; the maker lack the courage (no, the will) to show how child really kill each other."
negative;negative;just like all the other actors, especially harrison ford.
negative;negative;with what the plot go a little fluffy.
negative;negative;"in the hair the expensive wax / the expensive gel, on the body the clothes of well-known designer and a propos ""body"", then the main actor make himself over in gym sweating men funny and show on every occasion his well-chosen body therefore... must come probably from the beer."
negative;negative;but everyone else convinces in his role.
negative;negative;"the acting performance is all right, only ben affleck unfortunately did not manage to portray ""batman"" a a superhero."
negative;negative;how wa this event frighted and how big wa the hype !?
negative;negative;in armageddon you don't get any time at all to realize what is happening, there come one catastrophe after another, it's not more unrealistic.
negative;negative;thank you david yates for the second bad movie.
negative;negative;well, the music is abba halt, but everything else that distinguishes a musical film from listening to a cd is possible to bad.
positive;negative;perhaps this film convinces with it charismatic main actor and good acting performances, but for fimply-dumped men like me, who cannot get involved in the romantic mood, the film doe not offer any entertainment value, because the plot is, a with most love movies, predictable and the humor is also very fland and offer most of the time an occasional smile.
positive;negative;sometimes you can laugh, but that's what it was.
positive;negative;"i had thought i could laugh here over a johnny depp brought to life a a vampire, because everywhere ""comedy"" stand a a genre."
positive;negative;i still know how i walked past the poster with a friend in the cinema, he said â€œi heard it should be good!â€œ and i answered: â€œjo, can be â€œ but he seems to me like a movie that definitely doesn't have much fun!â€œ.
negative;negative;the thinking behind it, which i unfortunately cannot betray from spoiler-gründen, wa then not even so bad but this kitschy implementation really didn't work at all!
negative;negative;appreciated, i wa strongly recommended, the trailer look awesome: i had to see this movie.
negative;negative;unfortunately, it's an absolute mistake about this movie.
negative;negative;the most creepy were the turk with u in the hall who had to laugh constantly.
negative;negative;"only: the rule with which mr tarantino break are respected for good reason by most filmmakers; if one break them, then this should have a good reason, one should be able to offer a better idea."
negative;negative;but it's a turkey cake!
positive;negative;the doctor finger his daughter and love to do it in between with the village hebamme.
negative;negative;the action scene are quite well done.
negative;negative;zb had to kill at least two of the dwarfs.
negative;negative;it all look great but it also get boring quickly.
positive;negative;yes, it is actually the bösewicht from the first part!
positive;negative;the second attempt ha been better than part 1, but still not a real laugh.
positive;negative;i could even go on with the magpie like that but that's enough now i think everyone ha their own opinion for this movie and can decide for themselves!
negative;negative;in term of content, the film only transport the fact that life is a pleasure.
negative;negative;unfortunately, i now believe that the name nolan wa simply used for advertising purposes.
negative;negative;even the actors, had one not to choose worse and can assign their roles!
negative;negative;conclusion: no romeo & julia post-description, but absurd children's film on the trail of â€œtoy storyâ€ without any significant highlghts
negative;negative;"until then, we're looking at how disguised superheroes jump off the schuldach, all spontaneously pull out their cell phone and run r.kelly's ""i blieve i can fly"" somewhere in the background."
positive;negative;his role doesn't ask him much, yet he doe the best out.
negative;negative;the miscarriage are treated too briefly (described in the book clearly more dramatic) the film itself build up too little tension, to see the story only from clair's sight is a bit boring.
positive;negative;caine is absolutely outstanding, you just want to share your company with a glass of whiskey.
positive;negative;for an entertaining, sometimes funny film evening the loft is enough so easy.
positive;negative;until the first character died, i wa very bored and often thought about whether to go home, but i still had hope.
negative;negative;it is so no place for humor at all and somehow everything seems too much wanted, too very staged and just overstated... 1.5 star i give for the good special effect and the otherwise naturally undeniable good style of the film.
negative;negative;a bad movie with bad adaptation of some marches.
negative;negative;"due to the guest appearance the film seems rather cheap and one had dug out some ""b"" celebrity from the sinking."
positive;negative;that's what it's called, one of the reason why the trailer didn't spoil a good deal might consist of simply nothing to spoil: a small (largely played) girl land with a giant and his fantasy world and simply spends time with him â€ , the end.
negative;negative;what's that supposed to be crank cool new innovative fast to track plot is part 2 of any wanted artistsartquatchactionfilm of the psychedelic drug type might like.
negative;negative;unfortunately, you look too often the cgi out, especially in a scene, and that doesn't look good.
positive;negative;no really good introductions, tight but 08/15-mã1⁄4ige staging and decent actors!
negative;negative;the movie would have been so much more!
positive;negative;magic azubi with the charm of a tablet of valium (äh ... yes, harry potter) pull the cursor.
negative;negative;it remains, however, more or less, exciting until the end, because you don't know what you actually expect or what the murder at the beginning should actually be.
negative;negative;these little detail are totally missing from the movie.
negative;negative;well, anyway... then the scene with the police station came and a black miniskirt said i knew: yes!
positive;negative;from the beginning of the film to the end i have taken away from him the encapsulation of the small foreigner in wholes.
positive;negative;highlight in the cast and also acting is undoubtedly sir ian mckellen.
positive;negative;more humor, more charm, quiet camera, future, comprehensible told story, and like technical gimicks and beautiful women.
positive;negative;my child and i were disfellowshipped.
negative;negative;so what doe the man want to tell us?
negative;negative;the movie is coming to you?
positive;negative;the story is strange, the acting performance underground and the effect in the movie you notice the computer descent.
negative;negative;who is aware of this and ha already seen the one or other report via television, internet etc..
negative;negative;although the most extreme violence is indicated there, it is not really shown.
negative;negative;only actress and if men appear there, they are shown a blöde.
positive;negative;also in this finale there is a big logic error.
negative;negative;my advice: rather look at 28 day later again and don't let yourself be deterred by the worse valuation...
negative;negative;the supporting actors, also to mention josh brolin are neither negative nor positive.
positive;negative;in addition, the story is still interesting, but i don't find it deep-rooted enough and very drawn into the length.
negative;negative;but the film wa so flat that we allowed the book more depth afterwards than we had until then.
positive;negative;but let's face it, a lot of handmade action, paired with a bit of modernity (as in the 2nd century).
negative;negative;thank god i wasn't in the movie and did this movie to myself.
negative;negative;wonderfully made this movie, but must one therefore ignore these extremely obvious logic mistakes?
positive;negative;the first part of crank belongs to the top 10 of my favorite movies!
negative;negative;a the attack of this s company on the tank is also depicted militarily (the shooting booth is quite good), is a bad joke and then only the tip of the iceberg.
negative;negative;if that's not creepy, then what?
negative;negative;the film is simply stupid and doe not build anathmosphere.
positive;negative;at the end, a handsome work that hit optically in the dark remains.
negative;negative;snail-like and without height and depth the speaker would be through the story.
negative;negative;conclusion: electrifying main character and an incredible shy scenario towards the end.
positive;negative;after arriving with the ship in an unsurprising city, the samburu warrior lemalian (jaky ido) meet them again and again and help them out of the mess.
negative;negative;a already said, from the synchro i wa silent, a jj delivery wa probably so thin that it wa necessary to make the sound louder.
negative;negative;this is about death.
negative;negative;"the reaction in the cinema were a colorful mixture of: ""what a sch****"" or ""pffft... such a scrap"" or ""what a waste of time"" up to ""we'd rather have seen something else""."
negative;negative;in addition, there is also a very dreary behavior of the figures.
negative;negative;...and tragically, the only good thing about this movie is depp.
negative;negative;what would have looked like the plan if a former director had concentrated more on his actors, instead of stamping out from a twenty-page booklet an uplifted script with 300 page and without real historical substance.
negative;negative;so am i.
positive;negative;hugh jackman is quite good at the role of wolverine, but this character demand from jackman a persistently painful and strained-nerved facial expression, animal-like shell action with tried but failed coolness and strikingly-crushing broken & broken-type attitude.
positive;negative;this, a expected, but consistently drawn through end, deserves praise a well.
negative;negative;the fight between bane and batman wa too obvious and for a â€œgrande finaleâ€ much too â€œ normalâ€ , absolutely nothing that remains in memory.
negative;negative;a typical bay movie.
negative;negative;russell crowe remains pale, mark strong is absolutely nothing a a villain, oscar isaac ha too little screen time to bring his villain much over and max of sydow doe his best.
positive;negative;although i'm a huge independent movie fan.
negative;negative;only unfortunately it stop there already.
negative;negative;the end is predictable, but not bad, even though i can't understand the police officer's action!
negative;negative;in the overall ranking, however, i tell you, i would never see this movie again, never spend any more money for it, i would like to forget it, so boring he wa partly.
negative;negative;a i said before, i like terminator 3 a a standalone action film.
positive;negative;because it's still the same and the nervt.
negative;negative;where are the teen exposed a next?!
negative;negative;i think there would be few actor who would be able to do that.
positive;negative;for child in any case a hit and a few chucklers for the rest of the good definitely in it.
positive;negative;it's all set up and without real emotions.
positive;negative;"this film is also reminiscent of ""total recall"", but you don't always feel like it, because you can guess a lot."
negative;negative;be transferred to obtain some of it solidity.
negative;negative;in fact, no one is afraid of that!
negative;negative;the film can never make up it mind.
negative;negative;the film did not scare me particularly, nor wa much to be felt from the psychological depth.
negative;negative;although some are very funny places, but the story is so unfaithful that in my opinion it mess up the whole movie.
negative;negative;but it wa nothing.
negative;negative;overall, a low-budget movie that is not worth watching.
negative;negative;maybe the movie had some good moments.
negative;negative;a well-intentioned film, which ultimately only becomes a test of patience for the viewer.
positive;negative;it is depicted without mockery and shame: dylan is seen singing of the kingdom of god, preaching of redemption.
positive;negative;"in no case is ""self-conversations"" a mandatory film, in any case it is a film whose fun factor increase exponentially with the number of friend present."
negative;negative;this would be the material for large cinema, but unfortunately the film drowns in melodramatic strings.
positive;negative;otherwise, many topic are addressed, but are not played out.
positive;negative;you tried to pack this movie with lot of stuff.
positive;negative;but also his role is quite overreacting.
negative;negative;at every corner a child is fucked, at night you can not sleep and constantly and everywhere is shot for no reason.
negative;negative;from my circle of friend i often heard the same opinion.
negative;negative;the dialogue & action of the actor are simply stupid and annoying.
negative;negative;and beyond that even in the later course of the film and series actually were exchanged ... this already testifies that these character are simply not really important and can not really captivate a spectator ... with which already the whole adventure can not really function and build up keiennlichen tension ...
positive;negative;the love story is beautiful and very romantic, but you are somehow left in the air a a spectator.
negative;negative;right loosely based on the 2003 published 272 pager â€ž21â€œ.
negative;negative;"but a little more depth would have done the film well, perhaps even a little more serious in the sense that real ""embassies"" are conveyed, a e.g. at ""€žbig fish"" a little more insidious and honest."
negative;negative;the film is far too short, you have had the feeling that the film itself is in a hurry to get ready quickly.
negative;negative;there are no authority monitoring a private bank or central bank.
positive;negative;with great expectation i have now looked at the new grindhouse/splatter effusion from mr. rodriguez, and wa again bitterly exposed a with planet terror or death proof.
negative;negative;this story is nothing more than a fairy tale.
positive;negative;but at least in amir's case it's a wish-marriage, very progressive!
positive;negative;"the action of the film is limited to ""make a little noise and scare up the chickens""; so in some way the protagonist grasp it in words."
negative;negative;28 day later, i thought it wa awesome.
positive;negative;the film is carried solely by the acting.
positive;negative;they're still so innocent!
negative;negative;the character act very superficially, the story is to dünn and tension is further not present.
negative;negative;"jack nicholson a a psychopath is naturally in his ""standard role"" also not bad."
positive;negative;however, the political situation ha been drastically aggravated by the greek state debt and the resolution of edward snowden.
positive;negative;part of it will come here despite my darkness.
negative;negative;certainly the action is in the first place and it wa also well staged.
negative;negative;"year ago i had read the book ""the hundred years..."" and wa thrilled, the resulting film wa already le fascinating."
negative;negative;worst movie i've ever seen.
negative;negative;i'd have wanted an end, which would clear up more.
positive;negative;the film not only raise question and problem - it also answer them: with a two-hour omnipotence and revenge fantasy a an all-round solution.
negative;negative;the movie had hardly shock moment and wa brutally true he also not really is probably something for the horror beginners.
negative;negative;what wa only annoying after some time in the course of the film were the clumsy slapstick attempt to create laugh by dancing h. grant, cutting grimace and singing.
positive;negative;evil and good deliver themselves there an eternal battle.
positive;negative;i liked his performance a an arrogant doctor, who is absolutely hairy on his title.
negative;negative;"maybe you took a look back at the drawing of ""manhatten"" in the original comic, which can be considered the only excuse for this."
positive;negative;david, russell, judy and her assistant manage to escape.
negative;negative;actor fade, dialogue mau.
negative;negative;in new york, franky (now he call himself roy) try to negotiate a deal with mafia bos billy burke.
negative;negative;there are also positive moments, no question, that unfortunately the negative aspect can not trump over.
negative;negative;the movie had bad plots.
negative;negative;all hp book that existed at that time, read.
negative;negative;these are pretty much the most dramatic scene in the whole movie.
negative;negative;"overall, the film is not bad but just because of the length, the lack of creativity and the unbalanced style of scott is ""man under fire"" highest medium!"
negative;negative;"the shooting of the little dog, on the other hand, wa given a an overwhelming and cruel detail, so that the last one in the head also had that hitler wa ""bã¶se""."
positive;negative;it is so fast that the picture and color fly around your ears.
negative;negative;i hope for the next movie^^ the trailer seems to be quite good^^
positive;negative;i definitely can't recommend it.
negative;negative;visually, the film doesn't do much and it actually move in a pretty small world.
negative;negative;it's not a blockbuster, but it's not that bad.
negative;negative;christoph waltz' part seems a bit deplaced, the character just give too little about the length of the film.
positive;negative;the film will please the audience, who prefers simple, somehow staged good-against-beast slaughter.
negative;negative;i mean, of course, such film don't have to be logical but a little bit more i've already expected apart from that it wa missing from spannung. that's just a very rough description of my side, in the ground i can write about it which make the film so incredibly bad but enough else i have to give myself over.i hope that there are even more healthy future people who are my opinion.
positive;negative;and natãœrlich in the spanish original (with subtitles).
positive;negative;the actor did a really good job.
negative;negative;in any case, this film is too extreme in it statement that it could appear credible.
negative;negative;this is where star trek beyond completely fails.
negative;negative;it doesn't matter to me which direction a movie go in, whether it's late or serious – just the balance ha to be right.
negative;negative;but first of all to the plot: everest is based on the true event of mount everest unglã1⁄4ck in 1996.
negative;negative;it wa always the same effect a in the first part.
positive;negative;abraham a director of the series.
negative;negative;so far so good, wouldn't this place-wise stupid dialogue destroy some.
negative;negative;last but not least, ben kingsley remains.
positive;negative;"of course, they serve the credibility and the unwellness or the ""crushing"" of the viewer, but it reminds you again and again that this should only represent replayed scenes."
negative;negative;but all this is not enough to get the film out.
negative;negative;man of steel is not a bad a superman returns, which, in my opinion, is not difficult.
negative;negative;and the envelope, which billy hand over to madolyn and which is oh so important, doesn't show up in the rest of the fimes anymore.
negative;negative;4. when wormtail cut off his hand, he doesn't scream at any more.isn't it that he warms up in the book on the ground and whines.
positive;negative;winslet got the oscar for the best leading actress.
negative;negative;in the book there is the chronology of history and only one (very long) flash back (half book).
negative;negative;the past is told multifaceted, but without any real connection.
positive;negative;horror won't come up for a second.
negative;negative;not a good movie.
positive;negative;the input sequence is i.
negative;negative;katana?
negative;negative;from the film i then went away, because i could not understand what the director aim for with all the picture compositions, plot and dialogues.
negative;negative;even if the plot seems to be interesting to itself, it is unfortunately not originally knostruiert, yes, even in the long term.
negative;negative;conclusion: excessive, completely irrelevant finale, which exchange the creative, cool idea with which this series started against a lame zombie story!
negative;negative;"""we just blow up a few ""system-relevant"" city and say he (dr. manhatten) wa and the whole world unites in joy their hatred of this""...hah."
negative;negative;cgi firework?
negative;negative;so i didn't like the movie either...
positive;negative;"""the hobbit 2: the desolation of smaug"" can of course also entertain with the expressed sense of humor of the dwarfs."
positive;negative;it is a solid action haudrauf thriller with old-established ingredients.
negative;negative;the spark between the two main character doe not want to jump over.
negative;negative;although he wa not great and is also far from being my favorite comedy, he managed to entertain me super and proved much more charm than one could guess from the trailers.
negative;negative;take care of it, the same doll a saw hide in the movie.
negative;negative;"so rupert sanders, known through music video and commercials, is allowed to make a very own movie, which cost the studio million of dollars, but the guy apparently thought: ""hey, we haven't done anything totally stupid this year, how would it be?!"""
negative;negative;"if you want to see a more recent movie with cage, ""pact of revenge"", ""tokarev"" or ""joe"" are not outstanding, but still better than ""drive angry""."
negative;negative;otherwise, however, the film bothered me mainly by it (optical) kitsch.
negative;negative;the fact that the film is in black and white give the already dreary atmosphere even more intensity.
positive;negative;the comedian boon meet the diaphragm several time with facial expression and rather by slapstick than with punctuality, but the viewer must wait for some successful staged fun, i.e. for the back section of the film, the confusion comedy.
negative;negative;from the actress's inventory only john goodman, who play the cholerical-intriguing (the big lebowski let greet) father of the bosses, convinces.
negative;negative;and this is exactly what stiller should have reduced his story better: a short film or from me actually a charming commercial series.
negative;negative;ordinary joke and a semi-sense merging of the action lines/persons save the film.
negative;negative;the animation are for such a production under all cannon.
positive;negative;a rebellion look somehow different.
positive;negative;conclusion: rapid change of scene and great pictures.
positive;negative;imagine you hear your favorite song with which you connect good memory on the radio and a he slows down driving, just before the chorus come a traffic message and the feeling is gone.
positive;negative;start right at the beginning, bigger is not better and they still haven't understood that.
negative;negative;the notebook, a romance with a not quite so new plot.
negative;negative;the crown put on the whole spectacle the broken end.
negative;negative;lethal intention, but the result then turn out to be gross and disgusting because not one of the figure ha any likeable or possible property and one sits in front of this kaleidoscope of ass-holes rather baffled in front of it.
positive;negative;defend yourselves!
positive;negative;and that it's not true about the novel, just like the weak screenplay.
negative;negative;apart from the fact that it is probably nice to give this film 10 point or that some people see themselves over the not a few rather bad review of this film hurt for some reason (maybe you can also see one or the other truth at one or the other point of criticism), this film also seems rather weak to me.
positive;negative;the actor are good and played their part well.
positive;negative;but a drug there were mainly the classic alcohol and cigarettes.
negative;negative;"the second time ""army of darkness"", after many years, ha not convinced me so closely."
negative;negative;"for my taste the film ha far too little action (which really start after an hour)-for beautiful picture i prefer to watch ""our earth""."
negative;negative;it just doesn't seem a round a in the first part.
negative;negative;during this time anna come into the room of antonio and think she would be paid by his friends, but he know nothing about it and doesn't even know these so-called friends.
negative;negative;after all, the end is consistent again and the film is photographed quite well in places.
positive;negative;of course, all are younger and fresher and come differently.
positive;negative;absolutely exciting and fast telling spitted with good acting performance of all actors.
negative;negative;under condition suitable for falling asleep.
negative;negative;but of course the knot will blow through.
negative;negative;i have had high expectation of this film, not least due to the extremely positive review at filmstarts.de i have to find out unfortunately: my expectation have been unmasked on the whole line.
positive;negative;this is a film for friend of the arthouse cinema, these can expect two moving and very strenuous film hours.
negative;negative;i had not read the book, so i can write nothing more than probably failed to implement it.a beautiful piece consisting of beautiful pictures, but no trace of captivating or accompanying.
negative;negative;that's just missing in this movie.
negative;negative;only the first 15/20min with christopher walz are worth watching the film, the rest is so clumsy that you don't want to watch it at all.
negative;negative;"3/4 of the film looked like a particularly bad episode of the already bad series ""hotel""."
positive;negative;you just keep looking to find out what happens at the end.
positive;negative;:) funny, macabre, scary, beautiful!
negative;negative;neither gag nor cool talk.
negative;negative;a few thing i'd like to get explained in the movie: why don't the alien fight back despite their weapons?
negative;negative;for example, the sometimes missing language understanding between men and woman is shown really funny.
negative;negative;in this respect, i would recommend the film, if nothing else come on the weekend, but unfortunately the ''outbreak'' can not stand out from the usual disaster films.
positive;negative;so somehow a back and forth - know myself ned from xd
negative;negative;however, he could not publish the work himself due to his status.
positive;negative;"in summary, i would call the film ""very nice""."
positive;negative;even if his film are made by well-known actors, it is not a mainstream but a very own world, it stand with a strange atmosphere that is somehow cheerful, sad and thoughtful at the same time.
positive;negative;nevertheless, the film is on long distance trãââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ a a female film film is a woman film film. film. film. film. film.
negative;negative;often from one scene to the next, from one character to the opposite.
positive;negative;in his new job.
negative;negative;with every further stripe the wayans boy become more irreplaceable by now, because definitely unpleasant.
negative;negative;which make him almost a slave to mother angelika.
negative;negative;there would have been much more to get out of.
negative;negative;especially not to such a known, the question, why he is so famous, remains.
negative;negative;in addition, the character move so quickly from place to place that it simply make no sense.
positive;negative;at traffic accident at the intersection and in the tunnel you might scratch your head and wonder how such a thing is possible at all?
negative;negative;"), in addition absolutely humorous and irony-free and thus one can start with the character sometimes even nothing, because 0 sympathy or understanding arises; the only tension, which is held over almost 3 hours, is the hope that finally something happens ... from that one really could make a nice row ã la x-men, then would have been also more time for the backstories, but so i have a rarely worried to have 6.20 and 3 hour lifetime in the gulli to throw ... sorry, but the time to gaze at a white wall make just a much sense!"
negative;negative;that the story is banana, the actor act on spar flame, this is all justifiable and wa somehow expected... please don't misunderstand, although i also liked high tension and inside doesn't need a high gore content for me to be good, i love obliche verdächtigen or brick, dark knight is also great, but with rogue i just expected a little more blood.
negative;negative;there were good one there, only the execution wa miserable.
negative;negative;but death race didn't like that at all, because the rest of the film is built on it, very weak!!!
positive;negative;the construction of feeling against the individual actor is never presented in detail or the psychology of the individual actor is always somehow unbelievable or not to understand.
negative;negative;and so the film hang itself from an action spectacle to the next and then finally loses every ambition to tell a story.. micheal bay is already slowly no longer a victim.. too many thing this man doe are so inconvenient that even internet critic will have to scold this man..
negative;negative;on the other hand, the two main actor give partly so harsh and completely dry comments, in this suitably sterile butcher's shop, that one can amuse oneself can.
positive;negative;dollar out and make a good a no advertisement for this movie and wonder about the missing cinema visitors.
negative;negative;structure and structure is perfect, no logic leaks.
negative;negative;"shock scene were also not saved (highlight: a ""swallowed"" baseball locker!)"
positive;negative;maybe he should leave it on smaller topic and not always deal with the very big problems.
positive;negative;and that's how simple and plump many moviegoer are to manipulate.
negative;negative;even this whole â€œtrust no oneâ€œ agent-number i found only boring, because i â€œ contrary to my kind â€œ at any time knew who wa playing wrong and who wa not.
negative;negative;i hope the next blockbuster is then again with knall, bumm and much, much peng.
negative;negative;it's more like an average movie.
negative;negative;imagine the alp a a lowland.
negative;negative;you really don't have to watch the movie.
positive;negative;i find that especially the film with antihero have a great potential for tapping out.
negative;negative;"james horner's score (after gabriel yared's version wa rejected a ""too old-fashioned"" after a year of work) is also appropriate, lame, repetitive and uninspired."
positive;negative;well.
negative;negative;"to the movie ""the fabulous world of amelie"": the story is basically not bad and also sometimes something completely different, but through the length of the film (117 min) the actual story in it loses itself."
positive;negative;a classic tarantino, with sharp dialogue and great music background.
negative;negative;some scene i mean to have understood correctly.
negative;negative;there's no drama, just dull entertainment, and i've had enough of that this year.
negative;negative;all those who went out with the movie were disappointed
negative;negative;i think luc besson had a few instance of scene and then tried to wrestle these scenes.
negative;negative;and where wa the red thread, please?
positive;negative;one could still enjoy this encapsulation forever!
negative;negative;there's no such thing a suspense at any time, and bale go under in the role of fbi agent.
negative;negative;"at some point you're intimidated by events, you don't know what's coming from where and even suspect in the score a parellele to the bam bam bam... from the ""terminator"" movies."
negative;negative;the film contains nothing more than concentrated two hour of frustration, howling woman driven by the desire for suicide, who seem to break up in apparent problems, whereby i lose any kind of motivation to these thoughts, since the suicide seems to be a pure end in itself, in order to press the viewer on the trance and deliver a skilled film.
positive;negative;but you still miss the eccentricity, the style security of ''kill bill'' and ''pulp fiction'' enormously.
negative;negative;these passage are all staged in a dröge.
positive;negative;"but since he cannot fight, he form ""the union of the super evil villains""."
negative;negative;it's almost not happening.
negative;negative;too bad i'm looking forward to every superhero filming.
negative;negative;well, my taste is not necessarily mainstream, but the co-inmates in the cinema weren't much more of a laugh.
negative;negative;such film can no longer be made in the third millennium: creaking board and door that strike by themselves...
negative;negative;all the flashback show only the separation of neville from his wife and daughter, the overall impression is not clear.
negative;negative;you just have the feeling that labeouf doesn't want to play this role anymore and want to bring it over to the office quickly.
negative;negative;only landscape fan get their money's worth here.
negative;negative;"and when you go home, you can say, ""the movie wa really deep."""
negative;negative;so what else could have been that in the movie?
negative;negative;for tripper hang - oh my god...
negative;negative;but mystery and poetry are missing.
negative;negative;unfortunately, the film couldn't convince me!
negative;negative;the movie really didn't appeal to me
negative;negative;how can anyone rate such nonsense well!?
negative;negative;no single moment is called into question the course of the killing.
positive;negative;they make up the flair of hawaii first.
negative;negative;clint eastwood didn't like to shoot a movie that bad in his selection.
positive;negative;i liked the idea with the bionetworking.
negative;negative;i think it would be better if the film had either a completely open end or 2 turns.
negative;negative;in short, a rather bad movie.
negative;negative;unfortunately, how to do a second part well, mr. raimi ha actually shown
negative;negative;"for 7 euro you should rather borrow 2 good porno in the video library...;) there you have more of!"
negative;negative;"b) in the stylish apartment of the scientist (ethan hawke) there are several time the following occurrence: one hears a gently performed ""security alert"" from the off, and immediately stand - completely without noise o.ä."
positive;negative;arlo & spot is pretty much the opposite.
negative;negative;affleck earns $120,000 a year in the movie (gross) and john well try to make the viewer actually know that he ha nothing erpsartes, and can not even afford a game console for 180â‘¬ anymore.
positive;negative;...discovery!
negative;negative;i'm unchallenged.
negative;negative;so far the worst part of the series (5&6 not seen yet).
