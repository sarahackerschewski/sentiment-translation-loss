negative;positive;the door men were very helpful and friendly in getting a taxi.
positive;positive;breakfast is excellent.
negative;positive;i also don't know about the charge for thing in the room - i either didn't use it or my business paid for it, so i didn't pay attention.

negative;positive;this hotel is also unique in that it ha free parking, which can cost an additional $25-$35 per night at other hotel in the area.
positive;positive;first off, location is great, about a 15-20 ride from the airport.
negative;positive;instead of getting in line to check out, they provided your bill at your door on your last day.
negative;positive;they were so kind, and even extended out check out (twice) to accommodate our travel due to long metro line after the race.
negative;positive;given that the room wa not huge, i wa impressed with the amount of furniture it had without it feeling at all cramped.

positive;positive;across the road is the original pancake parlor.
negative;positive;\nthere is a bar and an italian restaurant on the ground floor with a small sitting outside area, we didn't try these a we already had plans.\nthe hotel is very convenient for shopping, restaurants/bars and for the metro.

negative;negative;there wa no gaurantee that we would have a room with a view unless we paid $20 more a night, so we choose to pay.
negative;negative;on a sunny day, only a twilight glow came in, since my room looked straight into another hotel room, across a dim alley.\nthe electric outlet recess into the wall when one attempt to plug something into them, forcing me to charge my cell phone in the bathroom-- which lack a tub or space to turn around.

negative;positive;one night on the beds/pillows would've been okay...two wa just too many.
negative;positive;\ncons: there wa noise - both from the bar, and from the circle, but it didn't bother us.
negative;positive;we were able to go out and see the site and then come back in the afternoon for a rest before heading out in the evening once again.

negative;positive;\nwe didn\u2019t have any noise issue other than numerous people talking loudly in the hallway after midnight (come on, people, a little consideration isn\u2019t asking that much, is it?).
negative;negative;a very nice lady told me no problem, she would take care of everything for me, but my room would not be ready for another hour and gave me point of interest in the city and direction so we would have something to do while waiting(we wa a couple hour early) after going out for dinner and returning, we found a different lady working the check in and she proceeded to tell me everything the first lady tole me wa wrong.
negative;positive;you pull up and are treated like royalty: door opened, help out of the car, took care of the bag and called you by the last name!
positive;positive;i took my husband last december and had a great time.
positive;negative;especially the person who not only charged u for the night, but charged u for the night we slept on an apartment floor.. over drafting one in our group account..

negative;positive;"dance club is nice and restaurant is awesome but the staff wa no where to be found especially late at night."""
negative;positive;bathroom wa spotless.
positive;positive;the location is excellent.

positive;positive;"""walter, walter, walter!"
positive;positive;"the front desk ha a small food/drink area, similar to other business suite now.\nwould definitely stay there again.."""
positive;positive;the regency isn't always affordable--i paid $331 per night plus tax in may, but in october, when i'm back in new york, the rate jump to $459.
positive;positive;the lobby and bar are straight out of some movie (or a dream).
negative;positive;"""das hotel hat die absolut richtige lage f\u00fcr shopping un sight seeing."

negative;negative;your looking at around $12 a drink, which soon stack up if you are thirsty & want more than a glass of ice.\nwe have stayed in nyc before & are aware that space is at a premium so i wasn't expecting a big room.
positive;positive;the food wa great!
negative;positive;all corridor are clean.
negative;positive;we were leery of trying somewhere new, but really needed to find a better rate.
positive;positive;also within a block are two drugstore (cvs, walgreen's) that have inexpensive bottled water, snack and even souvenirs.
negative;negative;we have never stayed in a hotel a noisy a this before and paid $600 a night for the privilege a well!\nwe spoke to the hotel management who agreed that thing have got a 'little out of hand' - but unless you're assured that the room you're considering is completely away from the clubbers and the associated noise and disturbance, then be aware!
negative;positive;starbucks in the foyer is a god-send for those who need a caffiene fix first thing in the am ...
negative;positive;while some people point out how small the rooftop pool is, i went instead for the great view from the rooftop.
negative;positive;about a 10 minute cab ride from the amtrak station.
positive;negative;"i wa told several time \""hold on a second\"" a ms. walkie talkie barked a new piece of info ...\nnot quite a welcome."
positive;positive;take your own tea bags!
positive;positive;once we got back to the hotel after our evening out we went to the big bar.
negative;positive;we travel a great deal, and this room had to have been the smallest that we have ever stayed in...ever.
negative;positive;but we didn't need a lot from them so it wasn't a big deal.
negative;positive;room were spotless.
positive;positive;the staff were lovely and the rooms/ toilet very clean, warm and homely.
negative;positive;"it a bit more \""traditional\"" than the ritz in georgetown."
negative;positive;only suggestion to the hotel would be: offer complimentary internet services.
negative;positive;and the bed wa comfy.
negative;positive;we didn't book any transfer from the airport, we flew in to newark a the review for these where very poor so we thought we would get a taxi when we got there, on arrival the taxi rank wa packed so we opted for the train straight from the station the cost for 2 ticket wa $25, and i have to say it wa very easy to use and would do this again the next time we go, we then walked from penn station ny to our hotel which took about 20 mins, after our 4 day of an amazing trip we booked a transfer back to the airport a our case where a lot heavier going home, with the hotel reception the night before our departure, the cost of this wa $80 and we could not believe it when a black limo arrived just for the 2 of us, it just finished our trip of in style.
negative;positive;the breakfast wa a hot buffet style, scrambled eggs, little sausages, breakfast potatoes, hot porridge (oatmeal) toast, french toast, cereals, juices, fruit, it done on a budget but it's really pretty good.
positive;positive;"very nice staff."""
negative;positive;all, very little things.
negative;positive;the location wa perfect for walking to 5th avenue theater and for checking out the seattle flower and garden show, which we found about it, from a sign that wa advertising it in the lobby.
negative;positive;free parking.
positive;negative;the restaurant, bar and lobby are nice, but that is it.
negative;negative;the lady told me that i can\u2019t cancel.
negative;positive;they are refinishing/repairing the outside of the property and then they will do the lobby, ballroom and restaurants, followed by the guest rooms.
positive;positive;all the staff were amazingly friendly and happy to help u out in any way the could.
negative;positive;for an older hotel i have no complaints.

negative;positive;it wa clean and had a very comfortable bed.
negative;positive;"\nwill come back again!"""

positive;negative;the location is great across from fanueil hall and close to the north end.
negative;positive;wanted to stay one more day but the price doubled so we had to check out.
positive;positive;i would even bring my family back.
negative;positive;i wa surprised that this room wa even available given that the room across from me wa partially demolished, the lower half of the wall in the hallway had drywall removed, with exposed studs, and the carpet in the hall and up to my door wa covered with cardboard duct-taped to the wall and threshold.
positive;positive;perfect for our stay.
negative;positive;there wa an array of greenery growing everywhere.
positive;positive;oh well, just take a couple of aleve each day.
negative;negative;they were in no hurry to help anyone.
positive;positive;\n my lasting impression of the hotel is one of relaxation, comfort, and being well-cared for in a great hotel by warm and professional people.
positive;positive;the 9th floor bar open at 5:00pm (it ha very cool smokeless fire pits) but during the day you can sit and enjoy the sunshine.\nour room wa super clean and very quiet.
negative;positive;we got one of the closest room to 101 (no other room were available) and it wa noisy.
positive;positive;we fell in love!

negative;positive;i found the lighting to be a bit poor in the bathroom, but sufficient enough.
negative;negative;i don\u2019t know what they put it in but it wa addictive.
negative;positive;"entering the hotel from the parking lot also creates a bit of an odd experience a i often found myself entering through the pool or through one of the convention hall rather than the front lobby.\nthe elevator were being updated with a \""new look\"" during my stay, and while they did have a sign up warning that they were doing work, it seemed that multiple car had been taken out of service at the same time so that delay were often quite long."

negative;negative;the hotel is located a block or block and a half away from pier 39 where there are a lot of touristy restaurant (do not eat at the outdoor stalls).

negative;positive;my first thought wa someone wa over zealous cleaning and scrubbed off the top coat.

negative;negative;housekeeping only came 3 out of the 5 day we were there, and we had to ask for it almost everyday.
negative;negative;however, the suite wa located on the 18th floor, right below the pool and locker rooms.
positive;negative;our room had two door to adjoining room through which you could hear everything, and i mean everything, said and done in the adjacent rooms.
negative;negative;got back to an elevator on floor 2 and waited another 10 mins!
negative;negative;\ncons: no towel racks, no toilet roll holder, poorly installed security chain on door, no peep-hole, broken telephone, no closet or hanger in my room.
negative;negative;the person at the front desk changed our room, which wa a little better for the most part.
positive;negative;not fun with three small child waiting in the car after a long flight.
negative;negative;i stayed in room 360 and woke in the middle of the night having been bitten very badly.
positive;negative;"""our first suite smelled of sewer."
negative;negative;"the \""everything is bigger in texas\"" motto certainly didn't apply to the room (normal size, dated curtains, worn carpet, ugly white walls, unevenly worn mattress on the tiny double beds) or the ridiculously small bathroom (about a 3 inch clearance from the toilet seat to the door when the door is open)."
negative;negative;for instance, our room key didn't work 3 times...and when i went down to the front desk the third time, the girl at the desk said that it wa clearly my own fault - that i must be keeping both key near a cell phone.
negative;negative;there were fire truck and police car that showed up within minute of u calling 911.
negative;negative;i told her no & that we would just keep the room.

negative;negative;rude and absurd, uncourteous and unclassy.\nwe ordered breakfast in the room and my $20 waffle had three pathetic strawberry on it and tasted & looked like a stale eggo.
positive;negative;the service wa average and never cared to eat at their hotel restaurant.
negative;negative;he wa nice but not helpful.
negative;negative;this wa not a big deal but we had one drink and then decided to enjoy a more peaceful evening in our room.\nwhen we got to our room around 10pm, there wa a huge party next door.
negative;negative;\nmy parent had purchased a night here a a gift to my husband.
negative;negative;i walked away after i heard that, very dissappointed.
negative;negative;last but certainly not least...
negative;negative;i showed the manager two call on my cell phone where i called enroute to ny to let them know we would be arriving late due to traffic backup in the lincoln tunnel.

negative;negative;surprise!
negative;negative;the pro are: the location, the fact that it ha 12 elevators, so you never have to wait for one to arrive.
positive;negative;receptionniste pire que nul, qu'il faut r\u00e9veiller pour avoir un petit-dej.
positive;negative;nice fitness facility and tennis courts.
negative;negative;when the room wa serviced the shower cap and soap were replaced which i thought wa wasteful.

negative;negative;when i found out that the conference wa at this hotel i quickly booked the hotel using many of my points.
negative;negative;it wa kind of spooky looking in my opinion.
negative;negative;"""this hotel is disgusting."
negative;negative;on the 4th we were dropped off by our airport car, baggage unloaded on sidewalk and car drove away.
negative;negative;when we tried to discus the problem with the manager upon check out, honestly expecting some kind of compensation for the lack of an obviously necessary facility, two people from the hotel started yelling at us.
negative;negative;she advised me to wash everything i had brought in hot water and throw my luggage out.
negative;negative;parking is awfully tight, and they allow big truck there.
negative;negative;how rediculous is that?!!
positive;negative;"rubbish etc stayed in our room for 3 days.\nfantastic location."""
negative;negative;before arriving, i wa sure that the hudson wa going to be the best hotel, out of the other hotel we stayed at throughout our trip.
negative;negative;they provide a bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo.
positive;negative;the hotel ha an amazingly rich history but neglect no opportunity to rub this in (a bedside booklet dripping with gruesome camaraderie give you every little detail).
negative;negative;they have no sense of respecting their customer and no knowledge running a business.
negative;negative;i wouldn't allow my pet to stay in this place.
negative;negative;yes, an apple.
negative;negative;"""we spend 3 night last september and were disappointed for following reasons:\nnegative: \n- breakfast...this is unfair from the hotel to say that the breakfast is included (some muffin only and no real breakfast room!)."

negative;negative;"i suggest you do the same."""
positive;negative;we tried to bend most of it, but our son ended up sleeping with one of u on a double bed (you can just imagine how uncomfortable we were!).
negative;negative;it had storage unit that had unspeakable filth inside, and getting an extra towel apparently erquires special dispensation from the pope.

negative;negative;all 6 of u went to our respective 3 reserved room and looked on in horror a we discovered that each room only had 1 bed.
negative;negative;the tv wa fuzzy with bad reception it wa noisy and no place to eat nearby, the gas station next door had bar on the window and thick glass.
negative;negative;my wife almost fell out of the bed \u2013 had she hit her head on the nightstand, she could have been seriously injured.\nthe next morning, we brought our complaint to the front desk.
negative;negative;the worst part: their room were not sound proved.
negative;negative;sometimes they are a place you just have to deal with before getting to your final destination.
negative;negative;the breakfast room wa far to small to accomodate the number of people and the staff person seemed annoyed that she had to refill item that were all gone.
negative;negative;i paid for one week but only stayed there for 2 nights.
negative;negative;shampoo, soap and conditioner are dispensed in the shower stall.
negative;negative;this hotel desperately need renovation to meet minimal business standards.
negative;negative;the carpet wa stained (in fact, there wa what appeared to be a blood stain between the two bed in the mail room).
negative;negative;we called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone up for u in the service elevator - no one every did show up.
negative;negative;"""siamo stati 4 notti in questo hotel...pessimo!!"
negative;negative;this mean you have to pay a second time for the service.
negative;negative;they didn't have any.
negative;negative;"""the hotel is centrally located, it not the greatest area of town and seems to be a large \""party\"" neighbourhood."
negative;negative;"""the clerk at check-in acted like i wa bothering him."
negative;negative;we also had to ask for another room on a higher floor since the noise from the patio restaurant wa incredible.
negative;negative;\nthe room wa very small and congested with old carpet and old bathroom.there were stain and hair all over the bathroom...but after all, the main surprise came to me when i wa getting ready to take a shower in the morning.
negative;negative;wa really disappointed.
negative;negative;for this we were paying 126.00 per night + taxes.
negative;negative;i asked to transfer to a non smoking room.
positive;negative;i had to get up early and shower while i still had light and use of electricity.
negative;negative;we were leaving for a play and dinner and could not wait around to ensure it got fixed.
negative;negative;"the location wasn't the best, but the subway station wa only a 5 minute walk...that is about the only positive thing i can say about this hotel."""
positive;negative;the hotel's back up generator supplied power to the common areas, but not to the guest rooms.\ndue to the power being out, we couldn't brew coffee in our room, so we went downstairs to the cafe in the lobby to get a couple of cup of coffee,and wa charged for them.
positive;negative;both were missing and cost hour of fighting through both the booking service and hotel after our return home to receive any compensation /reimbursement.\nbuyer beware.
negative;negative;"spend your money somewhere else."""
negative;negative;"""el trato que no han dado desde nuestra llegada ha sido mal\u00edsimo."

negative;negative;"""have stayed once before so i thought i knew what to expect."
negative;negative;instead they called a partner hotel and made u cross the entire city looking for this other hotel that looked cheaper than the excelsior.
positive;negative;\non my last stay i got an email from the concierge asking about my stay.
negative;negative;forced 02 dollar chargings to every case or box you need help taking to the room.
negative;negative;this is not an exaggeration.
negative;negative;\ni dropped off the key to the guy at the front desk and told him we couldn't stay.
negative;negative;they tried to move u to another room that looked just a dark and dusty.
negative;negative;when management wa made aware of the problems, nothing wa done other than to offer a half-hearted apology.\non sat.
negative;negative;"the front desk clerk wa extremely rude when i asked to exchange room because it wa too loud he told me \""that is your opinion\"" the bed very old and uncomfortable and i probably slept 3 hour due to tossing and turning."
negative;negative;"while laying on the bed we kept hearing a humming noise that at time wa on the \""quieter\"" side but then would would get louder - this went on he whole time we were there!"
negative;negative;\nwe should have checked out.
negative;negative;"it's ridiculous that they allow people to flaunt the \""no smoking\"" rule.\naside from that, we had access to the executive club on the upper level, with free hors d'oeuvres and open bar in the evening and free buffet breakfast in the mornings."

negative;negative;the pillow are lumpy and uncomfortable--i bought my own.
positive;negative;my wife and i got no rest whatsover!!
negative;negative;we waited about 30 minutes, but nothing happened.
negative;negative;i won't waste my money.
negative;negative;this necessitated a long drawn out negotiation with the hotel about returning the money and compensating u for the inconvenience and embarrassment caused.
negative;negative;guess what?
positive;negative;not for family are girl getaway.
negative;negative;"""stay away."
negative;negative;this is my second time to stay here and the second time i've experienced loud hallway parties.
negative;negative;then he had the houskeeping manager call to apologize, and again offer me a free night's stay.
negative;negative;"""i'm grateful my stay here wa free."
negative;negative;i have no idea what wa going on but it went on for a very long time and no one seemed to do anything about it.
negative;negative;not.
negative;negative;website claim this is a suite hotel with fridge, kitchen etc in room - not in our rooms!
negative;negative;the result of this wa that we had no place to sit or walk around in the room a our suitcase were either on the one chair or on the floor.
negative;negative;\ni made a reservation at the doubletree metropolitan (wonderful hotel btw that i have stayed at several times) that night and left early the next morning.
negative;negative;\none of the perk advertised wa a daily newspaper deliverd to our door.
negative;negative;our room wa not yet cleaned from the night before.
positive;negative;there is also a weird magnifying mirror hanging right in front of the bathroom mirror and it is quite annoying.
negative;negative;used the equivalent of two round trip ticket plane ticket to to rome for a two night stay.
negative;negative;engineering said it wa a battery issue and replaced it.
positive;negative;happened twice to u and our friends.
positive;negative;wow!
negative;negative;we only used one coupon and returned to the hotel.\nthe breakfast next morning wa also mediocre.
positive;negative;it is very far from downtown.
positive;negative;"the hotel doe have a super concierge and give you plenty of clean towels!"""
negative;negative;late at night and unfamiliar with the setting, i discover there's no signage on the hotel.
negative;negative;we found a prepaid package deal directly through the hotel so we didn't have to pay for it while we were down there, sound like a good idea right?
negative;negative;they charge $42/day for parking in their parking garage which is almost 3x a much a parking a half block away at pmi (parking management inc.) for $16/day...plus pmi offer early bird specials--$10/day if you park by 9:30am.\n***my room wa comfortable but it did not have a microwave or a refrigerator.
negative;negative;it wasn't worth arguing about since we arrived late in the evening.
negative;negative;"the drunken, falling guy in the lobby area one night make this apparent a well a the lack of seriousness in upkeep of this hotel."""
negative;negative;there wa no where to put bathroom toiletries, no shelf at all in the bathroom.
negative;negative;a saving of over 200.00.
negative;negative;i\u2019m not a fan of unsupervised children, and when i\u2019m trying to work out i don\u2019t want any distractions.
negative;negative;take a message for the morning.
positive;negative;hotel ha potential...great location!
negative;negative;"stay away from that place, even outside look show how bad it is."""
negative;negative;"they claim to have a shuttle that take you downtown, but wa \""conveniently\"" not running on the weekends."
negative;negative;\nmoral of this story- don't stay there!
negative;negative;\nthe tv system wa antiquated (as wa the tv) and wa far below par.
positive;negative;"""the location is decent and close to broadway shows."
negative;negative;on the day we left, we had to get a cab to the airport at 5:30am so we asked for a wake-up call that never came.
positive;negative;"""booked thru a convention site."
negative;negative;we had to turn on the heater to warn thing up, but it wa so dusty and dirty that i started sneezing and getting stuffed up.
negative;negative;i told the clerk that we were not stqying there due that there were bed bugs.
positive;negative;our bathtub also leaked substantially.
negative;negative;"\ni reported it to the hotel, and they denied it came from my room.\nit is not worth the risk to stay here!"""
positive;negative;our rep wa brusque and not a pleasant a the previous one.
positive;negative;had moldy shower curtain and need updated comforters- not a beautiful room.
negative;negative;the money wa in a suitcase, in a wallet.
negative;negative;and the breakfast area wa probably once a meeting room.\nthe worst problem is the elevator.
negative;negative;then my husband got irrate and called them back.
negative;negative;better to stay nearer midtown if you're doing the tourist things.
negative;negative;so i wa ok at that point.
negative;negative;"there were never enough towels."""
positive;negative;it is close to all of the attraction and the main highway.
negative;negative;the car is a total loss but i felt that it should not have happened if the hotel wa doing their job.
negative;negative;"fortunately, i \""comprende\"" and understood this insult."
negative;negative;"the next night desk manager said \""maintenance doesn't work at night.\""\nthe carpet need to be replaced to remove a couple of cigarette burns.\nthe wifi wa too slow to be useful.\non the bottom floor, we could hear every step taken in the room and hall way on the second floor."""
negative;negative;gag!
negative;negative;there wa an exposed heat pipe that we kept burning our hand on because it wa where we thought the light switch should have been.
negative;negative;it wa sort of dirty and worn.
negative;negative;i thought this would be ok because i wa getting such a great price, but these room were closets.
negative;negative;"i imagine this hotel is surviving by dint of it location; i can't imagine anything other aspect selling it."""
negative;negative;the door all have mold and peeling pain, the bathroom wa moldy, the closet wa disgusting, and i'm just thankful i didn't catch anything.
positive;negative;is phenomenal.
negative;negative;it stayed on full heat all night and made a constant loud metallic knocking sound (i suspect a loose baffle inside).
positive;negative;i got waken up every night with noise from the street and from the hall.
negative;negative;the two very young girl at the desk were not so friendly, stumbled to answer question of the area, and seemed very uninterested in anything i wa bothering them with.
positive;negative;you want a desk to work at?
negative;negative;en el desayuno te tienes que dar tortas y empujones con los otros huespedes del hotel para conseguir una misera silla donde sentarte.
negative;negative;"""i booked this hotel and had to cancel again numerous month before the travel date."
positive;negative;"i wa truly disappointed with the hotel & although it in a great location, i will never stay there again."""
positive;negative;also, no continental breakfast is provided and lastly, if you have a room above the 3rd floor, you have to go to the 3rd floor elevator from the lobby.
negative;negative;list of problem include:\n* hard beds\n* terrible pillow (these two point left with with back pain each morning\n* poor sound insulation from street noise\n* tiny bathroom\n* terrible water pressure\n* the kicker is the protesting.
negative;negative;do yourself a favor: avoid being bitten by both your greed and the bed bugs.
negative;negative;around 6am, the neighbor decided to pack up after their holidays.
negative;negative;had to request additional towel and coffee.
negative;negative;concierge gave me wrong direction and wa not very helpful.
negative;negative;so there is that.
positive;negative;but it ha not aged well recently.
negative;negative;"one night i recall some of them meeting up with friend (at least people not in uniform) and talking loudly at the door so the \""gang\"" looked even bigger and more intimidating."
positive;negative;it wasn't our honeymoon but it wa our first night a a married couple.
negative;negative;"i also noticed there were other people waiting in the lobby for the room to be ready and it wa well past the 3:00 standard check-in time.\nwe get to our room on the 8th floor; this room wa much quieter, warm, and wa also clean."
positive;negative;it ha been a couple years, but remembering it a a fun and cool place to stay, we decided to stay there this past weekend.
negative;negative;"after the way they treated me, if i \""accidentally\"" got a room here through priceline, i'd pay for another room in a different hotel for the same night, to avoid staying here."""
negative;negative;"\nearly the next morning, we notified the staff, who were gracious enough to \""comp\"" a room service breakfast for the inconvenience."
negative;negative;"i would finally point out that i ended up here through a priceline \""name your own price\"" purchase, for 3 star in this neighborhood."
negative;negative;the bathroom had the cheapest fixture you could find - really grim.
negative;negative;the manger wa supposed to call me about getting my money back for the night, which ha yet to happen.
positive;negative;stock.
negative;negative;"we really regretted staying here and wished we'd spent a little extra money to stay somewhere nicer."""
negative;negative;\nnone of these incidents, individually, wa a major problem, but in aggregate they made for a stay that wa consistently full of small annoyance and not what i expect from a purported five star hotel.
negative;negative;in my opinion, both of them should be sacked.
negative;negative;"my first bad review and hopefully my last!"""
negative;negative;this hotel need major renovation (we've seen stain in 2003 that are still present) or need to be rebuilt (which may be in the plans)!
negative;negative;when we provided our booking doc they told u it would be several hour until room wa ready (we arrived at 1pm & had scheduled an early check-in in advance b/c of our spa appointments) .
positive;negative;"""we stayed two night here, mostly for it good location to the airport and downtown."
negative;negative;perhaps we should have recognized that there would be some ups-and-downs immediately when, during check-in, one very hospitable clerk took u through the sign-in process while another asian woman clerk screamed into a phone at the desk within five foot of u throughout the entire ten minute of this uncomfortable and unwelcoming encounter!
negative;negative;"instead of a warm welcome we received \""hi, your name?\""."
negative;negative;i guess you need to pay more money for the free feature of a two star at a 3.5 star hotel.
negative;negative;no fridge or microwave or iron .\nbut the room smelled like urine even though it looked clean.
negative;negative;hier haben wir aber die grenze dieser einsch\u00e4tzung kennen gelernt.
negative;negative;we took the elevator down to leave and it basically stopped on every floor and we ended up being jam packed in like sardines.
negative;negative;the bathroom wa horrible!!!
positive;negative;"""i used to stay here while giving technical training classes, year ago."
positive;negative;i stepped on it and called the front desk.
negative;negative;i\u2019m pretty sure that by judging from the neighborhood that the only thing the local use this hotel for is to deal drug and meet up with hookers.
negative;negative;the cafeteria in the lobby didn't open until 7 am, and even though there wa a line up of 4-5 people at 6-55 am, the staff stubbornly refused to start serving until 7 on the dot.
negative;negative;"yet, i wa only there for one sleepless night in san jose, california."""
positive;negative;the staff did offer use of safe service at the front desk a an alternative, but this would've entailed lining up to access my valuables.
positive;negative;"""when you first see this hotel you get the feel of a very nice and clean hotel."
negative;negative;when i checked in they told me there wa a small demonstration across the street, and asked me if i wanted a street room on 5th floor or an inside room.
negative;negative;(wer kein gutes englisch kann ist schlecht beraten.
negative;negative;the girl wa of no help and referenced the fact we were on a price line deal.
negative;negative;"this place is very very noisey it doe have a nice pool and restaurant ,but if you want to be able to sleep save yourself some money and go some place else."""
positive;negative;\nthe property is full of hill (it sits on the side of a cliff) but i didn't mind that.
positive;negative;we had to close our black out shade because huge spot light were aimed in our window.
negative;negative;acutally, we just wanted a glass of wine before going to dinner, but after seeing what ha been done to the ambiance, i wa almost in tears.\nunless you are attacted to dark space and synthetic materials, i would give this hotel a pass.
negative;negative;i threw them in the garbage can the next morning along with papers, tissues, banana peels, and other trash, but when i came back at night, i found the same cup on the counter !!!!!
negative;negative;it wa only average and i expected much more.
positive;negative;"\noverall: good location, nice veiws, but basic, cheap, unhelpful, a annoying."""
positive;negative;"\nother than that mrs. lincoln, how did you like the show"""
negative;negative;even worse it wa so noisy at night and we hardly got any sleep.
negative;negative;this room wa located behind the elevators, the bed wa awful in quality, the shower wa about 1.5 foot wide and 3 foot long, and it wa super small for over $200/night.
negative;negative;the service wa terrible!
negative;negative;"""do not go to this hotel!!!!!!"
positive;negative;"the 30 welt on my arms, legs, face and back indicated otherwise."""
negative;negative;"""this ha to be one of the worst hotel i have stayed in."
positive;negative;you could even walk to fenway park from here without breaking a sweat.
negative;negative;the worst part of the hotel for me, wa the hallway outside the room.
negative;negative;"insufficient plug in room for your electronic gear, fitness center is a joke; room wa sizeable but stuffy."
negative;negative;the bed wa quite comfortable, but the noise from the hallway traffic doesn't let you sleep in anyway.
negative;negative;the waiter spoke almost no english, had no interest whatsoever in bringing me what i asked (had to ask 3 time for a glass of water).
negative;negative;"oh, and terrible."""
negative;negative;the gym wa not worth the extra cost.
negative;negative;when i arrived there late at night.
negative;negative;i did phone the hotel's internet company and after\na lot of holding they remotely fixed the problem, at least for the time being.
negative;negative;the corridor and room condition were similar.

negative;negative;no answer at the desk.
negative;negative;lol .
positive;negative;the room are also very small compared to hotel in the area.
negative;negative;the air conditioning wa not working but the window were hard to open and the heat kept coming on...even after it had been turned off.
negative;negative;when i checked in, i wa informed that my room had been upgraded (as a royal ambassador, this is guaranteed) and given that my existing booking wa for the best available suite, i expected something special.
positive;negative;room smelled like cigarette smoke, even though it is a no-smoking room.
negative;negative;you can't walk anywhere except a shopping center a mile away.
positive;negative;"""i booked at the windsor hotel after seeing it recommended in a rough guide book on the washington area."
positive;negative;well, it didn't work that way either.

positive;negative;first off after spending the price to stay here you would expect a bell hop to help you with your bag but no you ask for help and they look at you and say the cart around the corner go get them yourself.
negative;negative;i wa upgraded at check in.
negative;negative;about ten minute after we checked in, all the power went out, and did not return for at least 2 1/2 hour (this meant they couldn't wash any t towels)...again the staff apologized said it wa not their fault, something had gone wrong all around the block (aren't hotel supposed to have backup generators?)...
negative;negative;\nlorsque l'on sort de l'h\u00f4tel, l'impression est encore pire : le quartier est vraiment mal fr\u00e9quent\u00e9.
negative;negative;the main lobby and some room are located in the lower level.
negative;negative;we noticed tiny little brown bug on the wall next to the a/c unit under the window.
positive;negative;if you are lucky enough to be placed in the tower, you will find smelly hallway and door to the guest room with mermaid on them!
negative;negative;i wa so amazed i just walked out shaking my head.
positive;negative;i have seen bigger bathroom in caravans.
negative;negative;they still have no organization to valet your car--you wait at least 20 minute or so in the street before you can pull car in.
negative;negative;they sent someone to fix it but i bet there is still no light in rm.

negative;negative;the hotel feel old (walls, carpets, bathrooms), bathroom are small and front door is poorly insulated for noise which carry easily from the hallway into the room.
positive;negative;\nnext day morning while going for breakfast, i talked with the person in the front office and she confirmed that they will shift u to a different room and if we pack our bag and keep in the room, they will shift it to new room by evening.
negative;negative;the person who answered the phone did not speak very clearly and seemed like they were too busy to answer such a little question.
negative;negative;not very interested and helpful front desk staff regarding all previous points.\n7.
negative;negative;we spent maybe 4 hour in the room.
negative;negative;"""esta e la primera vez que escribo en esta p\u00e1gina, en anteriores ocasiones no lo he hecho porque entend\u00eda que mi opiniones no iban a ayudar demasiado a la gente a la hora de decidir d\u00f3nde alojarse, pero esta vez creo que s\u00ed.\nen primer lugar decir que hace casi una semana que volv\u00ed del hotel park central de nueva york y que a\u00fan tengo el cuerpo lleno de la huellas que me ha dejado mi estancia all\u00ed, a ver o cuento.\nnada m\u00e1s llegar no dijeron que, pese a haber contratado una habitaci\u00f3n triple no iban a alojar en una doble porque no dispon\u00edan de ese servicio."
positive;negative;"""we stayed at the beacon hotel for one night in d.c."
negative;negative;i have never ever felt unhappy about getting into a hotel bed, but i did at the midtown, and covered my pillow with a t.shirt and wore a much clothing a i could in bed, so that i did not have to touch the bed clothes.
negative;negative;the noise wa unbelievable, surreal.
positive;negative;this hotel need a good scrub.
positive;negative;i felt filth all around in the room.the pool is great and my kid loved it.
negative;negative;i might avoid marriott all together after this experience!
positive;negative;we then asked the snotty front desk clerk for a hospitality room or some sort of place to change our clothes and maybe even brush our teeth.
negative;negative;i mentioned that my traveling partner had recently had surgery and needed a smoke free room.
negative;negative;i called the front desk, and they said they don't have any suite with door on them.
negative;negative;clean and spacious lobby.
negative;negative;so we though we would try the pool,big mistake, we made it down the concrete stair without breaking our necks, to the pool yard and spa, to find poo, yes poo, floating in the spa!
negative;negative;therefore, on our walk up to the room, we were followed by a young man with a milk crate that had to empty the mini bar and whatever else wa on the counter.
negative;negative;i simple just wanted my money back so i could go elsewhere to feel safe.
negative;negative;i wa charged for valet parking and didn't even have a car there.
negative;negative;there wa no mirror in the bathroom, just a broken one on the floor in the room.
negative;negative;i stayed at the hotel for 6-nights, and wanted to leave early...
negative;negative;the reason wa that the price would be too low (?)
positive;negative;the problem with that comparison is that sex and the city is an old show that's in syndication.
positive;negative;"i responsd \""are you sure?\""."
negative;negative;i stayed there a week and it wa the most uncomfortable week i have ever spent.\nmy suggestion, save yourself a lot of trouble and money.
negative;negative;they took a bath and she screamed when it wa full of brown and soot.
negative;negative;"don\u00b4t stay there!!!!"""
negative;negative;"for the amount paid, would have surely expected better service and value."""
negative;negative;i thought maybe he wa the only bad egg but my check out attendant wa just a bad.
negative;negative;\u201cso, the customers\u2019 welfare and security are not an essential or important part of the business?\u201d my husband called to the marriott customer service and corporate service and he wa treated even worse.
negative;negative;creepy shower.
positive;negative;"all in all, i wouldn't go back."""
negative;negative;we thought we didnt have a closet but found a door to one and the dresser drawer kept coming out on it own.
negative;negative;"limited breakfast selection."""
positive;negative;"here's my advice, spend the extra 50 per night and stay in the heart of it all and away from the comfort inn!!!!"""
negative;negative;i could actually brush my teeth at the sink while sitting on the toilet in my bathroom.
negative;negative;finally someone from security came up with a new set that finally worked.
negative;negative;we took a taxi to a bus stop and it only cost u $40/way eventhough the journey wa an hour longer.
negative;negative;"""esta excelente el hotel, tiene unas camas riquisimas y la almohadas estan de lux, te invitan a dormir, pero e de muy mal gusto que te cobren 16 dolares por noche de estacionamiento, ese debe ser un servicio gratuito para los huespedes, fuera de eso todo bien."""
positive;negative;\n3) the room service food is expensive and of poor quality - certainly not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination.
negative;negative;the arrival experience wa fine, but it wa very very in my face.
negative;negative;there's an ethernet cable but that chain you to the desk -- no putting your foot up in bed to check e-mail.
positive;negative;this facility is very old and it shows.
negative;negative;room wa ok but no place for our clothes.
negative;negative;how much time do you really spend in the hotel?\nit wa dirty - really dirty.
negative;negative;"""ho soggiornato in quest'albergo a ferragosto: sicuramente \u00e8 in un'ottima posizione, all'apparenza pulito, sicuramente la colazione \u00e8 compresa."
negative;negative;we called for a plunger one day and it took about 2 hour before they showed up with some 6 foot snake to try and snake the drain.
negative;negative;there is no pool except for a hole in the ground with green water.
positive;negative;"""i reserved a room with 2 double beds."
negative;negative;at time of booking (early june) it mentioned construction wa to be finished by mid may 2011.
negative;negative;cheap price and cheap accommodations.
negative;negative;but, there were no room anywhere else available, or so we were told.
negative;negative;nothing could be found, therefore we asked that the motel not immediately charge u for the second night should we find a place that we found to be more appropriate.
positive;negative;\nmy family and i have been staying at the doubletree for many year whenever we go to boston.
negative;negative;"the hotel is so average and underwhelming would only return if could obtain a special rate."""
negative;negative;this will be my last stay at this hotel.
negative;negative;"""this is a horrible, horrible hotel in a great location!"
positive;negative;i found them to be very mechanical and not warm and hospitable.
negative;negative;the second room wa no better.
positive;negative;seemed nice when we first got there.

negative;negative;everything in the room wa operational so that wa nice.
negative;negative;at this point i wa told that they're very sorry, there wa a security breach a a thief wa able to walk into the hotel, walk into the safe storage room (it was, it appears, a cupboard that stored, along with guests' luggage, a large amount of renovation-related equipment and had workman walking in and out all day) and walk out again with several piece of luggage including mine!
negative;negative;the elevator make a sharp stop when you get to your floor so take it at your own risk.
negative;negative;"""don't even know where to begin with this hotel."

negative;negative;"the bathroom could use a better cleaning in the corners.\ni suppose some people really want or need this kind of thing: big, fancy lobby with a waterfall, someone asking to help every five minutes, a high-rise tower, to be nickeled and dimed...i got an insane deal for my room, and even then, it just wasn't worth it."""
positive;negative;when we checked in they told u that we had two twin and were offered a king.
negative;negative;it wa next to the elevator and there wa elevator noise all night.

negative;negative;i cannot imagine this room being an extended stay.
negative;negative;we showed up at 5:00 and were told that our room wasn't ready.
negative;negative;my level of expectation wa where it should've been - outstanding service, outstanding attention to detail, outstanding decor and outstanding amenities.
negative;negative;so we went to work and returned to the hotel in the evening.
negative;negative;but, when i returned home and looked at my statement/invoice - they charged me for the executive room!
negative;negative;the bathroom door opened into the closet so that trying to get into the closet and maneuver around the bathroom wa awkward.

positive;negative;), or their discussion on the restaurant for that evening etc.\nreception is unhelpful and the business room overcharge for printout and internet.....in short, good location, but otherwise, leave this hotel alone!!!
negative;negative;the patio furniture however wa of reasonable quality, and the garbage can emanated no objectionable smell considering the hotel doesn\u2019t distribute or even allow food in the rooms.
negative;negative;the lighting is terrible in the room, but at night the cheapo blind don't block nearly enough light so it's too bright to sleep well.
negative;negative;such a thing doe not exist!
