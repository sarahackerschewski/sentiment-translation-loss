negative;positive;even today, the end result is highly effective.
negative;negative;"a like many film funded by the government body the film take it self way to seriously, the script and it execution appear to be chore rather then gift and unfortunately for the talented thespians, their brilliant performance (particularly tom long a the fractured protagonist) are stuck within the confines of a pompous wan k fest."""

negative;negative;the backstories, agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 a an analyst who wa formerly morbidly obese, shame the complexity of the original duo and paint a flat boring reevaluation of them.
positive;negative;when many of the crew member are found dead, the 2 survivor are taken into questioning.
positive;positive;"and he play hari om impeccably- from his absolutely perfect ""bollywood e-shtyle"" to his awkward, shy manner with a first kiss."
positive;negative;not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other film he directed!
negative;negative;i can go through this kind of mind**ck if the film is funny or end up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in e.g.

negative;positive;one wonder how shocked initial 1957 moviegoer were at such a bold presentation of white-black relation (if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early, they must of left dumbfounded, if not offended).
positive;positive;"breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive, lizard-brain method of a female auteur in extracting from two ""cattle"" (as hitchcock called actors) a love-scene of searing intimacy."
negative;negative;burn ha a strange, stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective (just increasingly annoying, because nothing important ever seems to get said).
negative;negative;his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr. bennet too much a a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century.
negative;negative;"and the strip scene with mosquito doe not have any relevance to the plot at all; perhaps the director like this sort of thing.plot logic: when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why doesn't mark lester's mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loony drive it off?"
negative;positive;in the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull.
negative;positive;a for the fact that the comic do marry shrews, i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve.
positive;positive;never had i seen such a powerful true story movie.
negative;positive;the melodrama get a bit thick, and there are some gratuitous war reference thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but kelly take this film to the next level.
negative;negative;the concert sequence just sucked.
negative;positive;it wa not without it problems, but those problem had nothing to do with the time period.

negative;negative;the whole layout of the surrounding future world ?
positive;positive;"a film much alike to david mamet's ""house of game"" and stuff like that."
negative;positive;mr. bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with thing his own way.

positive;positive;"it wa shown at this year's cannes festival a part of the un certain regard program which offer ""original and different works"" outside the competition."
negative;negative;too bad they were in the wrong configuration.
positive;negative;it's not a pleasant wait.
positive;positive;rocky horror picture show fans, this film contains notable music, mind you, but it soundtrack is more plasticine than mad max 3.
positive;negative;a lot of actor have a multitude of good movie role in their soul.
negative;positive;it's really, really a shame.
positive;positive;most western use landscape a an awe-inspiring backdrop: there is little sense of actually living in the west.
positive;positive;if you liked the first three then you'll love this, go watch it!
negative;negative;if you 're not familiar with the original series, you won't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.the story is inscrutable and the vapid character do not develop during the film.kusama's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversation between the main character is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaw a a storyteller , it's simply unworthy of the original √¶on concept.charlize theron might be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the √¶on character.
positive;positive;it is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction.
negative;positive;"this is certainly better than their original 1960's acid-trip film that wa in it's place, is league better than ""honey i shrunk the audience"" (and far more fun), barely squeak by the muppetvision 3-d movie at disney-mgm and can even beat the original 3-d ""movie experience"" captain eo."
negative;positive;the ultimate matrix 10-disc set of this also hold nearly three hour of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a play all function, about 38 minute worth of bts material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes.
negative;negative;you would not believe, that this director earlier ha made masterpiece like urga and burnt by the sun.
positive;negative;"the costume are perfect,good actors, there are 2 music score the orchestrail score is wonderful, and keep with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive, the second score is a series of song by country music artest like merle haggerd, and the statler brother and those song like ""the man in the mask"" are so bad that they are funny."
positive;negative;man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen.
negative;negative;this is about a pretentious a movie a a shallow director like joel schumacher could make, i suppose.
positive;positive;"would we be dubbed a being ""off our rockers"" if people could glimpse into these area of our minds?"

positive;positive;this cast is far superior, a well.
negative;negative;"he throw around thing like this in between saying while street racer and the like ""blow their brain out with guns"", and how ""god is in control when your born and when your die""."
positive;positive;go see his film shade of grey a well.
negative;positive;samuel l. jackson is hilarious a the low rent private eye who try to help davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head.
negative;negative;then, there wa the cheapest video camera (which they used).
negative;negative;the acting sucked.
negative;positive;this character is really unforgettable, too.lady zhao, a wonderful gong li, is the uncorrupted morality, nor by power or love or hate.
negative;positive;the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on it debut, it ha since become a classic in it's own right.
negative;negative;the problem is that lenzi let u get a good, long look at the cannibal feast scene and it ha the convincing ring of a 3rd season star trek episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots.
negative;negative;while everyone else wa solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the english word faster.
positive;negative;"there's ""the gay guy,"" (pawel szajda a ""ricky,"") who definitely got robbed a far a screen time is concerned, and ""the one who know what's going on."""
negative;positive;>it wa entertaining and wa just what i needed.
positive;positive;"the film a a whole ha credibility and integrity, yet still ha that commercial edge - an ""indie"" movie for the mass if you like."
negative;negative;"of course, before that it ha the clich√© ""you really believe that?"
negative;positive;having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minute or so i wa wondering what all the fuss wa about.
positive;negative;more dancing, and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak.the film muddle it way to a finish, and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended.
negative;negative;the end of the movie just seems to implode on itself.

positive;negative;for a b-actor, i must admit i really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills...
negative;negative;i asked myself if the plot wasn't about the action but about the main character (played by mickey rourke), but i found that the character wa inconsistent - either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother.
negative;negative;nothing make my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing.
positive;negative;for an amazing serial killer film check out se7en if you have not done so.
positive;positive;a most meaningful film and a must see.please note the date of this review.

negative;negative;the critic and the public got this one right back then - it wa lambasted and a box-office disaster, and rightfully so.

negative;negative;(1) her mother rush to take responsibility for it and(2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film).
positive;positive;superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
negative;negative;surveillance only wish it were natural born killers... in fact, it ha wet dream about being even a fraction of what that film was.
negative;negative;any tom and jerry is funnier, heck even funeral are funnier.just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the stooges' performances: it's three guy behaving, running, even talking like retarded infants, causing all kind of unfunny mayhem, with no plot, no real purpose, and no real conclusion.
negative;negative;not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else.
negative;positive;ha to be the best of it genre.it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times.i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot point any day.it is a shame that the dvd doesn't have any extra but a they didn't have dvd when this wa filmed that is understandable.
positive;positive;people and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape.in 1979 herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
positive;negative;also living in pia's mansion is horatio (the sexy but dumb al cliver), a mystique who speaks nothing but nonsense.
positive;positive;"le a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpiece a vertigo, rear window, or psycho; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romp a to catch a thief and north by northwest."
negative;positive;"interestingly, there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times.by 1934 director frank r. strayer wa already an experienced craftsman in the poverty row side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer charles belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies, and ""the ghost walks"" wa one of them."
negative;negative;not so fast bucky.
negative;negative;come on, just be realistic at least.
negative;negative;who am i to say they aren't?
negative;negative;many scene are very unrealistic, and the acting is quite poor.

negative;negative;the initial exposition plant the notion in the viewer mind that everybody ha something against him, so when the revelation come that he ha been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original.
negative;negative;another that feature him riding around the countryside on his scooter.
positive;positive;how can these fragile creature cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner street of paris?
positive;positive;strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job.as for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting.
negative;positive;in fact rising damp should have been made a a film just so rossiter could have been eligible for an oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent.
negative;negative;admittedly, i only watched about two hour at the most of it, but that wa enough for me to realize that the series wa nothing like baroness orzcy had portrayed her characters, and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it wa filming and airing.
positive;positive;i absolutely love this film.
negative;positive;"the opening at cern where the ""god particle"" or largest quantity of antimatter is created with stunning visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie."
negative;negative;sleep or play solitary are best choices.
negative;negative;please, even if your life depends on it, do not, and i repeat: do not under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage.
negative;positive;if you are expecting croaky ghost lady to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere.
negative;negative;nothing interesting happens.
negative;positive;jiri schmitzer hijack the film at this point, and never quite let it go.
positive;positive;both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away.
negative;negative;this movie isn't scary at all!
negative;negative;neither were the character of marguerite and chauvelin adequately portrayed.
negative;negative;another stinker from the pm entertainment group, and thankfully one of their last.'firetrap' is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'the towering inferno' i don't mind low budget b movie a long a some effort is put into them - there is no effort whatsoever in 'firetrap' is star dean'superman'cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously he ha all the acting ability of a porn star, but he turn out to be the best actor here and that's saying something, the rest are just a bunch of no hoper given the boot from various daytime soaps.
negative;negative;"acolyte present an interesting mix of original concept in ""screaming teen"" clich√© horror with a more thriller-like pacing."
negative;negative;i don't know who wa in charge of special effects, but i could have done better in my backyard with my vhs camcorder that doesn't have a battery.9.
positive;positive;juhi chawla doe a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny deol play the hero and action man.
negative;positive;that wa u up there on the screen.
negative;positive;the thirteen-minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of it release, wa directed by john landis, a filmmaker i'm not terribly familiar with, though 'the blue brother (1980)' is a classic, and i hear that 'an american werewolf in london (1981)' is a stupendously entertaining horror/comedy.whether or not 'thriller' actually qualifies a a music video is certainly up for debate, taking into account it extensive length {though jackson bettered this effort with 1997's 'ghosts,' at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song comprises le than half of the total running time.
negative;positive;on a trivia note is character actor and dwarf angelo rossitto in his first film, his last, mad max beyond thunderdome (1985).
positive;negative;naraku ha just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world.
negative;negative;it's worth the five buck to see the woman turn into a huge cg snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though.
positive;positive;besides heifetz, one thing the film doe do is touch on, albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses.
negative;positive;if you shoot him now, thing will quiet down.
positive;positive;"the south-supporting lady find a badly wounded union soldier (clint eastwood); nursing him back to health he begin to manipulate the sexually frustrated woman for his own ends.geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed."
positive;negative;that is, however, if they can make it to graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of student with his fencing sword... yeah, it all stem from a the high school track star who drop dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister return home from the navy for graduation.
negative;positive;gibson wa already a strong and subtle actor in 1993.
negative;negative;that's a good thing, because this movie wa bad on a long leash.
positive;negative;jane brings out the humanity in him, and he brings out the untamed side of her.
negative;negative;without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared a though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose end are resolved.
negative;positive;for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith a the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn`t need tissue it need insulin .
positive;positive;"""black water"" is a movie that in a way surprised me, and definitely exceeded my original expectations."
negative;negative;"this ""film"" would make helen keller get up and walk out of the theater.6."
positive;negative;this wa probably one of irwin allen's biggest film and i think he thought a lot of it .
negative;positive;i realise how he felt.returning to the tv series, each episode show evidence of meticulous planning in term of writing and execution in every single scene.
negative;negative;"a pretentious but - to varying degree - watchable collection of mostly pointless ""stories"".but let's start from the top.kaurismaki: if one ever wondered what finnish love/romance wa like, perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication."
positive;negative;that's fine.
negative;positive;many of u will miss his off-balance humor.
positive;positive;aside from the virus, charles korvin is the main villain of the piece, a sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who, rest assured, get everything that's coming to him.
negative;negative;these guy could make a highway between los angeles and la vega in 3 hour equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck!after that hellish obstacle is fixed, master will try to land the plane a heroine pout away.
negative;positive;"the story end with a movement to the next thing, a distinct from resolution, which isn't the author's cup of tea; and those who like their film neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise."
positive;positive;bancroft is an especially shrewd choice a corrina.
positive;positive;i found my interest engaged a the film cut back and forth between ford's and thomas's life a they first found out about, and dealt in very different way in very different environment with, their spouses' death and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people.
negative;negative;heck one guy even try to give food to the zombie.overall, this movie make even the worst of scifi channel movie look fantastic.
positive;positive;max shreck later make penguin the mayor of gotham.
negative;negative;it look like a play that ha been converted to a movie only by using several cheap location (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house.
negative;negative;there is even no typical horror clich√©s,too.
positive;positive;i just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost), because this movie take full advantage of that format.
negative;positive;it also made me cry.
negative;negative;however, i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances.
negative;positive;so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of year previously turned up on the tv schedule i sat down waiting to be bored senseless .
positive;negative;i think that fan of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fan of lenzi's film looking for something new by the formidable director.
positive;positive;even if you think no, i'm not going to watch a film from dad's time.
negative;positive;he work in a foundry where he hit red hot metal into shape (an early joke about langdon - he is a small, light man, not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer).
negative;positive;half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and thresa wright's involvement with dana andrew mean that her entrance into adulthood ha resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...this is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the indianapolis 500...the character in the movie are the typical post wwii american in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive change to their lives...happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the le ugly choice!
positive;negative;a lot, a lot!
positive;negative;the love that ray and pooja feel for one another, a well a the almost giddy closeness of the family unit, is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapse under the weight of the sentimentality.
negative;negative;the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes.
negative;negative;"i listened to rap and r&b growing up, but the group ""immature"" never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player."
negative;positive;whatever you think, all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it.
positive;positive;movie that play and challenge your mind are movie you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality.
positive;positive;the story of two brother who meet after the war between the state and end up on different side of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless, and the shootout and the atmosphere are great.
negative;positive;it wa staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them wa even nominated for an academy award.this is a film that demand to be seen and analyzed closely.
positive;positive;the performance of rip torn and tantoo cardinal are excellent and their performance combined with the music, scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling.
negative;positive;i keep note on all the film i see and rate them.
negative;positive;fonda play a tv reporter who want to be an investigative journalist but is only allowed to be a tv reporter.
positive;positive;later tommy get himself into some real trouble when he disobeys order in an effort save his buddy.this film is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that held my interest and top-notch performance by all.
negative;negative;i began watching this movie on t.v.
positive;negative;a well-heeled london solicitor, (tom wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she ha also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident.
negative;positive;and when we do it no where near a good a this games.
positive;positive;seen all 4 installments, this one is by far the best of all.
positive;negative;-vivian is 19.
negative;negative;simply put, this film is so bad that i almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it.
negative;negative;the screening i caught this at had the director and cast in attendance.
negative;negative;for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.i must say that i wa a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part.
positive;positive;i have seen several yul brynner films--yet this is his best performance a the camera capture his emotion in close up a he snarls, smiles, and laughs.
negative;negative;don't watch this.
positive;negative;(hamilton ontario???)
negative;positive;witherspoon is wasted in this role.
negative;negative;i agree with several of you that this film wa rather boring and dull.
negative;positive;i want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on n.y. streets, circa 1959 & experience a time i've only seen on film & in photographs.
negative;negative;and i guess they also saved a few buck by showing the same sex scene three times.
positive;positive;bullitt ha a beginning that build build builds.
negative;positive;totally different than anything i had seen before, leaving far to many question for such a young mind.
positive;positive;without giving the plot away, this is a good example of how gender switching change a story.
negative;positive;i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies.
positive;positive;right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background at the top, a our two lover skip their way up the screen and into the distance.
negative;positive;even year later, i remember this movie well.
positive;positive;the special effect are awesome, but what is even better is the writing.
negative;negative;"the plot wa thin at best and with the low caliber of acting at time it begged the question to be asked, ""why are we doing this?""."
negative;negative;i rented the dvd because i thought it wa all stop motion animation or sma mixed with live action and only the first short wa sma, the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action.
positive;positive;also worth a look for fan of dermot mulroney or sean astin.
positive;negative;towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity.
positive;positive;it's a remarkable piece of work, that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist, people leaping out of bath tubs, or superheros coming to save the day.there's a fair amount of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go just right - not all gulf can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully show the lot.if you watch this film, and are not impressed.....
negative;positive;the music wa intense, it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating.
negative;negative;john garfield, jr. look a bit like his father, but not a interesting.
negative;negative;if we don't, the gag, like the movie, fall flat.there are action scene naturally.
negative;negative;that about sum it up.
positive;positive;"""l'appartement"" suck you in from the beginning and the twist and turn keep you thrilled until the very end."
negative;negative;and only two part made me collapse with laughter.
positive;negative;but, if you feel rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then imperium will obviously appear to you a an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.there are some actor who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome.
negative;negative;"the ""heroine"" seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of judy garland, the ""hero"" is bland a white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene out of the deal."
negative;positive;(it's no secret that by this time he wa severely addicted to heroin).
negative;negative;the twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly a though they got bored with it.
positive;positive;once again, hitchcock prof his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing.
positive;negative;"""harry & the hendersons"" (1987) wa the first big budgeted film to use bigfoot, with a terrific creature design by rick baker."
negative;positive;it isn't pretty.
negative;positive;every critic panned chris farley and david spade's movies.
negative;negative;clue: if you think the former, you've picked up the wrong movie from blockbuster.
negative;negative;in fact, the narration wa the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious i have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over-the-top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it.
negative;positive;everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what's more likely more then one person.lastly, the music used is just great(a lot of cars, u2,lots of obscure(now) song from the 80's.-an 80's purist's dream.
negative;negative;i would have given this le than a 1 rating if it were possible.
negative;positive;only recently (e.g., insomnia) have the original work begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.
negative;negative;this ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the uk in that, anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given.
negative;negative;the cg effect on the dragon were terrible, even for the sci-fi channel and the writing wa pathetic.
negative;negative;what happened to white go-go boots?
positive;positive;for storyteller adicts, it feature the man himself introducing the myths, the lion from 'true bride,' and... no annoying opening theme!
negative;positive;of course, it's the guy that like to collect eyeballs, and he's got quite a collection going.
negative;positive;i can go on, but i won't gush too much more.this film should have received oscar nominations, certainly one for best picture.
negative;negative;rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone else the favor.
negative;positive;"it's clear enough early in the film that punishment park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the ""unpatriotic"" element of american society."
negative;positive;a with any tv series, there are episode that shine and those that don't.
negative;positive;the whole time you are watching it you are thinking wtf?
negative;positive;the imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over.
negative;negative;to begin, i still cannot shake the ferris beuller rip-off.
negative;negative;terrible!
negative;negative;oh yes, i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash.
positive;positive;with her beauty, she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history.
positive;positive;benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent jarda from going off to jail.in the circumstance marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, zdena (jana brejchova) and the far le tender mercy of zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka (jiri schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, prof to be the uncle from hell.
positive;negative;jjaks wake up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her.
negative;negative;this is one of the hardest to watch film ever, there are scene with silence that seems to last hour before somebody come out with the next badly written, badly acted line.
negative;negative;i didn't want it to suck.
negative;positive;"not equally ingenious a ""pulp fiction"" but thing seem much more natural in ""the apartment""."
negative;negative;i found out it wa flex like hour after watching the movie.
negative;positive;danglard, on the other hand, go from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of fame, hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment.
positive;positive;most of the one by christopher guest such as: best in show, for your consideration, a mighty wind, and waiting for guffman
positive;positive;this lead to the bitter, grumbling old woman to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten child and inconsiderate friend the moneylender.
negative;negative;a bit unbelievable when the pow use camp made re-breathers to swim between the pow camp and the filipino village, every night.
negative;positive;had it not been for to kill a mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous.
positive;positive;a great film for fan of true to life problem befalling believable families.
negative;positive;his cell phone received a call from a known terrorist.
positive;positive;well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected.
negative;negative;just didn't have any meaning to it i could see.
positive;positive;surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.
negative;negative;it deserved only 3 out of 10!
negative;negative;there were only a few scene that make you laugh but nothing more.
negative;negative;or what if black made a movie glorifying the nat turner rebellion?
positive;negative;it's about different strategy of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society.
negative;positive;it wa unforgettable.
negative;positive;his conversation with sadhu are real jewel of dialogue writing.
positive;negative;like linnea quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint, 30 year-old actor playing teenagers, and of course... rollerdisco!
negative;positive;i suppose it's a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically.
negative;negative;"anyhow, if you are out of option when it come to finding new ""horror"" film that you haven't seen 1,000 time already, (as i was) and you are debating this one, i would still skip this."
negative;negative;"there's also the painfully comic maecenas, whom we see a a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he wa such (he's once referred to a ""being effeminate in his pleasures"" in the annals).the interior are rather meager and rely on clich√©s upon clich√©s."
negative;negative;there is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters, and so suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no allure at all.the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, i wa quite surprised.
positive;negative;a jewish girl's family is butchered, she go into hiding, later encounter the man responsible for her pain and then hatch a great plan for revenge.
negative;positive;she rescue him and take him back to the school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence so that he will be taken to prison, the headmistress, miss martha (geraldine page), her assistant edwina (elizabeth hartman), their black servant hallie (mae mercer), and the mostly teenage girl take him in, heal him, and fall under his spell.
positive;negative;a policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping luther, even though at one point he ha a rifle squarely aimed at luther while luther cluck and doe his rendition of the polish chicken dance.
negative;negative;so he try to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketch are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl, not funny, just painful.
positive;negative;sound very good.
negative;negative;he and buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all.
negative;negative;"rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits."
positive;positive;finally i discovered what i thought i remembered a a four year old.
positive;positive;"some little touch that make this film undeniably hitchcockian- the use of non-english dialog, especially french (something hitch did on a much larger scale in ""to catch a thief""); the use of foreboding, arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; stewart and day talking to each other in the church, singing their word to the tune of the hymn; the albert hall scene, specifically showing the musician and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, a well a the percussionist getting the cymbal ready; and finally the assassin's gun a it appears from behind the curtain."
negative;negative;if it's not one of the stooges, it's somebody.i wa astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who know all about junk like this.
positive;positive;an absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different story from four different location in sweden.
positive;negative;"you see, three year ago all of you critic said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known a ""how the grinch stole christmas""."
negative;negative;yes, blinks!
positive;positive;lau ching wan and his friend (dayo wong chi wa, anthony wong chau sun, francis ng chun yu, jordan chan siu chun, cheung man tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship show in their performances.
negative;negative;"in short, it is clearly one of the worst sci-fi movie of the 80's and i would be so bold a to say ""of all time""."
negative;negative;this is by far the most pathetic movie indian cinema or any cinema ha come up with.it is totally a piece of crap.the story line ode not hold any water.
negative;negative;no madder how much time is spent in mind over matter, benefit of a doubt, walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this, there is no positive thinking when it come to down right bad film making.the sequel star kevin zegers a josh, who is in eight grade.
positive;positive;vasili merkuryev, a the patriarch fyodor ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance.
negative;negative;this movie is so predictable, the actual word need additional letter to exemplify the predictability.
positive;negative;regardless of the nice car in the film, or the truth in christ's sacrifice for you, a a movie and witnessing tool, lay it down hardly delivers.
negative;positive;"i thought it wa something along the line of ""my great escape"", but i've searched on the internet, books, pretty much everything i could think of to try to, and i just can't find it anywhere."
negative;negative;this film come on.
negative;positive;yeah he went to that convention in son of the desert that ruined her plans, but he wanted to get some private time - there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives.
positive;positive;when he come back from the foreign legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed.
negative;negative;"to ""i just killed 12 people and boy, are my arm tired."""
negative;positive;half storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit.
negative;negative;it wa a relief to know it wa not real after reading the comments.
negative;negative;what's going on here?
positive;positive;and for a catharsis junkie like me, that's about the best censorial experience i could ask for.
negative;negative;but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie.
negative;negative;some of the film wa also shot in jamestown, ca, very near columbia.
positive;positive;the music is great.
negative;negative;two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage.
positive;negative;"the film wa ninth of twenty-two feature produced by haworth, each of which wa tailored to hayakawa's talent and to his stock company of japanese actors."""
negative;positive;"unless you have something like ray bradbury's ""the sound of thunder."""
positive;positive;"eastwood is excellent in the film, and it is interesting to see him in an early role, or any role, where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic.geraldine page had a plum role in the film a the headmistress, and i cannot imagine another actress of the time being a good in the role; a long shot could have been piper laurie, but i don't think laurie could have embodied the role in the same manner a geraldine page.elizabeth hartman (whose wonderful performance in the film ""a patch of blue"" a a blind girl who fall in love with sidney poiter's character is another high point in her short career) is at her prime here, delicate and masterful at the same time."
negative;positive;i didn't like the idea on how they thought chris hansen would do a show on tourette and let a boy speak out and bash the jews.one thing i did not like is how south park thought that people with tourette syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that.

positive;positive;certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but strayer make an effective albeit restrained work in this film.as written above, the screenplay is filled with great line that make the quirky character shine, and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage.

negative;positive;had it not been for william faulkner, perhaps to kill a mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow.i found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, to kill a mockingbird, may not have been a original a i'd always thought it was.
negative;positive;david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly.
negative;negative;all one need to know about him is revealed in the film first ten minute and from that point on, whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster (and he rarely does), he's not worth watching.
negative;negative;i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies, but unfortunately for the one who made this one it doe just that.

positive;negative;"both ""legend of boggy creek"" (1972) and the first film entitled ""sasquatch"" (1978) have become minor cult classics, but neither were very memorable."
negative;negative;i bet the director wa either mega-stoned when he made this or he wa just taking the pee out of every david bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap.
negative;negative;any positive other than david hood the third... yes the aerial shot of london largely submerged were very well done and the effect artist responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story,if you'll forgive the expression, a those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage.
negative;negative;my opinion may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but, this is the kind of film that only go to undermine the commercial viability and quality standard which have only just kept a british film industry in existence.

positive;positive;i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless.to summarise, mr. bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family.

positive;negative;when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash.
negative;negative;the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film wa the question could mike myers have played a normal, dramatic character.
positive;positive;and all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheaval of that era, although many are just touched upon... a part of the tapestry.

positive;negative;the film is unusual, but in it attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating).

positive;positive;the antagonistic figure of bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by robert walker, sadly in his last film role, but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what make stranger on a train so memorable, a the character is a marvel to behold.
negative;positive;when the cat wake up, they start on a long trek home.
negative;positive;and not enough can be said about peter o' toole, petula clarke, michael redgrave and michael bryant's acting.
positive;negative;in a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting, herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wish to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco.
positive;positive;there's one thing though, it's got to be one of the most jarringly, and intense thriller i've seen in quite a while.

positive;negative;i have already mentioned lynda bellingham in the role of 'fussy mother' (yes, thats a far a character development and back-story goes), but i wa impressed by the actor maurice roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast, having appeared in everything from classic movie such a richard attenborough's 'oh what a lovely war', and 'the eagle ha landed', and tv including baywatch, holby city, the bill, eastenders, cheers, doctor who in the 80s, star trek, and even going to hollywood with sylvestor stallone in 1995s judge dredd) whose performance reminded me very much of actual teacher i have met - often incapable men, whose life are tinged with a very sad streak.
negative;positive;sure the ending wa expected, but i feel better cheering for cop than a bunch of young gang members.
negative;positive;it give you almost no spoilers, but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me. there is no spoon.
negative;negative;everything in this production is amateurish.always a joy to watch, mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation.
positive;negative;"minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many misstep of this ""civil-war love story""."

negative;negative;please, stop jason horton and shannon hubbel.
negative;negative;and yes, i'm sure there will be response to this about how his conscious got to him, but come on.the main character crawled out the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him.
negative;negative;he didn't, really.
positive;positive;it's the best proof that the series, ingoing it 4th season, is still alive and kicking hard.although the producer don't amaze u with some more flash-forward this time, the return to flashback is more than satisfying, a it brings some shocking facts.
positive;positive;"lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his ""love story in the city of dreams"" a a set of interconnected abstraction and motifs.the acting is top rate, especially naomi watt a diane selwyn/betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance."

negative;negative;this movie basically try to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just come off a boring a any other job except you save life or property by extinguishing the fire.
negative;negative;surely at the very least solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it wa at any given time?
negative;positive;oh sure, it follows the storyline of now having popeye in the u.s. navy.
positive;positive;duchess is a pretty white cat who life with her three kitten in her wealthy owner's mansion in paris.
negative;negative;dialogue in this flick just killed me.
negative;positive;this movie ha made a huge impact on me and i plan on buying a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library.
negative;negative;i give it a 2 for using london a a location, which is a nice change, for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shot that were decent (those of the water closing in on london and the gates).do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one.

positive;negative;you could take numerous piece of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhardt did decent job in undemanding role and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably.
negative;positive;everything in front of the camera is anything but simple.
positive;negative;kevin zegers and cynthia stevenson were absolutely pathetic.there were a few hilarious moment near the end by a couple of football announcers, but that isn't even worth mentioning.

negative;negative;at first i thought perhaps that when treeline film wa doing the dvd transfer, they might have reversed two of the reels.
negative;negative;without a doubt, this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) cgi.
positive;positive;a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems.
negative;positive;to say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it...if you are into creepy, gothic tales, find it and rent it.
positive;negative;"by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'herbie ride again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast's frantic mugging."

negative;negative;probably the worst film i've ever seen.
negative;negative;all these different scene hang together by a lame wraparound story starring donald pleasance and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater.
negative;positive;behind that pas there is the whole 'pache nation.
positive;positive;"the taut filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people most remember about the film of course, and indeed it's pretty remarkable; but i liked the half-completed location of the final shootout, once the robbery ha gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portrayal gritty side of paris in stark black and white; and servais' channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performance.perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classic that really doe live up to it reputation just a pure entertainment even if what it ha to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought-provoking; george auric's at turn modernist, romantic, and jazzy score is another highlight."
positive;positive;i cannot recall any other tv series (babylon 5, buffy, angel, etc) that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking (at times) and suspenseful ride.i think that at the end of the fourth season, thing were finally becoming tightly focused and i am shocked at the decision to cancel the series.
positive;positive;stranger on a train, one of hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these trait - an entertaining and suspenseful story, even when viewed over 50 year later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stand today a a masterpiece in film technique.

negative;negative;raj and pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-reliant to be doing the dreamy-eyed, pouting, unrequited love bit, more appropriate to lovelorn school kid than the parent of four grown children.
negative;negative;i watched this knowing it would be bad, but usually watching a bad movie make me feel good because it give me something to make fun of.
positive;negative;a an homage to underdog, it is even worse.
negative;negative;this is a far cry from charlie chaplin, but it wa still nice to see him.
negative;negative;the dialog and plot are about a complex a that of a dr. sue book.
negative;negative;the rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the b-film quality that some of u cherish.i recently spent 2 year trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it is almost nonexistent.

negative;positive;the ending of both version leave room for interpretation.
negative;negative;i should have followed my instinct and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15-minute mark.to lynch's credit, she did manage to interject many thing that make a good film: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors.
negative;positive;"this movie take a handful of ticked-off young film maker and clearly and cleverly show the ""why"" of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the waldo film."
negative;positive;now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn't very good, especially at the beginning.

positive;negative;this is one entertaining flick.
negative;positive;on the other hand there were many scene that involved drug use and although important to understanding the character lifestyle, i think there wa some overkill in this department.
negative;negative;all the actor stay true to the script.

negative;negative;the entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor.
positive;positive;in many way the film resembles 2001 - a space odyssey, especially it opening sequence.
negative;negative;she represents everything that is wrong with american woman.
negative;negative;no.acting, corny and rubbish.sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actor looked you wouldn't know where it wa coming from.cinematography.
negative;positive;camilla belle did really well in this movie, and i think that the other actor and actress ruined the movie for her.
negative;positive;memories, tapes, and rerun on courttv just aren't the same a watching it come on every friday.
positive;negative;perhaps you could steal her from me, marry her, give her the baby and the picket-fenced home she yearns for.
positive;positive;what a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many story that claim to be - totally true .
negative;negative;)and where wa the mod in that squad?
positive;negative;"i have a theory that the backer for this movie also own the poker magazines, because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. """

negative;negative;exactly the sort of film the irish film industry shouldn't be making.
negative;positive;"gylenhall also is wasted a a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in, although he get to do the ""right thing"" in the end.i found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject."
positive;negative;a i write this user-comment, tim burton's interpretation of the sweeney todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of oscar nomination if i'm not mistaken.
negative;negative;i'll review this film version solely on it own merits, a i don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.the film's opening credit are printed in an old english typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting.
positive;positive;however, thanks to excellent production value and a juicy script, this one is a joy to watch.
negative;negative;both film were targeted at family friendly audiences, thus inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone.
positive;negative;in fact, the whole bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious that they make the von trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison.
negative;negative;the only one who can be interested in this film are those who lost their job and want to know why.
positive;positive;i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen.
positive;positive;in the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention.
positive;positive;in this respect the film pale in comparison to rising damp's brilliant series.
positive;negative;).some new stuff is doing well (the olaf character, sometimes, like with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern reference are exasperating (music, sm -not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: doe anyone know imagination?).
positive;positive;and i also liked hearing from otto frank.
negative;positive;furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount carmel center and when the building wa burning.
negative;negative;a some of the character are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty conscience it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the vision do all seem to look like sixth form art films.
negative;negative;to top it off, the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity.
negative;positive;it's not a children's movie.
positive;negative;"by the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which i won't reveal here.one of the other user commenting on this state ""this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart""."
positive;positive;"a new movie that's in the making, called ""dreamseller,"" is in production, which is about the story of novak's dreams, shattered by his addiction."
negative;negative;a soon a the movie starts, you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected, and you will be right.in the first half hour, it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u.f.o.
positive;positive;john cusack star a hoop in this silly little movie that ha to be one of the best of the eighty teen comedies.believe it or not demi moore is his co star...if you love the eighties,grew up around that time,or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh.wait until you see the cartoons..what a riot....
negative;negative;the violence is mild, there are a few ok fight scene but this is pretty weak stuff really.technically the film look alright & is competently made, it wa actually shot in mexico.
negative;negative;a guy in a rental recommended it.
negative;positive;slightly forced at times.kudos on dax shepard in this one.
positive;negative;"most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end, a speech in which raj (who ha somehow managed to turn his experience into an award-winning bestseller) lecture u all on the verity of parent/child relationship for ten straight minute at the very least.""baghban"" is a sappy, corny saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king-sized box of see's chocolates."
negative;negative;they aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes?
negative;positive;a for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane wa a lot better than i'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.
positive;negative;the performance are horrible by pretty much everybody.
negative;positive;but such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary.
negative;negative;the humour - which is pride & prejudice, both austen's methodology and her appeal - wa almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it wa allowed in, wa handled so clumsily.
negative;negative;but after the kind of funny introduction of characters, setting and potential conflicts, the story turned out kinda dull.
negative;negative;the jackass: sure, he look pretty, but he's the idiot in the movie that's inserted purely to be an idiot.
negative;negative;"i have never wished i could be watching a movie with dean cameron in it instead of what i wa watching in my life, but ""ski school"" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty.my grade: f eye candy: nikol nesbitt, buffy tyler and suzanne stokes all unleash their tupperware titswhere i saw it: starz on demand"
negative;positive;she, herself, wa pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot--and the novice director wa unsure, fairly green, and having great difficulty with all the decisions, logistics, etc.
negative;positive;based on the running time i assume that it wa the 1915 version that i saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minute longer, and from what i've read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes.
negative;positive;the question, however is: did han just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment, or did he make self-justice?
negative;positive;i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again, toughing it out just to look for the added scenes.
positive;positive;second, christopher doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelope it two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of it sumptuous, meticulously composed frame.
positive;positive;suspend belief and spend a couple of hour watching this, you will be glad you did.
negative;negative;"when the twist and turn finally revealed themselves, rather than saying ""ahh, i get it!"""
negative;negative;"somewhat fitting, given the actual fifteen minute content.i can do without any of the ""shemp a.d."" stuff, but i will admit to having a few lol moment from the two-man comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage (and kudos to those guy for trying to give it their all, considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs).another bright spot to this and the last a.d. debacle ""commotion on the ocean"" is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head."

negative;negative;thing that grange hill wa doing better when my parent were young!
positive;positive;there is a sublime scene reminiscent of a canterbury tale, when jewellery left a a trap by white bull in the tree is suddenly blown in the wind: there is a haunting, tingling, magical, thrilling effect more reminiscent of the arabian night than a horse opera.
negative;negative;when luther steal the boyfriend motorbike the movie take a turn for the worse.
negative;negative;this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen.
negative;negative;he even made the awful vega vacation at least worth a look.i will say that he try hard in this made for tv sequel, but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really get anywhere.

negative;negative;i don't recommend anybody to watch this.
positive;positive;this is one of the best film i've seen in the last years.belmonndo and deneuve shine in their respective roles, he a a naive plantation owner and she a an enigmatic trickster.words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed a a film noir.

positive;positive;our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph, to vanquish, to change his world (for the better) back into a world of plenty that no longer exists.we look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans-as-animals.
positive;negative;she wa quite beguiling in appearance here, but i still didn't buy her a a spy.i couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversation with those in my room (which i usually never do - i'm always shushing everybody).

negative;negative;wa he still using hooked-on-phonics and just got his letter mixed up to make these horrible sentences?, or wa he trying to get the director killed by the few people who saw this?
negative;negative;i like jeff daniels, but he should stick to acting and forget writing.

negative;positive;we all need to understand way of dealing with the past.
negative;negative;poor lady.
positive;positive;used well towards the end to follow veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier on a she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved one while she search for boris, her own farewell needing to be said.
positive;positive;wide truck and big red wheel (precision bearings, don't ya know).
positive;negative;however, this short little story is done with style(!
positive;positive;but andaaz apna apna is pretty different from the movie i have said above.
positive;negative;and even if this weren't true, that's not my point.
positive;positive;and yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable.
positive;negative;"now imagine that the image in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scene ¬ñ a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano."
positive;positive;one of my favorite scene is the pub scene.
negative;negative;the story is an endless chain of killing where nearly every character ha only the purpose to deliver more carcasses.
negative;negative;despite a totally awful premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shot of obvious double fighting it out in this grudge match.
negative;positive;in the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.
positive;positive;this film is a must see!!
negative;negative;), but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off.
negative;positive;he is mostly inspired by the great m.davis and t.monk.
positive;negative;maybe i'm wrong and that's what quality family humor ha been reduced to.
positive;positive;powerful performance by vario, (uncle benny), sara, (jessica tsunis), and morris, (eddie monroe).
positive;positive;you're a sap mr. jap and others like spinach fer britain aren't cartoon vehicle for comic relief in the theatre's program at all in the true sense.
positive;negative;sadly, her discovery lead her to pay the ultimate price in their revelation.
positive;positive;see it if you haven¬¥t.
negative;positive;i found only one problem with it.
positive;positive;liv ullman and max von sydow give painfully detailed performance in this spare, stark drama.
positive;positive;it's a horror story alright.
positive;positive;co-starring in his first american film is conrad veidt with his 'cadaverous spider' interpretation of 'louis xi'.
negative;positive;their diction is le than perfect ... stilted and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent.
negative;negative;"""bambi"" wa the first (and until today the only) movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars."
negative;negative;the only thing worthwhile is colin firth, and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout.for diehard firth fan only -- the shower scene alone is worth the $3.99 you might have to shell out, should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did.i'm happy for mr. firth that his day of taking project like this one are over!
negative;positive;their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keep this film from becoming too fragmented.suzy parker, the off-the-chart gorgeous ex-fashion model, appears a gregg adams, an aspiring stage actress, a role that, according to any biography i've ever read about her, wa apparently not much of a stretch.
positive;positive;the fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable kishore kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect.
positive;positive;the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he ha a tough side.
negative;positive;laraine day is a favorite actress of mine, someone mgm loaned out constantly because they didn't know what to do with her.
negative;positive;sure, i pretended to be spiderman, batman and other superheros, but i really wanted to be johnny sakko over any of them.
negative;negative;when the movie had ended there wa hardly anything that wa gained from any of the interactions, save a tiny few scene or image that rose above the one note film.
negative;positive;it sound like a recipe for disaster.
positive;positive;complete entertainment!
negative;negative;this would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie.
negative;positive;even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for vito since he only want the money he get from the ripped offed mobster to pay his sick wife's rose's hospital and medical bills.
positive;negative;and to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement k rails.
negative;negative;amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly ha a significant part to play (i won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series).
positive;positive;i love this dated sf if only for gerry's wonderful model cars, planes, building and spaceships.
negative;negative;if you rented it on a dvd and would want to watch the movie, despite the reviews, then play it on maximum speed your player would allow!
negative;negative;"after 92 minute of utter pain and another ripped off scene, this time from ""blair witch"", the movie finally stagger across the finish line and ends."
negative;negative;kennan ivory wayans wa so funny in low down dirty shame that i had to see this one and it wa one of the worst he ha done and steven seagal didn't help much.
negative;positive;"you like ""lost"", you have to watch it."
negative;positive;so...it wa borrowed from the civic center display...with permission, by the way!
negative;positive;thing are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else.
positive;positive;very realistic.
negative;positive;if you can find this move, don't miss it.
negative;positive;same movie, but different feel.
negative;negative;likewise, all of the male character seem to be ad-libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie.
negative;negative;the five crew member crash land on mar where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organism whose evolution wa isomorphic with ours, right down to their having five digit and willowy babe in short skirts.
positive;negative;on the other hand, redneck ha to be seen - you won't believe how bad it is otherwise!
negative;positive;i only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up.
negative;negative;the one good thing about this particular film wa that i wa never bored.
negative;positive;he meet warlike miniatures, socialist giants, head-in-the-clouds (literally) philosophers, and pacifist horse who rule over yahoo -- nearly neanderthal humanoids.
negative;positive;by the end it's too late.
negative;negative;that's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several project were thrown together somehow, barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work.
positive;positive;no doubt she wa a very engaging writer, and she did posse an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words.
positive;positive;however it is light entertainment, the story have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moment of acting.
positive;positive;you really feel that these could be your own parent if circumstance were different and indeed make one question the life of one own parents.
negative;negative;this is, at best, only half a movie- and not the good half.
positive;positive;likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it, and the turtle's partner barely look human with his big flippers.animal story and nature documentary always anthropomorphize, but fata morgana ha none of that.
positive;positive;this morning wa the first time i'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and i still think it's one of the greatest film made in the last decade.
negative;negative;but modern viewer (in britain, at least) can no longer take this sort of material seriously.
negative;negative;where have i come across that well-worn theme before?
positive;positive;a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world.
negative;negative;hardly likely.
positive;negative;the worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and mr. darcy (sans cravat and vest) at which they admit their love for each other.
negative;negative;he can be very funny when his energy are applied where they belong, comic sketches.
positive;positive;one of the two best film of the year.
negative;negative;i can only think of one reason this movie wa released.
positive;positive;the first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequence that have your heart in your throat and cloud u with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation.
negative;positive;the same is true here - if it had been james having the affair and doing the subsequent activities, viewer might feel differently about the story.
positive;positive;acting: samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role.
negative;negative;"""pola x"" doe not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work."
negative;positive;nobody want to fight joe, but joe feel he must defend himself.
negative;positive;though i can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer-x looked like, in the manga, they did.
positive;positive;a good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.7.4/10
negative;negative;and it doesn't make sense.
negative;negative;at least it wa a decade ago.
negative;negative;"the best part about ""party camp"" is the fact that it literally ha no plot."
positive;positive;these are the people who are singled out.
negative;negative;i guess we're supposed to sympathize a he stumble through a series of misadventure seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature.
negative;negative;any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense!
negative;negative;no, it wasn't a flashback.
positive;positive;young johnson and carey, jr. come off real well, but this is bond's film to shine a he ha the best lines.
positive;positive;the zephyr team originated from the zephyr surf shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards.
negative;positive;thank you for telling this story!!
negative;negative;*spoiler ends*the film suffers from many things, first the weak acting drag it down immensely!
positive;positive;the real-world accident at tmi prof the film's basic premise.
negative;negative;"rounding out the cast is linda watkins(""the parent trap"") a the obnoxious mrs. kilgore, the obvious comic relief spurting out an obvious fake ""cockney"" accent."
negative;negative;this is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the danger of pre-marital sex.
negative;negative;no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of door in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour.
negative;negative;"the latter have a lot of spot where you win even money, and fewer for higher amounts, until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks.but i picture the channel's wheel having about six different genre on it wheel, with two of them, appearing the most, labeled ""the psychotic neighbor,"" or ""the spouse with a hidden past or secret or both."""
negative;positive;andersson give u something else here.
negative;negative;this may just be the worst movie ever produced.
negative;positive;this movie must be exported to the rest of the world!
positive;positive;the three woman max ha met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations.
positive;positive;a very recommended film if you like the genre.
positive;positive;everyone ha their own personality and lorelai gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comment that can make any bad situation seem a little funny.
positive;positive;the show is also very funny.
positive;positive;dr. paul flanner (richard gere), a successful surgeon, ha his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited james franco) not respect him and loos a patient he's operating on.
positive;positive;calls.
negative;positive;i came away from bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing wa going to happen and get taken for a ride in true park fashion.
negative;negative;but most of all i'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out.rating: * out of ****
negative;negative;i guess that's why it come on a 20-pack dvd war movie collection for five bucks.the 70 music did not belong in this movie or any wwii movie.
negative;negative;cameron mitchell a the reporter, yet to hit his stride a a male lead, which, come to think of it, he never really did.
negative;negative;the simple, primal premise can lead to several great stories.
positive;positive;anwar el-ibrahimi is an egyptian man who ha been living for twenty year in the united states.
positive;positive;i recently rented her first movie, leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl.
negative;negative;some of the worse line i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actor one after the other.you've seen this story a thousand times.
positive;positive;andrew berzins is an excellent writer, and his talent and expertise in this field came shining through in this film.
negative;negative;shady writing, wooden performances, and sappy direction all point that this pulpy fertilizer ha far mooore bark than bite.
positive;negative;the story kind of follows rosemary's baby around and stuff, but in reality it is kind of a mess, it doe not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shine through very well.
positive;negative;but the memory of mankind survive in a capsule.
negative;positive;somebody get pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard that phrase?
negative;positive;and rod cameron wa the only survivor.
positive;positive;max and dave even put popeye in service aboard the mythical battleship, the u.s.s.
negative;negative;"at this point of the movie you could have seen the ""monster"" picking his nose and it would be considered a ""twist""."
positive;positive;is there a planet on the far side of the sun?
positive;positive;a still powerful story that predates the sidney poitier film of racial prejudice.
positive;positive;it's often said that the best film about america are made by foreigners, who can approach the familiar with an outsider's eye.
negative;positive;alexander knox play the male lead, but the real lead of the film is irene dunne--who look amazing for a 47 year-old lady (yes, i checked--she really wa this old when she made the film).
positive;positive;another scene, eerily reminiscent of jack torrance (jack nicholson) in stanley kubrick's 'the shining,' involves holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.genuinely ominous and unsettling in it execution, victor sj√∂str√∂m's 'k√∂rkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.
negative;negative;so obviously i wasn't gonna pay to see it, but once it hit dvd, i thought sure, i'll watch it for free.
negative;negative;you know that kid who teased you in high school...he's no terrorist, he's probably an accountant.)
positive;positive;"the last reel of the film will still surprise audiences, a it refuse to sink into expected clich√©s, including those that tainted ""waterfront."""
negative;positive;however, when a hoard of blood-thirsty zombie emerge from the local graveyard {their entrance ghoulishly narrated by vincent price}, the situation begin to get interesting.it's difficult to quite put my finger on why 'thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all music videos.
negative;negative;this, perhaps inadvertently, play well with the character who are, at first appearance very shallow but a the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.technically the film ha a lot of problem however.
negative;negative;only the few lead have stamina.
negative;negative;it seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster ha assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy.
positive;negative;if i wanted to watch 60's crime drama, i'd buy dvds.
negative;negative;in game two, kasparov played a game that wa designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess program would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss.
positive;negative;i love umberto lenzi's cop movie -- rome armed to the teeth is my favorite -- and his desert commando pretty much legitimized the italian euro war phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie.
positive;positive;how will all this work out and will ronald wise up and act like a responsible adult--these are the main theme of this pleasant little film.this isn't a great movie and certainly won't change your life, but it certainly is very entertaining and fun.
positive;positive;a homemade production in the best sense, the out-of-sync dubbing and sound recording, and the granular cinematography and up-close camera setups, build an immersive atmosphere that perfectly suit cassavetes' nuanced vision of human relationship a perpetual work in progress, marked by desperate emotional fluctuation and wistful attempt at communication and understanding.
negative;negative;let me stress that this wa totally unexpected, and had nothing to do with the movie... unless it's a cynical reference to love a it's portrayed in the film: a blind, selfish, predatory survival mechanism that tear apart the helpless... but then again, i'm probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head...
positive;negative;although the love between them wa shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that othello had between ca and desi a well a it should.
negative;negative;he wa able to get back in the armored car, and no one saw him...
positive;positive;he is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter.
negative;positive;and, eighteen blew my sock off yet again, even more so.
positive;positive;joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he is need is a pretext to lash out, which is what the story is about.
negative;negative;do we really care?
negative;negative;this is a big disappointment.
negative;negative;it's a little bit on the stupid side a far a the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eye real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable.
negative;positive;certainly when i saw this movie at hbo, i wa bit erratic in following the plot, but it catch my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it.
negative;negative;"i found myself futilely coaching my television: ""make sure he's dead!"
negative;positive;she ha shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting!
negative;negative;"""sean"" is played by d.j."
positive;negative;is it?
negative;positive;it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it make u feel better, a though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a u citizen get just by being a u citizen.
positive;negative;lori nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world.
negative;positive;coppola toy with reality, turning the jagged memory of his character into scrapbook we've been made privy to.
negative;negative;it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising.
positive;positive;korean are very traditional people, they see love very quitely.
negative;negative;i'll have to check back on this site.
negative;negative;4 / 10.
negative;negative;and then they tell me this movie had $80 million dollar budget.
negative;positive;a psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit.
negative;negative;there just didn't seem to be any direction.
positive;positive;i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival.this is the first indian film i've seen in the tamil language, and while it doe share some similarity with other indian film (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempt more than just to entertain.
negative;positive;the first scene in the stair is fantastic, but it isn't the only one, there is later a scene when veronika attempt committing suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scene in movie history, the bombing of veronika's house when she run the stair in the middle of fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed.
positive;negative;thats 2 for the gore and 2 for kane hodder.
positive;positive;even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics.
negative;negative;in the loft, a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark, bottom area of the barn house, then she get it.
negative;negative;granted, it present a decent and versatile (too versatile?)
negative;negative;i've seen far worse in my time.a new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world get saved yet once again, how about some where thing are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best effort still end up in failure.
negative;negative;guessing the password for an email account) and yawning uncontrollably (thought i must have misread the 1hr 50min running time a it seemed to drag on for 3 hour 50 minutes).
negative;negative;everything else wa in a logical order.
negative;negative;but this movie just destroyed that.
negative;positive;due to a very misleading advertising campaign, i saw this film in theatre at the relatively young age of 10.
positive;positive;and also the fact that the scene where she see her dead parents, laying there in each others arms, and her brother, all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully, even if being poisoned, fit with a dream sequence.
negative;negative;eric stolz & delpy were the only two showing some charisma.
negative;negative;"the scientist include dr. william arnold (tod andrews, ""hang 'em high"", ""beneath the planet of the apes"") and professor clark(john mcnamara,""war of the colossal beast"")."
negative;positive;what a shame.key west, northern exposure, gilmore girls, and veronica mars... all great shows, all sadly gone before their time.hear us, loud and clear, we want key west on dvd..... please.
negative;negative;not that the writer helped him out any.
negative;positive;despite some cringe moments, this aspect didn't hinder my enjoyment of it.
negative;negative;this flick is a waste of time.i expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosion and some shooting.van damme's acting is awful.
negative;negative;if you're into hearing the same joke you heard 3-4 year ago in big budget movie form, chuck your money here.
negative;positive;really, they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation, by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke english and so we are caught up in the confusion too.
negative;negative;this go on for about 45 minutes.then in a five-minute montage, she sneak into an enemy base, strap herself to a rocket, try to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies.none of this ha any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.in the last twenty minutes, basically the chick's memory get transferred to her daughter, who go into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secret of mankind.
negative;negative;i'll miss bankotsu... poor, poor psycho little boy.cons: outside of shichinintai arc, the series wa overall boring, repetitive and some of the character are extremely irritating.
negative;negative;what the hell.small thing were noticed too: ulf's red hair which he get from astrid ha been changed to brown in the movie, and vivian work at a chocolate shop.
negative;negative;the only thing that it's missing so far is the jesus is god message.
negative;negative;it will not make sense.the second act involves a woman walking in the desert.
positive;negative;subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic face and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia!
negative;negative;"add ""de-lish"" to my list of stupid tag words."
negative;negative;well -- and why not?
negative;positive;most of the teen are deservingly killable too so that work well.
negative;negative;too many parallels.
positive;positive;his heart just wasn't in the performance.
negative;negative;for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end.
negative;negative;the acting wa not that bad.
positive;negative;"monogram studio lived on a kind of cost plus basis; cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while."
negative;negative;the script is terrible.
negative;negative;i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie.
negative;negative;would you sit in a game where the player push their chip into the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet?
positive;positive;awesome!
positive;negative;translated to vortex, uzumaki is about just that- an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange downward spiral into nothingness that ha seemingly captivated a whole small town into dementia obsessed lunatics.
negative;positive;you can pretty much figure out the rest.this is what's known a a weepie or a woman's film.
negative;positive;the former seems to have the upper hand.
negative;positive;if you want to know who is am√°lia rodrigues.
negative;negative;he can't.
negative;negative;3) kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostril just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago.
positive;positive;the heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and katherine see her sister bury her shoe - plus, something in helen's manner make her realize that helen isn't telling the truth.
positive;positive;a hollywood film of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clich√©e after clich√©e, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually come across a smart and original.
positive;positive;samuel l. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, a well a play lot of blue guitar, which he look cool doing.
negative;positive;it gave me a whole new insight, not just into the zephyr team, but into skateboarding a a whole.
positive;positive;this film is very good and i'd reecommend it to anyone.
negative;negative;sloppy editing and careless direction also add to the confusion a half the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film wa constantly used up with these long, slow fade out (which made no sense or served any purpose).
positive;positive;the movie wa cheesy in the best possible way.
negative;positive;he wa accused of being a child molester and wa credited for the breakdown and death of his followers.
positive;negative;on the right are movie that are not a commercial, but are focused more on cinema a art than cinema a product.i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie go too far to either end, it's rarely good.
negative;positive;film like this made today just don't have the same style.
positive;negative;"somehow, sam's soul ""emerges"" with the inanimate scarecrow who come from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot."
negative;negative;"i think my grand total wa 107; can you beat that?"
negative;negative;there wa even an actual bull but it wa like it wa another type of animal completely!
positive;positive;at first i couldn't tell if it wa an art film or a documentary.
negative;positive;it made me laugh!!
negative;negative;all right, let's be realistic about this.
negative;negative;they're just not particularly likable.
positive;negative;first she ride a taxi with a ghost (ghosts ride taxis?)
negative;negative;this film is one of the worst adaptation of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film.
negative;positive;9/10
negative;negative;for the prosecution, kevin spacey go through the motion of being demon spawn, while in the town at large, cross are burned, witness are intimidated and the local citizen don't seem to care some of the review here claim the film immoral, since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the force of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart-tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey.
negative;negative;they didn't miss a darn thing.
positive;negative;you kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going, what?
positive;positive;some may shun coppola's unapologetic twisting of event in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate it shortcomings.
positive;negative;a rootless music producer) and upen patel (who play reggi, an upcoming artist who cross a.j.
positive;positive;arcand ha the gift of exploring frivolous thing in a bleak, gray kind of way, then turning round and exploring the horror of life with a lighthearted touch.the cast is, without exception, above average.
negative;negative;the movie act like we're already supposed to know about half the characters.and steve guttenberg try to do manic, a-la-robin williams comedy in this movie.
negative;positive;this wa one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for u to purchase.
negative;positive;9/10.
negative;negative;i don't know.. it wa like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once tasted great.
negative;negative;"my brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it wa good and he generally ha great taste in movies; from the moment he told me the title i looked at him like he wa crazy."
positive;negative;i wish that the production company could give back my money.
negative;negative;alas, 45 minute in, i realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library, doing nothing.
negative;positive;rising damp would, at first, appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment a this hilarious series wa based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit.
negative;positive;vijay who had come to play a kabaddi match there see this and decides to help her.
negative;negative;i'm afraid it isn't.
negative;negative;a an example, a whole 20 minutes, of the 80 minute film, is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator.this wa supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001.
positive;negative;"the ""cool cars"" and ""good message"" don't do jack to make this movie good."
negative;negative;zero passion.even the final scene where she dance for orville redenbacher and some other stiff is unsatisfying because the panel reaction is so unbelievable.
negative;positive;seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tear suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness.
negative;negative;"on the title screen it say ""100 passengers... 3,000 venemous vipers!"""
negative;positive;vijay raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his character to succeed, in whatever he does.
positive;positive;the one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career.
negative;negative;the 70s?
positive;negative;independence day scene where you snuff out some memorable landmark in a fireball.
positive;negative;there are also two other actors, monte markham (plays sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and peter mark richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performance that are okay.
positive;positive;you couldn't look better sha-shawn
negative;positive;i miss rickman's sexy english accent (luckily he slip into it and out of the american pattern).
negative;positive;it's a well-crafted show in that regard.
negative;positive;i could offer my explanation on each scene but that would be totally pointless.
negative;negative;the actor playing jpii wa very rigid, there wa no personality there.
positive;negative;this film ha a huge mumber of scenes.
negative;positive;he's too old to really do much action in film so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes.
negative;negative;like herzog, he chooses not a story but submits a report ¬ñ and a left-wing political propaganda report at that!
negative;positive;that's because it paired john and lionel barrymore in the film and since these brother were such dynamic actors, i think i expected spark and magic but instead only caught glimpse of it here and there.
negative;positive;i never thought i'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning kenji miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrence in his life--by the end, i'm not sure if he dy (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dy (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--miyazawa wrote a children's book called night on the galactic railroad).
positive;negative;his brigham city wa quite good.
negative;negative;"asks newbie pilot robert downey, jr., ""when you guy act like this doe it mean there's something to celebrate?"""
negative;negative;is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?
positive;positive;directed by jesse cowell and animated by erica langworthy, starring the beautiful marissa parness, with music by nico audy-rowland, daniel collins, jeff strathearn, matt sisco, and selcuk bor.
positive;positive;despite the shortcomings, eighteen is a worthwhile film and deserves attention.
negative;negative;the direction wa trying to be way too creative with what it wa working with, and the flashback sequence were used merely a a shock effect.after watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and review the film and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving.
negative;negative;just laugh at it.
positive;negative;anyone who think kool moe dee, carol alt, and corey feldman comprise a list of good actor must be smoking something i'd love to try sometime.
negative;negative;i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original mod squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, on the big screen.
positive;positive;on the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestone of the local cemetery, holm (victor sj√∂str√∂m, who also directed) and two of his drunken associate merrily await the coming of the new year.
positive;positive;"this enables the 24 year old bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the 37 year old preston; yep, she could be a colonel's wife."
negative;negative;i've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film.
negative;negative;i found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it wa kept my interest, but the other 11 odd short really didn't pique my interest or make me think of anything at all.
positive;positive;of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which make this transformation so natural and remarkable.
negative;negative;well.....i don't buy it mr.
negative;negative;mystery.boy, wa i wrong!
negative;negative;the hero is lee shao hwa who i have never heard of before or any of the other actors.
positive;negative;the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore, and this is not seen once in surveillance.
negative;positive;it really wasn't.
positive;negative;and have the black woman be from huggy bear's stable of lady and the white woman be a watered down patty hearst and you've got black mama, white mama.in those waning day of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit.
negative;negative;this wa pathetic.
positive;positive;then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.the main failing here is in the performance people give.
negative;negative;which more than likely mean he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie.
positive;negative;"i told her i practice myself a lot..."" now this is a movie!also, according to similar movie ""executive decision"" where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance, 747's have massive attic up top."
negative;positive;there are so many funny scene that it's hard to pick a favorite.
negative;negative;there's a confusing bit at the end(well, more confusing than usual, anyway) in which the creature try to explain why it is doing this, but it make no sense whatsoever.
negative;positive;"if you want something ""different"", look no further."
negative;negative;the jap want the diver to raise the silver thrown out by the american before corrigador fell.
negative;negative;piranha, piranha certainly qualifies for that former badge, and is pretty damn close to the second.
positive;positive;however, preston perfectly capture the sense of honor someone must have seen in marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank.
positive;positive;deaf to the muttering and going on of an world outside the window.
negative;positive;- that wa only a matter of interest to page.
positive;negative;sure, the effect are laughable, the story confused, but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider day is always fun.
negative;negative;but no, vh1 is cheap.
positive;positive;and, in the very small universe of great gay or gay-subtext film, there is brokeback mountain, eighteen, mulholland drive, and maurice.thank you mr. bell!
positive;negative;go see a real japanese film.
positive;positive;indeed, it is always tough to make a movie from a comic and the first episode of the adventure of the french two greatest hero wa good but not fantastic.
positive;positive;this movie stand atop the horde a a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great chris farley.
negative;positive;aaron: no one invite a bad looking idiot to their room!the performance of holly hunter, albert brooks, and william hurt were absolutely brilliant!
negative;positive;"like the first film in this series (slaughter, 1972), i think it would be a mistake to just label this a ""blaxsploitation film""."
positive;positive;samojlova doe a magnificent job, and her character transformation will break your heart.
positive;positive;even a grandmother and school teacher (me) can appreciate artist who are able to turn their idea into reality (well, reality, film-wise).
positive;positive;then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gap of the story that you were curious about.the editing is the real star of the film.
positive;negative;the maker of the dolph lundgren action flick agent red (2000) edited footage from solo into that film.
positive;negative;but a good story don't have to be expensive.
negative;positive;i don't think a better portrayal could have been done.
negative;negative;we then get a cheap scare, followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend.
positive;negative;i look forward to the show's, and the network's, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.
negative;negative;i wa not disappointed in this undertaking, but had i been watching this one in a serious mood, i would have been irate.
negative;negative;but the rest wa real bad.
negative;negative;i watched this cooking show for a few time before i wanted to pull my hair out.
negative;negative;but in those day film reel contained approximately 11 minute of film, and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minute tops.
negative;positive;both movie re-use gag from the tv series, and the evidence show that the gag were done right the first time.
negative;positive;they delivered.
negative;negative;one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.
positive;positive;naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paint vivid portrait that make the character seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery.
negative;negative;every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor.
positive;positive;mute witness handle about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in russia.
negative;negative;that's right.
negative;negative;set the story on some caribbean island where the drug dealer rule and the revolution ha arrived.
negative;positive;when you see this part you will think it's a gag.
negative;negative;it come across a nothing more than a bos with the hots for one of his workers.
negative;positive;on one new year's eve several year ago, george ha broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing death's bidding and collecting the soul of the deceased.
positive;positive;one of the true great actor of our time, and one of the true great comedy's of all time.
positive;positive;"the second episode of the new ""lost"" give you just what it fan were lacking - a fair amount of riveting action."
negative;negative;but apart from that, it's just not very interesting.
negative;positive;"more ""quentin-ish"" than most film try to be."
positive;negative;the final girl: she ha just broken up for her boyfriend.
positive;positive;what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly, but then they focus in on it to make it strong.and it is very strong, but also the plot sequencing is great.
positive;positive;the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context.
negative;negative;jim brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just ha him standing there looking annoyed.
negative;positive;"too bad it all turn out to be a dream, which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short (almost a feature film at 46 minutes).there are inventive gag galore including charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat limburger cheese sent from home, then using the cheese a a weapon against the germans; charlie sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy; charlie disguising himself a a tree--one of his best sketch ever--and charlie pretending to beat up his friend who ha become a pow, then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight.one amazing feature is how much charlie, when he is behind enemy line dressed a a german, resembles hitler over ten year before hitler and his nazi thug rose to dominate german politics."
positive;positive;joel mccrea is in this film also, but ha a rather colorless part a andrea leeds boyfriend.
negative;negative;i saw this one on monstervision and joe bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and i do not have to much to say either.
negative;positive;"one more thing, too-- what, exactly, is so bad about judge turpin's performance of ""johanna"" that it is banned from the american theatre, but not the cannibal anthem ""a little priest""?otherwise, this is an excellent production."
positive;positive;it is a most touching work of art, weaving the serious, serene, and lighter side of life for this family.
positive;positive;so, lionel spends much of the movie following john--hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief.although i liked the film, i really think i had higher expectation for it and thought it might be better than just a very good time-passer.
negative;negative;no matter how much these idiot freak out and turn blue they can't leave it the hell alone.
negative;negative;even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistle from the male in the audience no one is ever going to mistake pam grier and margaret markov for sidney poitier and tony curtis.
positive;negative;of course none of that matters, because at first everyone always think that one's crazy.
positive;negative;lenzi invented the cannibal genre with man from deep river, deodato blew it away with jungle holocaust, lenzi fired back with eaten alive, deodato blew him (and everyone else) away with the superior cannibal holocaust, and lenzi fired a last parting salvo with cannibal ferox, which is about a realistic a that krazy glu commercial where the guy superglues his hardhat to a girder and hang in midair.this film is le desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewer into the abyss with everything holy than ferox, which remains a a sort of misguided attempt to upstage cannibal holocaust.
positive;positive;this film make viewer think hard.we need film like this to give u a boost.
positive;positive;so it's up to taylor (who is not known for his manly roles--especially at this stage of his career) to pose a a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man.however, there are two serious complications.
positive;positive;the famous film director (the protagonist) and the event he try to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating way a he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who ha never heard of him.
positive;positive;with so much hatred towards our current situation in the middle east, and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a film that show just how selfless and heroic these soldier are, a well a those awaiting their return.communist russia show how involved all were in the war.
negative;positive;or, even worse, watch the italian war movies.
positive;positive;underling this is a humorously wicked black streak.
negative;positive;i read some of the other review before picking up a used copy of this from amazon and wa glad i did.
positive;positive;also feature the the god-like ability of christopher nolan to write perfect dialogue.
negative;positive;i think it must have been the title that put me off.
positive;positive;yes, mickey make his debut here, in this cheery tale of life on board a steamboat.
negative;positive;i think i am some kind of road runner fan.
negative;positive;and isn't this guy from the new rob zombie movie?
negative;positive;thing spiral rapidly out of hand before degenerating completely.
negative;negative;"yes, it wa an awful movie, but there wa a song near the beginning of the movie, i think, called ""i got a woody"" or something to that effect."
positive;positive;if you can turn your brain off, and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick.
positive;positive;no, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great thing for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes.
negative;negative;in the book, he want nothing to do with vivan after she turn for him.
positive;positive;"the sonorous anchor grimly read a story about a ""grinding head-on collision"" before cheerfully introducing kimberley well (fonda), doing a story about a veterinarian who make house (or is that ""aquarium?"")"
negative;positive;it's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limit over his prague property by the devious occupants, he prof that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over.
positive;negative;"the title itself is only marginally appropriate: ""succubare"" is the latin verb meaning ""to lie beneath"", and it's the root of the word succubus, a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep."
negative;negative;"i remember another movie on a similar subject, ""the rapture,"" starring mimi rogers, that wa much better and professionally done."
positive;positive;it wa a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film lacked with an ridicilous ending. overall, a exellent comedy, full of laughs, and lot of fake green vomit.
negative;negative;abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil.
positive;negative;after elevating this, mile ha since appeared in the hollywood movie 'v for vendetta', and the 2001 star studded film 'the affair of the necklace', alongside brian cox, adrien brody, christopher walken and jonathan pryce.
negative;positive;little doe he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.to pas the time, holm cheerfully recites a ghost story.
positive;positive;isabella and her son wait for anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest.
negative;negative;($1.99 on amazon, and i had it rush delivered!
negative;negative;get the idea?missed opportunity the movie ha your standard cry and moaning passenger that are never developed.
negative;negative;a jaw-dropping, insanely terrible movie.
positive;negative;"down buenos aire way, a tyrannical hotel owner demand that his four daughter marry in order of age; one may think film take place in the 18th century, but no, it's modern-day 1942."
negative;negative;i have about a 20 minute to go.
positive;positive;"what strike you about the ""encounter"" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out."
negative;negative;"they even stole the whole infra-red vision p.o.v from the creature in ""predator"", which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective."
positive;positive;the settings, the lighting, the props... all add to the mood for love between the main characters.
negative;negative;"especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind.""paranormal state"" is all turn and no prestige."
positive;negative;the movie is based upon a really good and very topical idea but both the producer and the director simply applied the standard hollywood 'disaster movie' formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production.an unusually high tide and very strong gale condition combine to produce a record high storm surge that overwhelms london and flood most of the thames valley.
negative;positive;maybe we would go back to the real movies.
positive;negative;the juxtaposition of the two style is jarring.as for the acting, the best is done by judi dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy.
positive;negative;i first saw it when i wa about 13 or 14 year old, so it ha a great deal of nostalgic value for me.
positive;positive;ben stiller and tim robbins are great, i really like tim robbins character.
negative;negative;and the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either.**1/2 two and a half out of five star (average.)
negative;positive;i do think a couple of line did not need to be said but all in all it wa a great movie!
negative;positive;it wa well done.
positive;positive;it's a shame that he did not win any popular award for this one.last but in no way the least, shimit amin doe a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema.
negative;positive;he rarely get engaged in what is going on around him, ha never married, rarely socializes, just go to work and care for his invalid mother.
negative;negative;all over the place, no timing.the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time.
negative;negative;the kind that change the main plot piece in one way, this time, the k-9 play football instead of basketball.
positive;positive;loved this movie!!
positive;positive;the (relatively) happy girl gave good comic relief, a nice respite from the continual (but understandable) ragging on the dude who left them in a lurch.
positive;positive;i'm not very sure.a thought-provoking film on the whole and well worth watching.
negative;positive;"he'd once had a friend name george, ""a merry fellow"" who wa ""smarter than the rest of us."""
negative;positive;if you want to watch lonesome d. with robert duvall and tommy l. j. then watch the original.
positive;positive;rupert everett doe some of his finest work in unconditional a dirk.
positive;positive;yet they stick it out, for what?
negative;negative;i wonder if one guy on the credit = one drawing!
positive;negative;josh's mother is dating once again.
positive;positive;even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies.my favourite episode are the first three - these set the high standard that wa to continue.
positive;positive;the scene where nandita da loses her virginity to her husband certainly wa the first of it kind in indian cinemas.good acting by all the actor especially nandita da amidst criticism from the indian public
negative;negative;they should of just kill off all of them.
negative;negative;when i saw this at my local video store i thought my dream had come true.
negative;negative;"try not to laugh a you watch the tabonga toss fake native down hill & into quicksand, dodge spears, and lumber slowly about the ""island""."
negative;positive;i would love to see this movie again.
negative;positive;her reason for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.opinion: batman return is a classic.
positive;positive;"fassbinder's ""the merchant of the four seasons""."
positive;positive;the idea is to make the jackal look like a turncoat to the russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin.
negative;negative;if that guy didn't step on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway!
negative;positive;in fact, the actress playing johanna is not only off-tempo to a dismal degree, but also slightly off-key.
positive;positive;still they looked great in them so who's complaining?
negative;negative;"and then the ""big"" twist come (was this the third or fourth?)"
positive;positive;it ha wonderful special effect and the story fit together very well and is easy to follow.
negative;positive;(thus the 8/10 rating)
negative;positive;"we wondered, leaving the theatre, whether roxane's ""beard"" wa a wig."
positive;positive;ok, ten...
positive;positive;"the town xi'an is pronounced ""see-an"" , never ""zai-an""- surely the american voice-over speaker could have got that right !"
positive;positive;the actor did a good job plus the make-up crews.
negative;negative;if 20 different director were brought in to film different part of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors, this is pretty much the result i would expect.i also think some of the scene were spliced out of order - thing don't always seem to progress in order.
negative;negative;i am assuming that it wa discontinued very shortly after it release.
positive;positive;an educated and beautiful woman, binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she doe not accept the constraint imposed on her a a widow by her society.
positive;positive;the film begin with one of the goofiest scene i can remember in a film.
negative;negative;where's the suspence?
positive;positive;but i don't quite see what she find so charming about her new colleague, tom.
positive;positive;it's enough for ann that maggie knows.
negative;negative;plain and simple.
negative;negative;we need a new genre term for bad horror film like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic.
positive;negative;camera angle just weren't that good, especially regarding carrie's face.
negative;positive;i wa apprehensive about whether laugh would come or not?
positive;positive;soon tommy and brick are chasing after an attractive blonde at an officer's dance, tommy insult the captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter.
positive;negative;man with pitch black skin and patch of fur here and there.
negative;positive;cinema like this is sorely missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the british have the gumption to produce it.
positive;positive;also check out the jim henson hour if you can get your hand on it.
negative;negative;a married couple ha more then just each other.
negative;negative;if you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.what wa the purpose of this movie?
negative;positive;also, more of the key political player on both side should have been used, though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraint at the time.
negative;negative;having been a godzilla fan for many years, gamera wa to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of toho's #1 kaiju star.
positive;positive;absolutely a joy and must-see film... even if one's not an old hippie!!
positive;negative;keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out.
negative;negative;i have considered burning my copy but i have every intention on writing the producer and sending them the scripture reference that they should have read before making this movie!!
positive;positive;a thinking person's sexual thriller.
negative;positive;furtive meeting in underground car parks, code-breaking, stolen missile plans, that kind of thing.
negative;positive;then the virulent anti-semitism on that street catch him, despite his credential a a presbyterian wasp.
negative;negative;ancient rome: the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend.
negative;negative;the effect were better and the costume looked heap better then this movie.i borrowed this one with an open mind, i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and wa hoping it wa a decent movie.boy wa i wrong, the movie sucked, the monster wa pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary, the storyline wa so predictable it wa like watching the movie in preview mode, a i already would guess what will happen, the music wa so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.overall avoid this crappy movie.save some money.
negative;negative;he and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but thing just get deeper and darker a they go further into what they got themselves into.what could have been an alright thriller, turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie, which wa sad.
positive;negative;"definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it.first segment is called ""showdown""."
positive;positive;i didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs.
negative;negative;guess which category solo fall into.
positive;positive;first, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is stanwyck.
negative;negative;and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep.
negative;positive;it's fun to see kid take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do.
positive;positive;bruce willis give his always-outstanding comedic-romantic acting power to this message-movie and the movie brings hope to the loser many of u know we are.
negative;negative;standouts were peta wilson, who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part.
negative;positive;this movie wa recently shown subtitled not dubbed, on australia's special broadcasting service.
negative;negative;this tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de-evolution is not well known from the theatrical run (did it have one?)
negative;negative;it's of the same banal ilk and therefore equally devoid of intelligence.
negative;positive;it wa very authentic in how they displayed the component dealing with this movie which includes the guns, horses, and clothing.
negative;positive;please to whom it my concern, please make this movie available so all can have this historical experience.
negative;negative;pulled it off, because it wa meant to resemble old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink....it's sad.
negative;negative;"the title of said game is ""backwater,"" but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothing.and so we begin the movie..."
negative;positive;his counterpart wa formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him.
positive;positive;what make this film different are mainly it acting & style.
negative;negative;one of the only barely funny moment wa when the leading lady made a joke about her former friend plastic t*ts, which would have been okay if i hadn't had to watch them bob around whenever she waddled on the screen.the lowest i can give is one, & it probably deserves that for having heather thomas in it, a she wa certainly sexy & shapely, though her acting wa a bad a everyone else.
negative;negative;trite and tiring, the one-liner almost made me cry.
positive;positive;it also focus on the history of skateboarding.
negative;positive;!..bottom line, see this movie!!
negative;positive;(yes, octopussy made more money.)
negative;negative;i saw this video at a friend house, and it wa the lamest thing i have seen ever.
negative;positive;"hour and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing!the main plot is about a bunch of clueless actor trying to bring on scene ""prometheus"",but there are lot of sub-plots,like the disappearing of thomas and a crazy guy looking for monsieur warok....what's the meaning of all this??"
positive;negative;i couldn't stand the scene with her - i.e.
positive;positive;the mascot feature new technique i have not yet seen in starewicz's films.
negative;negative;or when she is cutting six inch off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch.
positive;positive;raima sen gave her first great performance that i have seen.
positive;negative;a solid 3.0.
negative;negative;he doesn't want to share quarter with the 'negros'.
positive;negative;the resultant crime is that award have become meaningless and small, le powerful pr-driven film become obscure.
negative;negative;theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewer to this christian propaganda.
negative;negative;whatever.it make zero sense.
negative;negative;it's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film.
negative;positive;this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy.
positive;positive;!the aggregate catastrophe of world war ii ha mirrored most americans' feeling of personal human inadequacy a well!
positive;positive;the filming is worthy of this film stock.3.
positive;negative;even the always dependable henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance.
positive;positive;it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitude and prejudice will be changed.
negative;negative;this isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer.in the end, it's eminently clear that the director think that ibm cheated, and the repeated comment about ibm's stock rising 15% the day that deep blue won suggest the idea that ibm cheated to pump it stock price (kasparov even compare ibm and deep blue to enron).
negative;negative;solomon kane look like it is based on the video game dark watch, and it sound like it is based on the video game legacy of kane, but unfortunately neither is true.
positive;positive;twig and newspaper shred come to life.
negative;negative;but if this wa a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism.
negative;negative;no!
negative;positive;they did some tweaking to some story line from the manga, but it all turned out pretty well.
negative;positive;only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat o'malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart.
positive;positive;at the movie's conclusion, danglard, having outfoxed the creditor and the jealous babes, approach a new attraction watching the incredible (and believe me, it is incredible) performance of the cancan.
negative;positive;the last bus ride and the final kiss)but i do have one grouse--why do hollywood never acknowledge the source that inspire the stories?
positive;positive;now it's a standoff--slaughter ha the list but if he doesn't give it back, the lady is dead.
positive;negative;maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan?
positive;positive;i can't recall any film with mckinley or dewey in it a a character, though i do remember roosevelt from the wind and the lion and a couple other films.
negative;positive;another thing about the holocaust that i kind of disagree with the documentary...is that i don't believe it wa just a matter of discrimination...but rather something deeper and more profound, and that wa just an act of pure evil.
positive;positive;"the last 45 minute are a dream-like a what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in film about nightmare and dreams.lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own lost highway and blue velvet."
negative;negative;pullman adeptly act the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem.
positive;positive;oscar-caliber acting, always.sapsorrow - everybody love 'the soldier and death,' but something about 'sapsorrow' push it an iota higher in my favor.
positive;positive;everyone try to cover it up except fonda and douglas, so douglas steal the film.
positive;positive;they are the lowest form of scum, but it still find a way to allow you to understand a lot of the character and even care about their stories.the violence in the show is necessary for it to be a realistic a possible, but the show isn't about the violence like some people might believe.
negative;positive;that's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera?
negative;positive;"aside from a select few line of dialogue (""we have to stop it!"""
negative;negative;the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending.
negative;negative;and of not being.- i think the worst fault, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth.
negative;negative;"@#$ is gunna be big, yo!"""
negative;positive;sir alec guinness make a special appearance, too.
negative;negative;).i found the movie offensive, not a an argentinian, but a a watcher.
negative;negative;but, can you say moby dick?there are so many retarded scene in this movie.
negative;positive;a big bravo to all involved.
positive;positive;the brother fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and a an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first peacetime draft in united state history.
positive;negative;"if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment, i'd say those big tax euro spent at supporting ""culture"" have gone to waste here in a horrible way."
negative;positive;"he ""goes through the motions,"" but we learn precious little about the man within."
negative;negative;sorry.
negative;negative;"and more than that, i think he wa forced to pattern his show a the ""hispanic/latino/spanish"" version of the dave chappelle show."
negative;negative;and incredibly, no one noticed his footprint in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him.
negative;negative;this is never presented in the movie, they show it a if it were a sledding accident.the character change in mattie and zenna are almost non-existent.
negative;negative;just a recommendation.so give it a chance, and a u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it...
negative;negative;this movie wa pure trash.
negative;negative;looking at the rating you would assume this is a classic, but yet again it just another example of poor independent film maker trying to drum up interest in their movie.
negative;negative;ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers, i thought... which gave the film's maker far too much credit.
negative;negative;i wa quite pleasantly surprised: it certainly wasn't a masterpiece but the acting wa good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situation of which i looked forward to finding the solution to.
positive;positive;amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions!
negative;negative;actually though, i did start laughing at some point because the turn of event wa again just too predictable, over-the-top and incredible.who doe this crap?
positive;positive;this director, however, ha managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and d.a.
positive;positive;"still interesting today although it doe have an ""old movie"" look to it."
negative;negative;awful!
negative;negative;i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression.
negative;negative;"after all, jean-luc goddard, the contrarian french egghead, dedicated ""a bout de souffl√©"" to monogram, so they can't have been all that bad."
positive;positive;however, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making it presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that vatican city is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals.
negative;negative;"oh yeah the saw 2 tag line sound real promising: ""oh yes, there will be blood."""
positive;positive;you should be able to sense the power and rawness zep had in their early days.
negative;negative;the child survive, so it's obvious they are going to let jill survive.
negative;negative;"seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie wa going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.fans of ""beat"" takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.2/10"
positive;positive;i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.
positive;positive;you'll see actor playing william mckinley, teddy roosevelt and admiral dewey.
positive;negative;the loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such a that encountered by both the icon themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well-captured in image such a that wherein 'marilyn monroe' (a gorgeous samantha morton) seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest, or when 'sammy davis, jr.' (jason pennycooke) settles, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake.as it is, moment like these, and all those where the title of randomly-chosen michael jackson song crawl across the scene, are married to one another in a film narrative far le affecting than it should be.(for those who see it, i lost all faith during the egg-singing scene, late on.
positive;positive;nothing else but pure evil.excellent documentary of anne frank and of the holocaust that should be watched.
positive;positive;when the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cat first, the butler is angered, because he want to get everything first.
negative;negative;bottom line: passport to paris is one of the worst movie ever made.
positive;negative;echoed through the theater, showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america ha to offer.
negative;negative;i know i wouldn`t , and seeing a you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $25,000 dollar all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheque ?
positive;positive;you wonder what will happen next, while at the same time, feeling you saw something happen.nice score, too.
positive;positive;this is an excellent documentary about am√°lia rodrigues.
negative;positive;in some scenes, entire line of dialogue were replaced or reordered - while the scene itself wa untouched.
negative;positive;to jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business.
negative;positive;nevertheless, it had to be done a every challenge need to be met with equal determination.
negative;positive;i no more than finished the movie and began calling my friend to recommend it.
positive;negative;the movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane.
negative;negative;this movie wa so predictable and poorly acted.
positive;positive;personally the definitive interpretation of the robin hood legend.
negative;positive;the scene where he ha to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster ¬ñ oh my god!
positive;positive;in one, an aimless deserter, pike, having lost his trading partner, steal a miraculous horse, eagle's wing, so-called because of it grace and speed.
negative;negative;it also figure that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny trekkie brain.
positive;negative;"sexy sarah bay, who ha played in cow-ntless european b-films, usually a rosabla neri, including ""hercules against the moon men"", play his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress."
positive;negative;here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity.
negative;positive;secret agent os 117 is stupid, but at least he sort of know it, whereas i've always found that james bond wa stupid but acted like a smart arse.
positive;positive;what give the show more credence is the latest technology the cell/fbi us and the authentic shot in europe, the u and the middle east, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately the cast are relatively unknown but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly-written script that constantly keep the viewer on edge with many unexpected twist and turns.
positive;positive;it's a realistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random fact because lorelai gilmore is always making references.
negative;positive;i have never forgot this movie.
positive;positive;this is a hollywood film.
positive;positive;the direction is self assured, especially with local who were recruited on the fly for extra and bit parts.
negative;negative;"stupidity-caused disaster movie with glowing, heartwarming ending sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, ""no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed."""
positive;negative;(come to think of it, i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars.
negative;positive;"right the hospital scene with holly and shannon wa done brilliantly it start off with piper on a gurney looking very badly injured, the doc race her into a resuscitation room & they move her from the gurney onto a bed and prue hold her hand from that point on it is obvious that piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lung are failing, a she turn to beg of prue to not leave her side she gap ""don't go i love you and then her pulse drop and she go into cardiac arrest & the monitor show a clear flat line & the nurse go into full out trauma mode & bring in a defibrillator prue step back from the bed in horror a the doctor desperately try to shock her dying sister heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girl"
negative;negative;the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques, which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them.
negative;negative;"in the end she and her husband (james marsden) choose to kill norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.kelly dance around his film's ""message"", trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is."
negative;positive;of course, james then isn't so eager to rush to the police.
negative;negative;being a long-time fan of japanese film, i expected more than this.
negative;negative;i really tried to tap into the (so called) silly & surreal humor that this film set out to be.
positive;positive;he is the hero, the most charming, disarming rickshaw driver you will ever encounter- he's magical.
positive;negative;and arthur franz a the pipe-smoking head scientist, the pride of perth amboy, new jersey.
negative;positive;"kurt russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of macready, and, a a direct result he ""feels"" like a real person, rather than a hollywood ""all american hero""."
positive;positive;the film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from tv show and news reports, and the label via subtitle let you know where you are in term of the time line.
negative;positive;"not even the recent flick ""gangs of new york"" can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang."
positive;positive;the sheperd: border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences.
positive;positive;she did a simply amazing job.natalie portman also did a great job.
negative;negative;no redeeming feature at all.
negative;negative;silly crap.
negative;negative;don't waste your time, or money.
positive;positive;i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buff and indian ex-pats.
negative;negative;"it is way below limit be called ""professional""."
positive;positive;one of the most famous of all movie serials!
positive;positive;i've got nothing too much to comment on this one due to it brevity.human larva is one of the film lynchpin and it is a totally unflinching portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who ha an incestuous love for his pregnant sister.
positive;positive;and his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination, although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn't very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on, probably about five time longer than it wa worth.
negative;positive;bill hickman wa the driver of the bad guy car in both movies.
positive;positive;this movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations.
negative;positive;female moviegoer were not shortchanged: fox's handsomest young contract player, jeffrey hunter, is a photogenic a ms. paget, while michael rennie lurks around in the background, stirring up evil doings in the land of the pyramids.
positive;positive;the incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.
negative;positive;there are also those, who, however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film, think that the illness manifest itself a a result of some sort of supernatural influence.
negative;positive;"a i watching this based-on-a-real-life story, i wa thinking, ""nobody is this nice, this tolerant."""
negative;positive;some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant, from the pencil is the rear-end, to the rubber sex-pants, a well wa the infamous line that richie say when he fall and a candle he is carrying go into his eye.
negative;negative;make you forget what a terrible movie you're watching.almost.two stars.
negative;negative;neither did i.it's bad (it wa mst'd, after all) and also a golan-globus production but after all is said and done, ireland just basically look lost, like she's trying to find where the photographer are so she can do a photo shoot instead.and i don't blame her.one star.
positive;negative;will child enjoy this movie?
negative;positive;it wasn't a epic a musa-the warrior and didn't develop the character a well, but it had many nice ideas.
negative;negative;a he's made to run into the reynolds' house, under her control, a mad a a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled hal.
negative;positive;madison walk a careful balancing act a riordan, handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.playing a role similar to that of john wayne in `fort apache' madison doe a more skillful job at it.this movie ha a `silverado' type camaraderie.
negative;negative;it just look horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.so, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity?
positive;positive;plus let face it, tim burton wa a genius and did the comic book character more justice than joel screwmacher ever did.plot: oswald cobblepot also know a the penguin(played by danny devito) is abandoned by his parent a child for being deformed.
negative;positive;fact.)
negative;negative;how wrong i was.for five whole minute i thought i wa in the clear.
positive;negative;well, definitely, asterix is not made to move!
positive;positive;it ha that home-made, gritty quality that beavis and butt-head or south park would later have.
negative;positive;"in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet, literature's most famous ""star crossed"" lover that fall for each other at first sight and problem arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scene even use the original, or close to original, lines."
positive;positive;and so incredibly real.
negative;positive;also it's far too short--i didn't believe the romance between gere and lane for a second.
negative;negative;the whole story wa bad.
negative;positive;thankfully the chaotic ending cement all that ha gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin a wide a nutbourne rail station, great fun 8/10.
negative;positive;"this is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike ""honey..."" and ha more effect than the spectacular ""muppetvision"""
negative;positive;it come together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.this is a great short film for the following reasons: 1.
negative;negative;the soundtrack sucked.
positive;negative;"i think those were on par with the ""matrix"" movie and ""transformers"" bravo you guys!"
negative;negative;"i kept wondering if i wa watching the same movie a those who wrote all those ""lovely"" comments."
positive;positive;it a great movie.
negative;negative;editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess?
positive;positive;so it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting.
negative;negative;this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes, it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain!
positive;positive;a the movie is almost slapstick funny with it gore scene there are still a few creepy moments.this is a cool flick but don't expect anything marvelous.
negative;negative;but, don't mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi.
negative;negative;moment but the tension builds, the bad guy are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely.
positive;positive;the film ¬ñ written and directed entirely by anthony waller ¬ñ is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspect and horror influences.
negative;negative;laura gemser is in it along with her husband gabriele tinti, but that is the only connection to emanuelle.
negative;negative;i've seen it before.if you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no over repetitiveness, this is not for you then.
positive;positive;simply great!
negative;negative;but i had to turn my face away when they kissed.
positive;positive;sonny chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good.
negative;negative;yaaayyyy!!!!
positive;positive;yet she prays a lot, a doe her family.
negative;negative;"i wanted something that wa mindless and that i could just sit back and say, ""what the hell were they thinking?"""
negative;negative;why doe the camera make old-school kung fu noise when it zooms?
negative;positive;it's not near a bad a the shawshank redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ear if you are little.
negative;negative;no sense of timing, nothing inspired.
negative;positive;i grew up in baltimore, so i wa exposed to the film of john waters, since i wa way too young to watch them.
positive;positive;there are several shot of jim at home, lonely and thinking of leila, including a powerful scene when he find one of her old dress in the closet.
negative;positive;you may recognize his voice, a he also furnished the voice of baloo the bear in the jungle book, and little john in disney's robin hood.
negative;negative;director/screenwriter allan burn seems to have patched two different script together before coming up with this minor outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage.
negative;negative;she seemed to have no transportation or companion with her.
negative;positive;nothing changed in that 10 or so year since the time she may have read faulkner's book and saw his movie while in college in alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it a her own in later years.
negative;positive;i mean, don't get me wrong, i liked the film.
positive;positive;the story line is typical, but full of jocular surprises, especially concerning the unconventional relationship between granger, gardner and niven.
positive;positive;dumb of the hatred and greedy opinion of an over-indulgent society.
negative;negative;hmm, i wonder who the police's main suspect will be?
negative;negative;philip s. hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pale to renee zelweger's appearance a a corn-fed dynamo who burst miraculously upon the scene of kidman's lonely farm to save the day.
negative;negative;a group of seven people fear they are the only survivor of a near world ending h-bomb blast.
positive;positive;"sure it's fairly straightforward, but the concept of ""swapping murders"" is simply one that would not fly in film of today's day and age, which make it all the more entertaining to watch; the film's brilliant screenplay keep the action flowing at a swift pace while providing u with some wonderfully memorable line all the while."
positive;positive;the delicate marina zudina give a harrowing portrayal of the american mute girl billy.
negative;negative;it's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.carols mencia go further - he disrespect everyone for what he assumes is comedy.
positive;positive;even simple sound effect were added/omitted from each version - having a major impact on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene.
positive;positive;i always appreciate such glimpse at the old movie sets.the end of the film is it's strongest part.
negative;negative;since there's no real plot and the script is so crappy, you cant expect any real character development, or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, they simply add some disconnected dramatic music, which signal you that something very dramatic is going on , instead of actually creating something dramatic..the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie, and a complete waste of time which somehow got an incredibly high score for it level, probably because of the cast - and this is exactly what the producer where counting on.
positive;positive;the event of the film are based on a true story.timothy hutton and sean penn are convincing in the lead part and develop interesting characterizations.
positive;negative;time to smash!anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies, because it ha pretty decent fx for 1957.
positive;negative;along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one wa dishing out.
negative;positive;united artist spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by william cameron menzies.
negative;negative;there might be some laugh in it that escaped me.
negative;negative;it's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre.
negative;positive;thing wa fine for a while.
negative;negative;after watching it i walk out like, what happened?
negative;positive;when one of the character dy the others have to cope and adjust.
positive;positive;seven month since a revelatory viewing of faces, i finally found a rentable dvd copy of cassavetes' first feature.
negative;positive;i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it.
positive;negative;"anycow, because his doughy, vacant wife, korey, played amateurishly by suzanne ridgeway(""love's a-poppin'""), help set him up, kimo declares his revenge on her and all of the elders."
positive;positive;but most of all, it showed the vitality, since muted by the inroad of giuliani, disney and tourism.what i wouldn't give to be young again.
negative;negative;"the movie could've saved itself by using character or some kind of story device to reprimand or ""redeem"" idiot character who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes)."
negative;positive;"in his description of caa, platinum card lunch in hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in provincetown he never took, and free trip to nicaragua, financed by columbia pictures.it sound narcissistic, but spalding gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) rope the audience in, laugh at himself (perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and get u to care.this monologue is not just about ""the killing fields"", or ""swimming to cambodia""; it is more a pastiche of events, a he see them."
negative;positive;this movie pack a punch.
negative;negative;but then, they paid for love actually.
negative;negative;this is √ºber-trash, i'm talking 'manos'-level crap, meaningless, unwatchable, not-even-so-bad-it's-good, cinematic bile of the highest order.lance henriksen is harlan knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristic or personality.
positive;positive;while you don't see anything graphic, this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene.
negative;negative;my mom brought me this movie on a dvd.
negative;positive;"his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in case like this and that lead the cop straight to jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.""beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/on whom she can rely,"" begin the graf poem."
positive;negative;the best thing you can say about the director/actor/egotist is that he's got great taste in music.
positive;positive;the pr flack (james hampton) show fonda and douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant, built by westinghouse.
negative;positive;we don't yet know who david holm is, or why this nurse wish to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time.
positive;positive;is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status a fiction?
positive;negative;i must say, when i saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, i figured it wa well worth a view.
positive;negative;what's so unique about him?
negative;positive;the naacp ha voiced no contest for race issues, and let u not forget amos n andy wa a huge hit in the 50's a a tv series.
negative;negative;i'm told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america (go figure!
positive;negative;girl find boy, girl love boy, girl loses boy, girl find boy.
negative;positive;all lies!
positive;positive;"but after hanging out with each other on lonely night (while their spouse are away ""on business""/""taking care of a sick mother""), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.several factor are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among ""romantic melodramas,"" in the best sense of that term."
positive;positive;his past, we come to learn, is one of chaos and conflict.
positive;positive;"it's a thrill to watch people do what they love-- and i'm not even peripherally talking about ""meat pie with a twist""."
negative;negative;a low point for all involved except perhaps bologna, who must sit up night trying to figure out which bomb wa the bomb that destroyed his career.
negative;negative;it doe have a few known name in it (casper van dien, erika eleniak, coolio).
positive;positive;the inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and i wa in tear by the end along with most of the audience.
negative;negative;so simple, that the movie is not evolving until the end.
negative;negative;they were admittedly inferior wlthout question but there wa entertainment value here and that caught on for sure .
negative;positive;it wa a complete and utter joy to watch.
negative;negative;this film doe not entertain.
negative;positive;let's filter the more judgmental..ok, are you interested in the fact concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer?
negative;negative;the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-year-old virgin, complete with several of carell's past co-stars, a reference to the flick on a theater marquee, and another musical closing credit sequence.
positive;positive;"the best word to describe it is ""genius""!"
positive;negative;following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.through all this, the film maker also incorporated a lot of clich√©, which i suspect wa intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth a well a shallowness which i found intriguing.
positive;positive;the main conflict between the two is that, while antonio love his little town and ha no wish to leave it, karina want to see the world and resents the place.
negative;negative;the family way, spring and port wine, get carter, the long good friday, trainspotting....don't get me wrong i like a bit of escapist hokum.
negative;negative;at any rate, he's in need of a haircut, badly, distractingly badly.
negative;positive;the film consists of 57 vignette shot mostly by a still camera, and it wa the careful design of each of these scene which required much time.
negative;positive;i rented this movie, but i wasn't too sure what to expect of it.
positive;positive;"one can't help but notice the deeper theme hitchcock is alluding to throughout a well, especially the concept of ""darkness in humanity's heart"", demonstrated by elderly lady being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, a well a bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death."
negative;negative;"the worst sin ""fuckland"" committed wa to express such a statement about it own director.the continuous impression i received wa that the director wa too busy trying to impress u for sneaking a camera inside the island to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie."
negative;negative;the character had several opportunity to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons.
negative;negative;the misogyny of this film is painful a well.
negative;negative;of the two episode i watched each revolved around violent, nasty hauntings tied to violent, nasty deaths.
negative;negative;"it truly deserves to be on the imdb list of the 100 worst of all time, and ha never left the top 3 on my personal ""worst"" list."
positive;negative;tom everret scott's performance is amatuerish at best, and he and julie delpy, who play his love interest, don't seem to have any chemistry together at all.
positive;positive;15 park avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata.
negative;negative;none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale.given the choice i'd take a pass.
negative;negative;you'd think the zombie would look somewhat like what the cover-art of the box displays, but instead, you get actor with mask that are clearly sold at any halloween display counter.
negative;negative;"like ""the blair witch project"" before it, ""hatchet"" ha garnered it own fair share of publicity from the bottom-on-up (as an avid reader of fangoria magazine, the full-page ad are hard to miss); even after it middling theatrical run, the film is bound to subsist solely on the hype surrounding it, and will probably turn into a cult item at some point."
positive;positive;concludes holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.as fate ha it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter result in holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight.
positive;negative;this is not a good film.
negative;negative;wayne newton in the cast a a talent agent is a novelty but he add nothing - comedically or otherwise.overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that go over like a lead balloon.
negative;negative;the direction, dialogue, and visual effect are just horrible.
negative;negative;nooo!
positive;positive;i am sure it is great also.
positive;negative;it's child abuse.
positive;negative;kathy ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a smurf.and the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite.

positive;positive;i thought it wa an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv.
negative;positive;almost all of the subplots (particularly, the reckless colonel) have been done better elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity.
negative;negative;three absolutely pointless segments, all featuring the director playing himself -- and he's not that interesting.

negative;negative;"between merle haggard's narration and the statler brother singing corny(stupid) song like ""ride little cowboy"" being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious."
negative;negative;milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick mikey, if you actually check it up both film have the same tagline!but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.the acting is terrible and the flashback scene are overwhelmingly confusing.
negative;positive;all good movies, but the rest of the top-grossing movie are usually cliched tripe with non-sensical plot and lot of eye candy.
negative;negative;it wa a non-moving story that definitely doe not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critic say about the film the 3 main actor are good, and there is a few laugh but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hope of it getting better and it just doesn't.
positive;positive;and a great musical score.
negative;positive;so, a much a india think of itself a a pluralistic, tolerant society, the fact are not always so.
negative;negative;richard kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal, human conversation.
positive;positive;this is the best 3-d experience disney ha at their themeparks.
negative;negative;he becomes a beast and begin to kill even his own comrades.
negative;negative;perhaps the costume department wa going for gritty, but all they got wa dirty and dingy.since the movie wa completely true to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more.
positive;positive;the best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it.
negative;negative;i recorded it a it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i wa not seeing things!

negative;negative;ah, andy milligan.
positive;positive;the performance by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turn by oleg yankovsky and igor volkov a the russian murderers.this riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller.
negative;positive;early day i know, but lane act her sock off here.
positive;positive;also, the king wa probably one of the creepiest character's i've seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, weird eye (usually crossed), and a soft but scary voice.

negative;negative;whoever employ this sylvestra le touzel lady ha got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress i've ever seen in my life.
negative;negative;the acting is horrible, the pacing is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is laughably bad.
negative;negative;"oh, and btw: i don't believe that any young actress listens to classical music; wa jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music?"
positive;negative;the monster's apparent intent is to rebuild it race using human being a food and giant wombs.

positive;negative;but director umberto lenzi, usually acknowledged a a deodato rip-off, directed the man from deep river 3 year earlier in 1972.
negative;positive;you'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different.
positive;negative;"(i should know, that's what i did) if you loved ""tales from the crypt"", you'll love ""two-fisted tales"" too because basically it's all the same."
negative;negative;"the ""acting"" is god awful and the plot non-existent.here are a few incident from my one year in hall of residence.1) a posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite."

negative;negative;there wa laughter in the theater at moment that were in no way supposed to be funny.
negative;negative;but the poor guy wa stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplay and direction and budget he worked under.
negative;positive;mna i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick.

positive;positive;don't let the pg rating keep you away, this film prof that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining.
positive;positive;but then again, what is perceived a reality here is not very much different from the dreams.despite the fact that the film lack a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main character a such, the different character who appear and reappear in different scene still meet each other and their story are inevitably intertwined.

positive;negative;it's foolish but funny.
